Awesome place Very quick service Wide choice of beer and delicious food
One of the bests pubs in Kharkiv It is a good place for taking several beers after work with nice snacks Also there is a good lunch menu The staff always are friendly and helpful
Atmospheric Irishstyled pub with tasty kitchen and fast service But it has a couple of drawbacks as for me  take into account bad air conditioning in some places of room a bit expensive menu with short list of simple drinks and specific taste of some cocktails
I like this place You can find a special atmosphere there As for me I choose this pub if I want to drink tasty beer or watch football matches
The best place for eating and drinking Very good service and food Business lunches are also very tasteful
Super comfy place to eat The staff were nice and supportive Price is reasonable and I love the variety of food Will visit again pretty soon
Very good place nice interior good beer snd drinks decent staff and polite owner Food isnt the best for high expectation customers Give it a try
Nice food nice prices nice waiters all around good place Theres separate lunch menu Thumbs up I recommend to all this place
Went to the pub alone looking for somewhere to watch English football and get something to eat had a meal and a few drinks good price very clean and smart bar the staff are very friendly and nice great time
I spent an evening at Marshals42 on a trip and liked their meals I had the burger and it was fresh and delicious
Great location to sit together with some friends The staff is always friendly and burgers are great 
Found this place through the recommendation Great selection of beers and tasty burgersDefinitely worth the visit
Cosy place huge windows let you see the whole street from inside the pub pity that this part of centtal street had only views of trafficing to offer Menu is pretty wide  you have snacks starters salads soups and main courses Beer  around 20 taps pretty much the same set you have around the city Bonus  wide whiskey menu Overall you dont feel like in pub inside it is a beer restaurant
Amazing pub in the heart of the city Wide local craft beers selection Good food good prices
It is one of my favorite craft beer pub in Kharkiv There is always large options of bottled beer and on tap Great service Recommend
Lots of choice for beer though portersstouts are dominating But staff is just amazing and unique all with certain personality and with easygoing helpful attitude Great place to chill and meet some good people Snacks are great too by the way
I LOVE THIS PLACE If I could just live here I probably would
Entering this bar I saw the picture of Ozzy and was expecting something extravagant I was not disappointed at all The design is pretty simple however the writings on the wall from the visitors make it somehow good although some of them are not that pleasant There is a bunch of football scarfs which can be interesting and probably there can be a live music but at that time the background music was fitting perfectly for the drinking The grape cider is just amazing and chicken wings were delicious but the amount kinda let me down Overall I would definitely go back
Say Im biased because Im an old rocker but I like places like this a lot probably because there are fewer and fewer of them  In any case in addition to beer of course with the sounds of the good old rock you can drink good coffee here enjoy sporting events on two large TVs and to eat 
Nice pub extremely friendly staff Good foof and several Ukranian beers They helped us book a taxi and when it was delayed they kept the place open for us and made sure we got safely back to the hotel
The stuff didnt understand me on English The new selfservevsystem useful and comfortable because it save waiting time in quie
I bought in Mc drive big potatoes  1fish roll and a small cola received the package once i wanted to eat i realized there is no potatoes  i was already 10 km far from the city so better to check what u ordered as u still there
It was renovated not long ago were installed terminals for selfordering Yet its just MacDonalds so nothing too fancy is expected so 5 stars for them being good MacDonalds
This McDonalds cafe is very clean with a very nice design The staff is very friendly and very customer oriented the only problem is that this McDonalds is located across from the central market many people come from the market to use the bathrooms and its not uncommon to see long lines of people waiting to use the bathrooms this can be a big inconvenience for McDonalds customers
Everything is delicious and atmospheric Cool But hire more people The guy is a waiter and serves the halls alone and stands at the bar and so on Sometimes tables come and go there are not enough people to serve all the tables one person cannot do it
The dishes are super the waiter too Raise Sergeys salary urgently and 5 points for the muzlo
Very tasty If you want to spend a good evening with a large company or two I advise you to visit this institution Thanks to all the staff 
 For a residential area the pub is very atmospheric Nice renovation in loft style everything is beautiful Serving dishes on boards beer glasses in the shape of a skull flags in burgers and black gloves are classy Been here twice The first time everything was great I really liked the pizza with pear and cheese and the delicious dark beer   The table was booked in advance for February 14 there was one waiter he was also at the bar Unfortunately I didnt like the service but its not the waiters fault he just didnt have time to do everything and looked tired There was no additional festive decoration of the hall Only 4 tables were occupied When they arrived even the background music was turned off We waited for drinks for half an hour my beer was brought later than everyone else The burgers were brought already cold my order was brought only after my husband and daughter had already eaten the burgers so the food experience was spoiled The prices are not low  We ask the owner not to skimp on staff especially on holidays For the first time after our visit we were glad that there was such an establishment nearby After the second visit the impression was spoiled and we are unlikely to come again
the most offal thing they are just like a gang to hit people who came to have fun by the way all of them the security and the waiters and the Clints who are friends of them So Hershey is bad bad bad bad bad bad
Place for eat and drink and smoke hookah Prices slightly higher then quality
ok place Nothing special but they have their own made beer
It is far from center but very good place for Saltovka area
Food is always good If you are into football the games are always on
Best Irish pub in town Great beers and delicious food
Love this place good food good beer and good atmosphere and the whiskey here is good
Its just bad
Cool place Liked it a lot The atmosphere is fire  Even next to the house

I really liked it I recommend it to everyone
Nice restaurant on Sumskaya Street They have open area for smokers Inside you may enjoy with live local music with local people If you like vodka than you should try Nemiroff
Great mix of Bar Restaurant and Music Hall Definitely worth one or more visits
Great food meat fish salads and a big beer and snacks selection They have a minimal amount of money to spend per person if you want to be seated but prices are mostly reasonable and the usual meal should be enough to get the required amount for the second floor They usually have some event every evening so it can be noisy inside
Concert organization is very poor Overcrowded place without any limitations of attendees Beer was bad But you can find pretty good business lunches here
This is the best beer restaurant in Kharkiv The prices are reasonable the dishes are very tasty During the quarantine all requirements are met there is no menu on the tables all staff are masked and gloved at the table strictly up to 4 people In contrast for example from Kharitonov A good program in evening with singers
Nice and funny beer place for big companies Good kitchen and locally brewed beer Recommend
If you would like to see local Ukrainian restaurant you should visit this place Its very noisy buy joyful in the same time You may enjoy with the song contest
One of the best place to have fun Do reservation before you go
Nice and delicious place if you prefer Italian food but waiting time at lunch for me was around 3040 min
Great interior design very nice and chill place to spend some time with friends cause food is amazing and really good quality products are used Staff is absolutely friendly and attentive They always check your satisfaction with a smile and keep on doing their Best We are very Happy with my wife and strongly reccomend to visit this place at least once

Excellent pizza and very tasty home wine
Great place on weekends
Nice place peaceful and quiet delicious and quick
Nice place
We booked sun loungers for the day threw off the prepayment As a result everything was busy no one was waiting for us The administrators began to move people to free the sun loungers waited for the waiter for a very long time took the order did not take out the dishes all at once the pork steak waited more than an hour while the girls had already eaten  the steak was with a layer of rubber fat I waited for the waiter to find out 15 min the answer was it was normal etc I asked the administrator saying that I would be at the pool he comes and says you asked for the type of administrator  why they supposedly left Im sorry I I came to rest and wait half an hour for everyone well thats too much At the expense of the pool if you have children yes its cool but if you came to relax you wont succeed the children jump the water is all on you the admins say but these are children  this is a question for parents No impressions from the service to the atmosphere
Nice cozy pub with very pleasant waitresses
Food is not fresh very pricey and poor service

Its down an interesting allyway and looks nice Only went as a Czech friend has never been to an Irish pub Its not really Irish they have no Guinness or Murphys thats the ONE rule to being an Irish bar But pleasant enough I suppose

Have been here meny times Great beers and food Always Perfect service Highly recommend
Probably the worst service ever  I went there to watch the match of my team The waitress ignored me and spoke to me in Russian very rude and kind of upset to me just because I said to them  excuse me do you speak English  AVOID THIS PLACE very rude people working there
Worse and worse each year Today they forgot our order so we had to wait for ONE HOUR And yep it tasted bad btw administration is a hell they think it is ok Definitely cannot be recommended anymore
Whiskey specialists They have one place inside the bar with only whiskey to drink This place is very nice decorated with big selection of whiskey

If youre into brown pubs this is the place Good selection of beer and drinks Didnt eat myself but saw they had a rich food cart Nice guy with a beard working here also he was cool
Its a really Britishlooking pub Gets pretty crowded in the evening and you can feel pub atmosphere There is some beer variety they also have food which I didnt get to try Its a bit pricey for Odessa but not too bad
Honestly speaking quite awful place Staff seems to really hate u Its like being back in ussr Would you like anything else except dessert and coffee Really do I have to order bottle of whisky
Tasty food and good service
Nice design but the stuff is working and acting like theyre on a funeral  unresponsive and slow  Food is soso nothing to write home about
Dont go to this dive bar Dont expect much walking in the door The place is never busy and the drinks suck The owner pushed away his only serious clientele because of a soviet era mindset There are many other bars to go to and spend money in Odessa Dont sell your self short
Good craft beers choices tasty snacks good music Steak burger is tasty
Very cozy bar for lovers of craft beer There are tasting sets Pleasant music Recommend
Great choice of craft beers and awesome and enthusiastic staff loved it and recommend
Been to this bar several times Delicious cuisine Prices are at a minimum when compared to the city center The acoustics are on point Nice dance floor Unfortunately the bar is not open We are waiting for its opening
Nice place you can have a drink eat and sing of course 
The best shashlik in Odessa good service great beer selection from all over the world prices are democratic and the place is nice if you mean to eat shashlik in Odessa dont miss it
Delicious food professional crew tasty beer nice interior
cozy place where you can have a good rest with your friends would suggest
The best pub ever
The kitchen is terrible Even something that should be normally prepared in a beer establishment garlics shrimp chips They have nothing only beer Service is normal The viewing atmosphere is also nothing
The choice of beer is not very good the price is too high Snack for beer Odessa crustaceans not very fresh usually a week old Chips are good but the portion is small
Perfect place TV panels are everywhere And even where I didnt expect  I recommend Sit with friends and watch footballthe best place The staff is pleasant and the food is excellent SUPER 
Being a guest of the city he visited this bar to watch matches I am satisfied with the establishment the atmosphere is bombastic enjoyed watching the matches Thank you

Cool place to have some gr8 craft beer the music will surprise youin a very good way Staff are friendlyand finally a variety of one of the best beers in Odessa  a must go to place   And as a graphic designer i love their branding 
Delicious coffee and hot dogs

A very good sports pub to watch a football match  The best one I found while spending a week in Dnipro  They must have around 25 TV screens and appeared to have access to matches from all over Europe  I watched a couple of English Premier League matches while drinking a good range of craft beers  I think they had 810 different beers on tap along with an extensive menu  Friendly guy behind the bar who spoke good English as well
Who is happy Im happy Thank you guys that even with all booked tables you allow me to enjoy this awesome beer Moreover I came from kremenchuk for it Thank you Reccomend
3 stars is in comparison to its past glory  food was tastier croutons were sliced in smaller pieces grass was greener and girls from displays in WC were shocked with size of my weewee
Less people and they stream mostly english clubs matches when there are more than one maches going on during same time even during champions league
Great place with a soul Great choice of whiskeys and few kinds of beer Food is simple and good just as it should be in a pub
Its OK the food is delicious but you have to wait for a long time And you can see cockroaches there sometimes
Perfect place for evening beer and delicious meal  Be careful waitress cheated Shortchanged us for 25
One from the best places to drink beer and whisky in Shop to
Great place to enjoy some cocktails or beers surrounded by an explainable Nestor Makhno theme Fellow costumers are cheerful and even down for a conversation in English The staff seems inexperienced but really do their best and provide service with a smile
Recommend grapefruit cider Nice atmosphere affordable perfect for predrinks 
Came to see a Ramstein cover band My date and I got nice seats above the floor Really enjoyed the show Afterwards we moved to a couch to sit and talk until closing Meat and cheese snack tray was good
It is a great place Locals Concerts in the backstage Nice service and most of the time they also have darke ukrainian beer Lively Not restricted to a single age I lived it I went 3 days in a row and I met fascinatin people
This is a great pub to spend free time with friends The atmosphere in this place is very colorful The pub has a very wide range of beers and snacks at democratic price I want to note that all meals are prepared independently I recommend a visit to this pub But you have to reserved it Also in this pub great music
Really atmospheric place placed in the center easy to find Beer was awesome a little bit louder music than I wanted but cool playlist As a compliment they give a plate of crisp bread with species lovely Fried cheese with jam was delicious just as it should be
Nice staff good service and good Ukrainian Porter and Ail served It is recommended to visit Bottle Bar in  Dnipropetrovsk
Great Pub with the best selection of draft beer and good food The space is very interesting and background music was spot on One of my favourite Pubs in Ukraine so far and I hope to return one day
Only 1 that we got seats on a longplanned evening Reviews on the sites of the city were good The bar was completely empty  BUT1on the steps of the establishment in front of the front door girls especially on  can get killedsteep steps and darkness 2 The menu says a lot but everything we wanted to order was not available  We spent almost 1 hour of time choosing dishes and then every time we hear Not available because there was a banquet there was nothing left  3Choice of tea2 types  black or green  4 The toilet is terrible primitive 1 for MF unhygienic This is the right door  because immediately the left door IS THE KITCHEN  5 It was not possible to pay with a bank card the terminal did not work 6 Ill pay tribute to the waiter who was on that evening on a substitute from another institution  he tried to smooth out ALL the problems  Props to the boy 7 Such a chic location in the city center next to the Reikartz  cozy PUB and all   Change Drunken Deer and I will change my review   Good luck and keep improving Attached are photos of what we got from the entire menu  Medallions Sausages were punished pork and beef but there were chicken   In a salad  like a hard tree it would be better not to add it at all  We called Salad rest of the banquet 
A good place for solitude There were no people at all The kitchen is very slow but not bad Irish music was playing very loudly A good attempt at recreating the atmosphere of a real British pub but still not
Delicious snacks good music
Great atmospheric place Special respect for the music
Very good taste of traditional ukraina beer Very delicius foods on their men On web menu including with English menu I recomended One of bad imagine on the entrence security He make a show to check of body with detector Very disrespectfully and harshly
Great barrestaurantentertainment venue Menu is reasonably priced although its difficult if you book as a group they do not allow you to pay separately for the bill But otherwise good experience  Book early for Friday and Saturday nights tables sell out a week beforehand Subscribe to amyanna YouTube Vlog 
Accordion players who serenaded our table  Huge venue great for special events Pig on the spit served at 9pm But the menu has a great selection so you dont have to wait Great service and fun atmosphere
Good beer Lovely place Feels like its a theatre not restaurant
The place is not great to say the least The interior appears to have been inherited It can be seen that before it was really comfortable here but now there are tattered sofas dont understand whats on the walls The food took over an hour We ordered several dishes including meat pans So the plates were not brought apparently it was the pans that had to be used as plates Glasses were brought under the whiskey The utensils are basically discordant But the dishes taste very even nothing
Everything was delicious Took two stars off for the oversalted fries and for management to take notice We told the waiter about it but there was no response
The service is excellent The beer is delicious Impressions are very positive The chairs on the summer terrace are soft Would I return here again Answer yes
Good atmosphere for watching football delicious food and beer
Huge selection of beer and spirits There is definitely something for every gourmet
Today they made me a mojito without mint lime and in a coffee glass When the bartender was making a cocktail  he wanted to add regular rum  I had to tell me that I needed white When I tried the first sip and grimaced the apparently acquaintances of the bartender who were behind the counter began to laugh and point their fingers at me When asked Why arent the necessary ingredients available the bartender said he added syrup Its outrageous Why do they pour me unknown things for my money Why doesnt the bartender warn you about what hes doing And why are some strange people making fun of me right behind the bar Naturally I didnt drink it and left the cocktail to the bartender and his friends Perhaps the bartender didnt know how to prepare this cocktail but its clear why he didnt say so and why he started adding who knows what to it With such service and level you need to sell pies at the station but its not a fact that instead of a pie with cabbage you will give the client exactly what he ordered
Just a great place I recommend it to everyone  everything is 5 atmosphere service cuisine drinks attentive and pleasant waiters I havent had such pleasure from a cafe for a long time We got there by accident yesterday December 31st now I personally will be a regular customer Thank you very much for being you and for your wonderful attitude
The interior is good beer is not to everyones taste
Very smoky hookahs pleasant atmosphere fast service and delicious food and this season they also created a summer area a very positive establishment 
The best hookah bar in the city of Dnepr
The best hookah bar in the city

The facade and interior of the establishment is a plus it is clear that they put their soul into it but the interior ends on the way to the WC the corridor in which it smells of kitchen drinks are set in packs is visible behind the scenes of this establishment and it is not in the best shape the WC itself instead of toilet paper  napkins an unpleasant smell the soap dispenser is leaking cosmetic repairs are needed in some places Hall interestingly decorated a lot of interior details but the tablecloths on the tables are not ironed there are stains on the sofas the door to the street is open and all the road dust flies into the hall the M1 channel is on that is there is no feeling of atmosphere and comfort Menu prices like in a restaurant serving like in a bistro decoration with dill taste like in a food court For example the cost of borscht is 76 hryvnias they dont serve donuts or bacon with garlic and horseradish just borscht Service a waiter in uniform but without the mood and desire to smile discreetly brought carried away is called The pricing for such an establishment remains a mystery and why the concept of the interior does not coincide with the kitchen cleanliness and service at all
A very tasty light lunch Cozy atmosphere I was especially pleased with the photos of my favorite actors Polite staff There will be something to tell my Greek relatives I came to visit friends in Ukraine
The idea is good but the execution is 3 The interior toilet dishes do not correspond to the restaurant category The level of service is even deeper minus  its better to remain silent about the food Thank you but no
Great bar We need more places like this And then these clubs and restaurants are already fed up with the order The bartender doesnt make you wait for your drink Everything is fast and clear





Ok Could be better
Good food
Great view
Only positive emotions Having come once its impossible to forget I want to come again and again
Does not work



The food is very tasty hookahs are the best in Donetsk
it will do but when there are a lot of hookah smokers you cant breathe
The Dj created a brilliant atmosphere that is not found anywhere else in the city
In general its not even bad for Donetsk
Normal
A pleasant and cozy place for evening gatherings with groups of friends When fully planted it is a bit noisy I like the place because despite the fact that our table is taken by one waiter but while he is busy any of the waiters can take the order and even go and clean the table without asking There are quite a lot of appetizers on the menu but I would like to add some desserts
Great place nice staff cozy rooms The menu is not large but interesting There are no frills here  this is a pub There are no desserts on the menu but if you ask the waiters  that is There is also a smoking room with hookahs Have been several times and everything is top notch The dishes are delicious they took salting from veal from silver carp baked potatoes set Fry and set Full raskolbas  I liked it very much One minus  the coffee is not tasty 
Visited this place with a large group  From the pros  1 Convenient location Literally 30 seconds walk from a public transport stop  2 There is a summer playground although I would recommend sitting indoors as the great design and atmosphere will make your evening much better  3 Inside is spacious and plenty of space Despite the fact that the institution serves hookahs the smell from them is practically not felt  4 Clean and very comfortable toilet Good odor suppression the presence of paper towels and liquid soap there are special shelves for phones in the booths The lids of the trash cans are equipped with motion sensors and open without contact  5 Polite administrator and waiters Without problems they issue a separate account exchange cash and give change Paying by card is no problem either  6 There is a separate cigar room for lovers of good tobacco  7 Bluela is served quickly The taste of the dishes is beyond praise Beer is tasty and fresh properly bottled  From controversial points  1 The institution aykos friendly and it serves hookahs At the same time I did not notice a separate area for nonsmokers  2 The institution itself with the exception of the summer playground is located on the basement floor or rather in the basement To get to it you need to go down the stairs Therefore companies with sedentary citizens should consider this problem in advance  In addition to the above points I did not notice frank minuses  For lovers of pubs and atmospheric establishments I definitely recommend it
A small cozy sports bar for fans and beer loversThe bar has only 5 tables and 3 plasma TVs there was no redneck activity just what you need for a quiet and relaxing viewing of the matches
The beer is delicious and fresh True after football there were problems with snacks They promised to fix it by the next day
Not a bad place to have a beer Nice atmosphere inside
Good fresh beer an assortment of beers and most importantly an excellent topping up in a bottleglass the first time Ive seen this
Great beer set crowdy but cozy place somehow
The place is for beer lovers only They offer really good variety one of the best in the city of craft beers Place is almost loft Its not really good designed for quality time with a group of friends more just for drinking beers in small company of 1 or 2 or take away Recommend
Very pleasant barstaff Beer cheap enough Brilliant experience
Very good beer  love you guys thank you for everything
Nice place quite small but cozy Every FridaySaturday eve life jazz from 10pm   Interesting drinks recipies Sure accept cards
The best cocktails ever This place is hard to find but its definitely worth it
Perfect place for the evening with friends and alco Significantly attentive staff who are real good in a pro way But a bit pricy at the end
Top level drinks best bar un town for sure  guys work with passion and servis excellent
Great food and drinks Best place to meet or celebrate in ZP with family and friends
Great pub with a good food and a big selection of beer
Meat really delicious And good place
Good restaurant and grill
Food was absolutely amazing but slightly pricey for the Ukraine  Cool atmosphere and good drink selection Worth checking out if not on a strict budget
This a great place to have a drink Good menu tasty dishes I love to spend time with my friends here Great stuff Highly recommend this place
Awesome pub Good atmosphere music service is great The beer is fantastic the burger is to die for honestly the bacon and patty the fresh veggies Its perfect Waiters can speak English decently enough to understand the menu and what you want You just earned a new regular
Food quality makes it 3 or maybe 4 the location ambience and service are really so good that they earn the last stars from me my brother and I had a blast here by playing a game We set a rule that we had to quote Churchill before or during every order or had to buy the round the staff got a kick out of it and had a blast with us Great crew that are willing to have fun If you are fun and willing to have some then this is a place to go
We had an unpleasant experience Unfortunate the servers were slow and for some reason that nobody explained us our food came 32min after we got a drinks It was not a busy night also the table near us experienced the same delay with their food and bill When we were leaving server didnt apologize and provided 5 discount what is very disappointing Adding the bill to the photos Want to mention that food and drinks were great
Tasty beer lovers should try
Good food superior waiter and cozy atmosphere Prices higher than middle but it worth
It was perfect I like this restaurant In this place is old traditions like in Kumpel Tested bear food The atmosphere was cool cozy Personal was very polite and professional
Tasty Beers Tasty Pizzas Friendly servers We look forward to going back and enjoying ourselves You should definitely check it out Large beer selections and for you Americans out there the best ranch dressing Ive had in Ukraine
Mixed feelings Its not possible to make an order at the bar Ill never understand it You need to sit down and deal with waitresses Its a bit too hipsta Beer is good Pizza is fine but not my kind
This place is great and has an awesome atmosphere But it is always about details Regarding bathrooms they have 3 spots for males and only 1 for females So as a girl expect drinking beer for 20 mins and then spend 40 mins in a line for that single restroom I mean not 1 to 3 but 3 to 1 Really
good beer selection tasty food 
Their home made beers are really good Tastes like peanut in it to me  and their foods are really delicious Especially pork specialities It is a crowded place and to have a place outside is nearly impossible in the evenings But they have an underground salloon and it also has a good atmosphere Strongly recommended
Its nice place with decent beers and meals Be prepare to wait for the table if you didnt make reservation earlier Not sure why this place is so popular Soup was a bit too salty steak was good but not cooked as requested
We came here for breakfast I can say that it was a mistake cause the place is definitely overrated  I dont believe that their chef can cook anything if he cant even properly cook scrambled eggs After all there was a mosquito on the toast which would be a good finding in a piece of amber not on the plate see pictures attached
Their menu is something incredible They have so many different dishes to choose between that it wont be enough coming there for 5 days in a row If youre visiting lviv for the first time or if you want to try a really good place  you must take a visit in this restaurant
Great place to visit and repeat it always Tasty food amazing beer and services
The cuisine was very disappointing Salads and main dishes are offered in sets of 3 small portions When I asked to bring me one salad in a large size for the full price the waiter said that it is not possible although in the menu was indicated that you could choose one for the full price As a result I ordered a dish with tender meat which was impossible to chew at all the meat turned out to be cold with hot grilled vegetables Beer seems to be not bad but friends complained that their head hurt in two hours The whole impression is not the best its not the cheapest place and I definitely wont go there anymore Of the advantages one can note the beautiful design and polite friendly staff
Really good Mosaic and other craft beer but portions are very small You would need at least 2 meals However really good design and music that compose a great atmosphere Definitely recommended for a companies Friendly personnel Also really nice proposals for a lunch
Best location in area Nice food and staff
Very good resto to hang out But little bit slow
It was very crowded on Saturday at midnight we had to reserve a table for 5 persons Both cocktails and food were delicious
Name may be a bit misleading Its more of a club with really tiny dancefloor Much too loud for conversations Location and no entrance fee is definitely the best thing about it you can just check it out and leave if you dont dig it
This is an awesome place Drinks are soooo good no really Just come and check it Prices are fair but if compare prices and quality of drinks with other places around  this place is a te real win
Have asked about IPA got totally different beer The girl was rude and said she just forgot Keep your staff competent
Awesome beer sets They have board games to play as well I suggest you take a few rounds of Jenga while drinking beer with your lads its a lot of fun
Good place nice food
A neat little pub we stopped at for a beer Many bilingual people in area
All is Good and food is perfect We came at 5am but if Youre Open it does not mean that You can move all the tables with such dusturbing loudness We felt Like we ate our food in center of cleaning time Good prices Smiling staff
Have been here many times before But if that is a potato with microscopic ham in it Probably the inflation hit Lviv more The same chain in Dinipro or Kharkiv was serving much much bettet good I will not come here again
Happy place with only 4 kinds of beer but with lots of other alcoholic drinks Fun entertainment waits for you in the evening and 18 show is worth to be seen
Super nice atmosphere fulfilled by Ukrainian songs and great Ukrainian food People can sing in teams on the scene dance on the chairs and tables
Good beer not the biggest selection compared to other pubs Cool atmosphere to watch football matches as the place is decorated in such way
I cant set for certain why I am drawn to this pub Perhaps it is the flawless English of the owner Andrey as well as his welcoming manner In any case this is a terrific spot especially for sports fans Full of paraphernalia especially of the local Carpaty football team a big screen always featuring the game cozy atmosphere and a jovial crowd  Stop in for a pint and some good eats youll be coming back again and again
Amazing Atmosphere especially on game day Must visit if you are man utd fan
The place is almost in old town of Lviv city center Nice food not high prices and friendly personnel Good choice of beer Nice place to watch a football match with your friends Fans f Manchester United would really like this place
Great food quality
The food is really tasty But while you wait for the waiter you will simply die of hunger the staff sits in the middle without even looking at the terrace and this is on a permanent basis Today they came for dinner again and after waiting for 17 minutes they just couldnt stand it turned around and left PS Only 2 tables were occupied and there were at least 2 waiters on shift  I ask the institutions administration to pay attention to this and take measures
The food is good the potatoes are tasty I like the impression that I am dining in the Carpathians
Great facility Delicious food and friendly staff I recommend
Very nice service and very nice place So delicious guacamole
Terribly There is nothing from the desserts the hoods do not work hookah lovers also need to take a breath of fresh air 3 points for the service and this is for the girl because she is just polite I do not recommend To the question of the hood I was answered it does not charge I never wrote comments it just brought me out
I came with my parents on vacation to smoke a hookah and try cocktails and we were very satisfied with the atmosphere service hookah and cocktails in particular which is important to me since I myself work in this industry well done to the bartender I would also like to mention Yulia she added good emotions before the visit Everything was great This is one of the best establishments in Lviv I highly recommend it 
A chic establishment with a modern fresh interior for lovers of lounge bars and delicious food At the entrance to the restaurant you immediately see a photo area with a swing Then you can choose the first or second floor The establishment plays pleasant music has an experienced hookah man and a very friendly administrator There are no questions about the food the tartar is very tasty The cocktails are also very beautifully presented and delicious Prices are reasonable Definitely worth a visit
Nice location and service Very good drinks
 owners are just sick Ive just noticed they DMed me photos from a   with me and my friends sitting in the bar  telling they cant see the reason for the bad review Well I extended it bellow and it is now one star instead of initial two  Cocktails were just usual and too expensive for this quality Me and my friends ordered 4 different cocktails I tried each one and was really disappointed I can order similar in any pizza place for the half price  Also stuff didnt let us move 2 chairs to sit at the table so we had to sit at the bar Just a few minutes later other visitors just moved the chairs to the exact same table we initially wanted  Moreover glasses are cheap and are unpleasant to drink from comparing to other cocktail places near eg Baczewski Restaurant Sous Kafe with the similar prices  Do not recommend this place for cocktails
Nice little spot Main floor is a hallway where the restrooms are and then you go down the basement where theres is a couple of handful of tables and a bar Friendly staff and good drinks
The interior is a bit poor but cocktails are great Service was on a good level however sometimes you dont feel this personal touch I would definitely come here again in case of all other relevant places are busy
Great establishment Atmospheric pub albeit with terrible music cool interior cozy tables and polite staff Pleased with the prices but upset the burgers For 85 UAH they brought us a medium burger with french fries pickles and fresh vegetable salad Everything looked amazing but the burger is a complete disappointment It feels like they bought it in a stall at the station and just warmed it up Obviously not fresh heated chicken inappropriate mushrooms which by the way are not mentioned on the menu tomato not fresh bun and kichinese Because of the advantage I go here again try something else but the burgers here are a complete fiasco bro
Oh how I liked and sunk into the soul of this place The girl greets you cordially with a smile immediately right at home We didnt order much but we ate well we also liked the beer very much Prices do not bite the food is delicious the service is a bomb the interior is original but cool To go to the toilet of course it was a little unusual you need to take a card from the girl at the bar since the door can only be opened with the help of such a card And such a picture was observed One person went to the toilet naturally took the card and the second one followed so when the first one came out and left with the card the second one remained blocked in the restroom So look But the place is really very good I advise And Ill be back to you 
Accidentally got into this institution Very friendly staff Menu with photos of dishes Prices are moderate The dishes were prepared delicious so quickly Special thanks to the waitress Liza for her attentiveness tact and friendliness I recommend
Great place with its own atmosphere nice service and a wonderful place The girl at the entrance has a wonderful smile and welcome The varieties are delicious its a pity there is only one variety from craft I recommend
I didnt expect this level of service the prices are great
Very beautiful


Delightful drink
An interesting nivaika in the style of they dont sit here Im indifferent to alcohol got into it by accident I was pleased with the format I have not seen similar places in the Kyrgyz Republic I thought it was in the spirit of an ordinary cafe you sit and eat and drink I took a sip of the drink it didnt seem bad
It is very cool that the drunken cherry appeared in Kryvyi Rih Very cool establishment service at the level very tasty liqueur   A piece of Lviv  I recommend
If you want to have a good rest come here Great and tasty drink and lots of smiles and quality service It is possible to sing and have positive emotions
Absolutely delicious hamburger sauce is perfect meat was wonderful It was messy but worth it Perfect amount of fries for a nottooheavy lunch Definitely will be back
Enjoyed a great meal last night with my beautiful Lena food was very good service was great too Great quiet atmosphere with good music too We will come again highly recommended
Very tasty tarts A little sad that the service is not in Ukrainian language
Good ambience and great place for meeting fine dining or even working in peace and tranquility Selection of food and drinks is good in addition to be reasonably priced


Glory to Ukraine Glory to heroes Such a greeting would be good for your waiters and bartenders to know Today we visited pubdoping to have a drink and unfortunately we were disappointed We cannot recommend your establishment The first drawback is the undersalted dish the potatoes in the pan with mushrooms were not salty at all the second  the table was cleared on time I had to call the waiter the third  I had to wait a long time for the check with the payment and when I approached the bar counter and asked they tried to give me a check in hands instead of being given at the table as it should be Most likely due to the fact that we pointed out a shortcoming that we noticed when ordering songs The song Oh the red viburnum in the meadow was cut only the chorus although there are also verses in it Money was paid for a full song We were told that complaints are only to the management So dear management of SportPubDoping I ask you to take this shortcoming into account and to work out the above issues with your staff Thank you in advance Good Bye
The place is highly recommended The food is tasty highquality prepared and served quickly Cool interior with paintings and advertising photos of sports competitions of the beginning of the 20th century A large section of the wall is dedicated to Olga Harlan there is even her original tunic with the inscription KHARLAN UKR on the back Shots please with originality and price There is a hookah
A good place Smoke hookah Nice staff Easy and relaxed atmosphere I recommend To relax with friends what you need Affordable prices By the way we need a waiter ka The place is very good No frills everything is exactly as it should be
One of the best APA
Great beer
Good
Im just delighted We dont have such a great selection of beer anywhere else For every taste different completely exclusive varieties You can try it and enjoy the interesting atmosphere you can take it home you can even bring your own snack In general I am a fan Everything is done with great professionalism imagination and immeasurable love


I like this place its pretty quiet they have a great service really nice people work here I do recommend this place to visit They have a special menu beer create by themselves The minus of the menu  its pretty hard to read cause its just a photos of the paper menu in the Google docs But in other case its just one minus When Ive ordered the latte Ive got it in the beer glass it was funny  You can order table by phone call its convenient as I mentioned before the people who work here really nice and professional I have been enjoyed to visit this place 
Very nice atmosphere Good food Excellent cocktails Nice staff Came to the pool side in the morning at 11am when it opens enjoyed tanning on the sunbeds until lots of children came and started jumping and splashing in the pool Overall very nice place
A great place to relax and enjoy food drinks friends and scenery It is called an Irish bar but Im not sure why The food and drinks are well priced and the seating is comfortable Our waiter spoke decent English and they have an English menu on request Service is attentive without being pushy or making you feel rushed There is a pool belonging to the hotel next door that you can swim in for a nominal fee and they provide a towel It gets a little windy in the afternoon but in hot days it feels particularly refreshing
Cozy place with yummy food They have lots of different alcohol Ive tried the Ruby one which suddenly tasked like a beer The place has a nice view It looks beautiful on the evenings
Good barbecue  good hookah good beer good service  good location on the street Food and drink a little pricey hookah normal
Tasty steak good service live music can be too loud as usual in Ukraine
Good place awesome hooka and live music
Good location good staff enjoyable
Very tasty excellent beer
Good portion of food decent prices for Zurich variety on beers I liked the cherry cider too at 6 chf
Amazing beef guiness pie Tasty fish burger Good beer on tap
Really friendly bartenders good beer selection pretty good food Around 16 beer taps of which 6 are sadly dedicated to plain old Guinness Burgers wraps pub fare We had a great time and the bartenders were very helpful Zurich pricing I guess thats inevitable
Great atmosphere  close to a larger chain pub in the UK but expensive for a pub Nice to have in Zurich to remind of home Food was good not great Staff were lovely Pub quiz is CROWDED but the MC is entertaining and does his best to get the crowd into the mood
The food was so good especially the burger The atmosphere was so cool and worm
Nice little niche of Ireland in Willishofen Run by expats you get most of the plus  generous portions good burgers nostalgia beers  and none of the disadvantages this place is spotless clean
Cant come without ordering some onion rings  the best ones so far and the chicken wings  top Nice friendly and helpful guys working there Good place to be 
Nice Irish pub which also has an external terrace Good beer selection and typical menu TV scattered around for watching sports Of course English is the language of choice
Great establishment and the food was incredible The onion rings as a starter were crispy and flavorful The fish and chips were awesome Lots of flaky fish and reasonable amount of fries served as it should have been with malt vinegar We also had an order of veal schnitzel which was pounded flat and fried crispy Also quite delicious The bartender brought us some nice double espresso for dessert We had plum crumb and a chocolate lava cake for dessert which were out of this world Drinks were flowing with beer and club soda and otherwise a very delightful evening Our waiter and bartender were very friendly and struck up an awesome conversation after dinner Definitely a place to come and enjoy 
Very elegant Irish pub with a great atmosphere and attentive service
Upscale pub in Zurich with friendly service nice ambiance and a tasty house grappa distilled from plumbs My only gripe is that the draft beer was a few degrees warmer than I prefer although this seems to be the norm in Switzerland Overall a top notch place
It was quite different from my previous experience maybe because it was in noon Its more a restaurant with a bar attached than an informal setting Its good to hang out after work if your office is nearby or else it doesnt make sense to visit by travelling or changing connections
Bartender took her time pouring the perfect beer My friend had the fish  chips and said it was the best he had Atmosphere is great inside
We ran into this place as we were exploring Old Town Zrich We met Andrew from Columbus OH who told us that it was Zurichs oldest expat pub We fell in love with the place immediately Great selection of beers and the vibe is of an old English style pub They were doing trivia that night as well We will definitely be back
Great atmosphere and crowd Was able to watch NFL games including my Green Bay Packers Great food and beer I highly recommend
Ive been traveling throughout Europe for a month and spent nearly two weeks in the UK and the fish  chips here are the best Ive ever had Amazing flavor crunchy but tender and absolutely delicious And the bloke running the place was so friendly and welcoming I couldnt be happier Thank you for an awesome experience
Walking around the city of Zurich I came across this venue Decorated with Halloween trimming I had a pint of Guinness and a double burger with fries The girl on the bar with the English accent who happens to be Swiss was charming
Right in the centre of Zurich this place has an amazing vibe Visited the place in the evening and I would definitely recommend it for a night out A great tribute to Lord Horatio Nelson which is  generally regarded as the greatest officer in the history of the Royal Navy His reputation is based on a series of remarkable victories culminating in the Battle of Trafalgar where he was killed in his moment of triumph
Good location in the heart of the city Lot of place  nice selection of beers Quite dark and not so much ambiance Quite expensive for what it is
If youre missing English beer this place is great they also have bitter which is unusual here However they ruin the atmosphere with loud techno music before 8pm They havent looked at who is their audience on a Thursday or Friday evening most of which are older and want to hear themselves talk and not be bombarded with loud music so early in the evening Outside seating was already taken  we left to go next door to the roof top which was more pleasant
Despite the late time for lunch kitchen was closed Ahmad was so nice and kind to welcome us with some delicious chicken wings and fries He covered all our needs with a super attention greatly appreciated Definitely a place to try if youre in town
Big Ben is actually a nice bar in the middle of Zurich Selection of beers is good however there was no kitchen on a Saturday evening Good for a quick beer and watching a match though
Rude and racist bar wish could give it a zero stars review My friends and I visited it around midnight to grab drinks there were barely any people in the bar After some time when I asked for water the lady at the bar seemed annoyed and frowned while handing me a glass of water When a few more of us asked for water the lady and the other bartender told us that the pub is closed while they continued serving other mostly caucasian customers We told them we will pay them for the water they pretended they arent listening to us while gladly serving other customers We left the bar surprised and shocked at this blatant racist behavior
Lets face it Its the best place in all of Zurich Best whisky best beer no run of the mill best cigars and tobacco products best location best ever atmosphere and then theres the one defining element which is Egon A home and not one away from home An actual home Make this your living room away from everything daunting Great music all year round and about a million screens with all the sports imaginable This you wont find anywhere else Tradition local and pure class The locals shape this place
Too many drunk people Sometimes they fight sometimes they dont Outside sitting is better than inside
Perfect for an afterwork beer duringthe week  Never been on weekends but I guess atmosphere must be even better  Nice music been played on the background when I visited it  Several screens around the place playing sports and two darts machine  Toilets are clean not smelly and well serviced  Smokers welcome They have a dedicated closed by glass area inside the bar
The food and service was amazing  The bartender spoke English German Dutch and French The pad Thai was the best Great food  drink selections
15 minutes to be attended the waitress that finally saw me  was interrupted by her college before we could order the second drinks After another 5 minutesfinally we ordered two cocktails Lets call them that like they have in there drink list AWFUL PURE ALCOHOL  Not only the cocktail were dreadful the preparation  the decoration  It look like a work from some 10 year old   I payed 49 CHF for two cocktails that from my professional perspective are not even worthy  My best recommendation to the owner TAKE AWAY THE COCKTAILS IMMEDIATELY  I would never order a cocktail hereeven if they played me  SERVICE ZERO QUALITY ZERO  Ive been in other Nelson bars This was an embarrassment for the brand
The Pub Quiz on Mondays is a super fun event and weve been attending regularly  Their reservation organization is not great though Its happened to us multiple times where weve booked online doublecheckedconfirmed over the phone because we were worried that it hadnt gone through only to arrive and for them to tell us that there was no table for us  Its a great place and the staff are super friendly but they should really improve their reservation process
My first pub when visiting Switzerland for the first time and it was a nice experience The 2 bartenders from Bulgaria and from Slovakia were super friendly and upbeat Thank you
No one to serve at the table In a friday afternoon almost empty  No Pub vibe I was there 2 times before before Pandemie and the vibe was way better I hope they can return to their glory days
I took a group of friends to Coopers last week to celebrate a birthday I dont often leave reviews but we had such a good time and the staff were such legends that I felt I had to  The atmosphere was really friendly the Flammkuchen was delicious and there was also great live music bingo and karaoke which kept us all entertained We will definitely be back again
I gave a second chance to this restaurant after a disappointing cheeseburger I order the buffalo wings that were a total disaster Over fried no taste nor seasoning ridiculous size of wings The picture speaks by itself It has nothing to do with Buffalo wings After giving the feedback to the waiter he came back and said that it is how it should be Just avoid this place
This is a great pub on the west side of Zurich  Ahmad and his crew are the best  Fantastic food and sports on TV Service is top notch  highly recommend if in the area
Great hangout The service staff are super friendly and helpful Special thanks to our server missed her name and Ahmad who went out of their way to get us the french fries long after the kitchen was closed 
Went because it was close to my hotel Ordered a few drinks which were fine What was not fine was asking for two tap waters and being charged 2 CFH each U225 A tad petty
Unbelievably small food portions Dont eat here unless on a diet Steak Pie ie mini Pukka pie took 30 plus minutes to defrost fish and chips only has one small piece of fish and a thimble of mushy peas Good for sports though just plan for a pre or post visit kebab
Great vibe  Fish and chips were excellent  Watched a rugby game with locals Big fun
After a few hours of exploring Old Town Zurich we stopped here for the beginning of our pub crawl  This was stop number one  The decor is tastefully done and not gaudy  They had a good selection of beer on tap  There is a snug overlooking a brasserie  They have outdoor seating too  I ordered a Moscow mule which even came in a proper copper mug  There was a food menu but we only came from drinks  A family with kids and strollers sat near us and ordered food so its good for kids too
Nice pub which serves decent prized beer and shows sports from their multiple tvs They even had access to the channel showing the ice hockey world championship 2023 which isnt too popular in Swiss pubs Went there many times and would definitely go again too
Awesome place to go out alone or get together with friends and enjoy some delicious fresh cocktails Cozy place with great staff amazing personalities Weekends great live DJs without being charged for entrance   Love it Can just recommend 
We had a great time we were on the rooftop at the beginning of the evening had some food special attention to the burgers including a veggie one and also had some shisha The decor was very pretty although in the middle of the city it was kind of a secluded rooftop almost forgot we were in Zurich Very nice Later went down to the bar and had a lot of fun The ladies working on the rooftop were very nice and playful The bartenders down in the bar were very funny and nice too If we come around Zurich again we will definetly coming back Thank you
Great chicken wings and fabulous cheese Raclette We thoroughly enjoyed that evening in the rooftop terrace Great service and marvellous Guinness
Very nice place close to the mainstation to spend good times The staff is very jolly and energetic something that Zrich definitely needs more  If you want to have a nice drink in the heart of Zrich I recommend Lady Hamiltons
Very bad experience with the waitress very rude I dont reccomand
Waiting for the microphone one hour And the bodyguard took it away from our hands and said that its close but after give it for another girl At the end I said its not fear and he just kick me out
Righi after entering they forced us to get a Drink well okay if that is their policy  After two beers and a RumColawhich were meh I asked for a tap wather and they just said no In every place in Zurich it is used to get TapWater for free  Very disapointing and rude staff
One of the best karaoke places that I know Only issue I had with them is that the DJ would push certain songs up the queue for some for a price But now they have a new DJ who thankfully doesnt do that Im happy to wait my turn and Im glad they addressed the issue
They sell laced weed to u never pickup from this bar its spice
Could be better and more organized
                
Yesterday there was not as good service as its used to be Pitty
Great location wide variety in local and international beers laidback atmosphere pleasant people charismatic barkeeper and owner
Overall a nice and friendly Pub Good selection of beers but nothing special
Fair prices and great atmosphere The best part is board games night every Tuesday from 1930 Fantastic people and nice ambience 
Incredible place with warm atmosphere with very hot barmen 
I went there on a saturday evening they had karaoke playing Half of the songs were early 2000s classics but the other half were terrible and not many people knew them The bar also has a weird atmosphere not very cosy but definitely not fancy either The people there were all rather old The prices are way too high
Wow What can I say I came over the pond from the USA for a Krokus concert and they made me feel right at home Love u guys THX
Their staff were really rude and aggressive The game machine took my money I asked them to help me they said yeah the machine is broken Very disappointing I wont go there anymore
Decent bar they have TV  screens so they play the games But The shots are too expensive and theres no draft beer
Warm friendly pub Theres a variety of seating from a meandering bar to cocktail tables to corner booths for quiet conversation I appreciated the interesting nautical theme and artifacts Staff are welcoming and friendly and the beverage choices suited to various tastes including local beers on tap some treats for expats and a good selection of liquors
Very nice waiterswaitress good Service 
Nice casual spot to grab a drink with friends The staff are lovely people and there is a cool terrace open during summer The only downside is that the indoor space for nonsmokers is quite small but there is a large indoor room for smokers The drink pricing is great compared to Zrich
Very good atmosphere and wonderful garden like bar Serving delicious cocktails and bbq sausages A bit pricey but definitely worth an evening there
Excellent pub with a really nice selection of beers on tap They usually have my favourite Wiehanstephaner Weissbier from Bavaria The staff are very polite courteous and prompt One of my favourites in Zurich with reality good food I love the nachos here Ice heard very nice reviews of the Ramen from my friends 5 stars
We went on a Wednesday a group of 10 The atmosphere is great for groups with long tables and wide rooms The team is kind and witty They were professionals and good timings I had the cheeseburger with coleslaw salad which was not bad
Great staff Pork Ramen noodles were fabulous Nice noodles in perfectly seasoned chicken broth with fresh veggies and pork Delicious and quick Not a huge amount of seats available at lunch Go early Good selections of nontraditional choices of beer and Ales Good porter and stout in bottles Yum
In general great as usual except one thing The bar has a policy of no own food while food serving stops at 2145 We were kicked out when we came at 2200 learned that there is no food serving and brought a pizza with us Wed recommend to make the no own food policy in action only during food serving hours Otherwise it makes the bar attending after 2200 very uncomfortable
One of few places that was open till late so we could enjoy our drinks for a bit longer Nice atmosphere and friendly staff
great place great atmospher great drinks great service
Comfortable
Great place very nice to work with Ill definitely come back
Tasty burgers and great mood in the bar Definitely recommend Great selection of beers  Wish the french fries portion was bigger with the burger  Was very happy with the focaccia as well
Very cool vibe in this pub in old town  Good beers and a great night of comedy as well
Great food and very reasonable prices for Switzerland However despite not being very busy service was a bit on the slow side
Great place for sport events Service is incredible and food is great Juliet is an amazing host
Ally delivers on the true Irish Pub hospitality a home away from home I cannot recommend this place enough
Awful manner We were a group of 10 archi students having an excursion in Geneva and we came across this cozy Irish bar At first everything went well until we were about to leave that the bartender raged us pay 20CHF more since the machine said we ordered two more drinks We checked everyones bank accounts and transaction histories and we were sure that we only paid for 10 drinks one per each person We showed the bartender our transaction history but in return he said pay the 10 FHR and youll be fine to leave Geneva This was holy awful and no one else in the bar tried to help us We had an Irish classmate with us and she realised that the bartender could be actually American giving us a more skeptical impression to this tragic place We felt being criticised with a harsh attitude even when we paid for 10 beers and expressed our gratitude with our halfFrench language skills  I hope the machine could get fixed and the bartender could be more generous and openminded when it comes to problemsolving
I was only there for about 45 minutes but it made a great impression on me and Ill make sure to stop by the next time Im in town  My friend and I were going back to the hotel after dinner and stopped in for a drink It was busy but we still found two seats The bartender Ally was amazing she was very friendly and made us feel welcome There was a band playing and the atmosphere was everything I would hope for in an Irish pub
A small cosy place Relatively quiet even on weekends this is a great place to drink some good Irish beer while having a fun conversation with a good friend  the decorations are unique enough to mention as well
Really tasty chicken and bacon club sandwich just quite pricey Staff were attentive and friendly it was pretty pricey though Slightly disappointing also that we did not ask for fries but got given fries and did not realise that was an extra charge on top of the sandwiches themselves This may have been a language issue though since we arent from here
Great atmosphere to have a drink and watch games Staff friendly and approachable
Went to this place on one of the hottest days because they had AC Wasnt super cool in there but was enough to take the edge off of the 100 degree day  Fish from the fish and chips was excellent Club sandwich was good except the chicken was a little dry from overlooking
Had a great time here today with my family It was our first time eating at Grand Duke and the fish  chips and the club sandwich were all amazing We split a pitcher of beer as well The waiter was great and he even gave us a round of lemon drop shots on the way out I highly recommend
The food was amazing and nice pub as well
The hamburger was big and tasty and my chicken sandwich was really good too The chips were crunchy and delicious I dont drink beer but my husband said that his beer was really good too he drunk a hoegaarden
Stopped here for a drink the atmosphere was so nice and chilled that we stayed for food Nice seating outside lots of seating inside Beer prices average food was a tad cheaper that some other places Food was hot tasty well presented with a good portion In a good location
Staff very friendly helpful and nice food lovely and I was surprised they were serving at 1130pm Excellent service
this place was a cool bar to chillout and watch sports before i walked over to UN HQ i visited as a tourist in April 2023 The bartender from Lithuania was very kind to me and told me areas of interest along Geneva lake for my bike ride would definitely return go GenveServette HC  
Great place for a beer with friends Lots of fun events The best place to watch sports with big screens and great atmosphere
Visited thus pub on a Sunday load of tvs all showing different sports plenty of seating very to close to downtown  amazing food aswell
Good place to drink and watch the football Many screens and happy to change to suit viewers One of the only places we could find open to watch the football on a Sunday Reasonably priced
Good little barpub Friendly staff
Id love the place to relax after a hard day of  work
What a mega pub Son and I visited Geneva for a few days and found this pub We thought it would be a great place to ask about places to visit and trips out etc Great reception when we walked in Mark the barman was so welcoming and helpful we soon had plenty of information The pizzas are definitely some of the best Ive eaten The atmosphere in the bar is great helped along by Mark who has a great rapport with the locals and strangers a like we visited on several occasions and celebrated St Patricks day in the Crowned Eagle Got back to our hotel at 2am No hesitation in recommending this bar I will be going back later in the year Make sure you ask if Mark is working
Was in Geneva for only two days found the place first day luckily Good pub nice and friendly crew working there Felt home at once came the second day too If you like pubs this is good
Good price drinks and outstanding food
Britannia Fish  Chips Perch Fillets Shrimp tails in breadcrumbs and fried calamari Instead of the classic fish and chips which they serve here also I went for the mixed version in this English Pub that has a range of beers on tap  Good place to be if there is a live footballl match going on too
Very relaxed ambience The prices are reasonable and the bartenders are friendly The beer selection menu is displayed at a convenient location There are some big tables which might fit around a group of 15 They have some good selection of spirits Be sure to ask them if you have something in mind
I arrived in Geneva after a difficult two weeks and was greeted by the Britannia not 1 minute after walking out the train station  1L beer friendly staff who made such an effort to speak English as my French is basic at best great atmosphere and without a doubt one  if not  the best burgers i have ever had I dont know if it was the beer my exhaustion or the burger itself but wow wow wow People were watching me enjoy the heck out of this burger I couldnt care less What a way to start my travelling journey through Europe  5 stars because 8 isnt an option
Had rather 2 basic looking cocktails served in normal basic glasses at PREMIUM pricing 43 big bucks  couldnt believe my eyes for a moment Especially considering how the overall vibe and atmosphere suggests something otherwise more chill and rather cheap The billiards table and darts on offer is great which youll still have to pay for btw  but yet again just doesnt line up very well with some of the pricing here Otherwise its still a good time to be had
Friendly service music good atmosphere 30CHF for a gin and a beer doesnt put it in the cheap category however
Great place to watch football I wished the sound from the football match could be louder to create a better atmosphere Pool and darts also available here to be played
Pricey for a standard pub even for Geneva and despite having lots of TV screens unable to put the Premier League on Only 1 out of the 5 screens was turned on
Really nice location the lady who works in the morning made me an incredible mixed plancha of meat and cheese I have felt very welcome here every time that I have visited
Great place Warm welcome from the owner and joking makes it the perfect choice for chilling in the evening
The exterior area around Charlys Pub is recently renovated and very nice with an open square and fountain Cherlys is the same excellent pub that it has always been Good beer and lots of variety and of course all the different other goodies that you would expect My French is almost nonexistent but thankfully the folks at Charlys also have good English And while Charlys has good eats if you really want a great lunch or dinner go to Magnum Kebab just a few meters away and chow down with the best kebab in Saint GenisPouilly
Pretty decent place for a drink
Not for everyone but perfect for those who miss Thai food or miss the fun karaoke atmosphere or both  If you are familiar with Thai food you can request for dishes outside the menu and make special requests eg how spicy do you want the food to be how well done do you want your fried eggs to be and etc We went as a group of Thai tourists and found that all the dishes we ordered upon special requests were very flavorful and impressive made one feels like going back home However the dishes on the menu was rather bland especially the Pad Thai If you know how good Pad Thai is supposed to taste I strongly recommend you to avoid ordering it here You will be disappointed for sure  What I really like about this place though is its attentive services and lively atmosphere You can find people singing songs in many languages Thai English French and so on Many of them are such talented singers And well though some were far from being the best singers you can feel the joy from them having fun and reliving stress And who knows you might discover a new favourite song from this pub  To sum up if you are going there for the food go there in the early evening and request that the taste is made to be for Thai people But if you are there for the fun karaoke atmosphere go in late evening and enjoy
Thais pub Everyone can ask to sing any songs especially Thai songs Bar tender is very friendly Food tasted original
Great atmosphere but very crowded in the evenings In order to sing your song you will need to wait more than an hour in the rush hours But if you come a bit earlier in the evening around 2000  its a bit better
ive been here quite a few times simply put its pretty amazing alas i can see why someone might not like it it depends on the personal opinion of each and one of you  but heres some info anyway this is a thai bar with lots of thai people in it  its a karaoke bar kinda and the price range is normal for geneva the ambiance is very cool the staff is very welcoming they have a security man which is a very nice guy and will be fair with you as long as you dont cross any lines  can get crowded quickly on the weekends  anyhow i recommend it at least for a drink to see whats up
Always good ambiance Great warm service
Loved it the owner very friendly
OK
Great atmosphere in this little neighborhood bar Very friendly owner and 5star welcome Waitresses listening to customers
Shared a bar platter with the wife then watched the World Cup final here Staff are fantastic atmosphere was great drinks are rather pricey 18 franc cocktails Lots of TVs for sports Small mixup with the bill at the end but understandable as place was rammed Will come again
Awesome Pub went there a couple of times while we where there on a work holiday Great service and great selection of drink Also the food is very good Cant recommend it enough Lovely place
This is your standard English pub Exactly what you can expect  burgers and fishnchips on the menu huge selection of beer good sports on the tv screens and friendly staff I had the godiva burger and it was ok Fries were less good but they were included
Great English style pub in Geneva beers were very good didnt have food
It was a chilly spring day so being outside wasnt the best But the staff is really nice Looks like a great place to enjoy sunny days having a drink or few outside
Disappointing Consumers make the hype Waiters are super slow to serve and the food is just ok Of course there were plenty of people but it does not mean I have to wait for 20mn 3 times for a glass of beer
Great outdoor bar perfect place to hang out with friends
Great place friendly staff Would recommend for a nice drink
Good and delicious food and great music in the background while I was eating Friendly staff
I like here normally atmosphere and good service 3rd price group English  speaking
Lower service No quality food Roti very bed quality No spoon available No water on table
50 60 Minimum in the evening to eat for two Snacks at noon month expensive  Super enbiance and great choice of  including Valaisanne at 450 Pub side No Good Indian cuisine and friendly  Guest rooms preferably available with Reservation
Variety of beers on tap not particularly pricey Nice decor music and vibe No wifi though they encourage you to talk
This pub was just down from our hotel The front desk recommended it and it did not disappoint Super friendly staffowners and really decent prices Food  drinks were great Highly recommend for a perfect spot to relax
This pub was opposite our hotel and popped in on Saturday afternoon very welcoming and we enjoyed the Guinness and wine Our son had clearly been doing some exercise running and gym at the hotel and the owner brought him some fruit afterwards very thoughtful
A great bar Staff were nice and drinks were good Pola was very helpful and attentive  it was a wonderful experience Would recommend
Cool place was there for dinner Superb views nice food
Nice views
The place is cute we booked for dinner The meal is not bad big wait for the cocktails we had to remind them several times yet there was no crowd the person who takes care of the reservations does it no matter how  The staff is friendly but useless comments are to be avoided The ideal bar music for the 3rd age
Magnificent terrace but unfortunately service is not up to par We arrived around 930 pm the tables were half empty despite this the waitress refused to serve us a drink Not very friendly nor the sense of service We wont come back thats for sure
Great and tasteful pizza Good service and atmosphere Super location of restaurant We really enjoyed it and we will definitely come again once we are in Geneva Highly recommended
Good place for a beer with friends They have some tables with the draught beer on the table and you can refill you glass by your own Good quality pizza and finger foods
Beer taps built into the table are a fine idea but the selection is Becks or Guinness which is pretty limiting They offer basic food which can be very helpful but again not much selection
Lovely bar run by really nice people Pizzas are pretty good also
The place looked nice the menu looked great We were seated and then ignored  Two gentlemen were seated next to us about 510 minutes into our wait and they were served before us  We walked over the road to the McDonalds instead
Food is very good menu offers a lot of options Staff really friendly nice design and convenient location
Friendly and helpful staff good food only issue is if you have food allergies your options are restricted Otherwise good value for money
Food was good and place is not bad either but service was terrible Very long wait to get any attention then you get menu and wait for another 20 minutes
So we have chosen this restaurant for Valentines day Its pretty big restaurant and  as expected  it was overcrowded The service is good  but the staff were not enough We ordered marinated steak  SURPRISE  which was a real surprise Cs there was no taste at all of any marinade and it was surprisingly thick  and finally I havent got my sauce for this steak The dessert TRIFLE MANGUE is good as well as coffee  And thanks for the rose in the end
This is a good place for a fast lunch The food was very greasy like in every fast food after all Desserts looked better than main courses Staff was very kind however we went in trouble when we asked for a splitted bill it was very messy to pay as individual
Nice place Spotless cleanstaff friendly great selection of beer outside terrace Food looked nice I didnt eat but would if I returned
Luka is the best Very good and quick service for 13 people We had a nice evening there
I always enjoy a nice Irish pub for a cold beer on a hot day They never fail to please The staff are always smiling and friendly
Going to the pub for years As women my friends I feel fairly safe there on a Saturday night There are always bouncers walking through or checking the crowd Having said this never leave your drink unattended
Excellent veggie burger they use beyond meat products for vegetarian burgers  and my friend said his burger was great quality and super tasty Friendly staff  Not really sure why but I just didnt get a great vibe from the place Hence we only had 1 Guinness and food and left
Very welcoming and friendly staff Great beer and tasty fish and chips Great Irish pub atmosphere A bit pricey but inline with local prices I think
Was a properly authentic pub with a great atmosphere  The Pale Ales on tap were good and they tasted fresh which is a nice change as often on tap beer in Switzerland can be a little bit stale  We sat here for a good couple of hours and it was welcoming and fun
Decent enough but super quiet atmosphere The bar staff were also very slow to serve despite noone else waiting
Nice pub in Baselall the sports etc food looks ok I know its Switzerland but 25 for a curry I had 3 beers and to be honest they were all flat you would not get away with it in England Everything else is fine
Great place for a pint Staff are especially hospitable and constantly go above and beyond to make your visit exceptional Atmosphere is relaxed and friendly
We stopped by for a quick early dinner We had Irish stew and fish  chips accompanied by Magners cider Nice place very friendly staff  Thank you
I travel a lot as part of my job This has to be the most beautifully designed Pub with impeccable details on keeping it true to the Irish culture Ive ever seen Being Irish myself I dont like when people use the Irish name and culture and then get it wrong In this case theyve got it perfect I talked to the manager and found out the whole pub was designed by an Irish business that is ran by a father and son They go to the location and then design everything from the ground up Build it in Ireland and then take it apart  Ship it to the location in this case The Auld Dubliner and the rebuild it Absolutely astonishing work has been done to make this bar aesthetically appealing in every way  The drinks and food menu are fantastic  Food is quick to your table as it seems they have thought of every process so the customer does not have to wait Most staff seem to be Irish which is a rare thing in Irish bars these days This is due to the fact businessman just open an Irish Pub to use the culture to make money In this case it is pure Irish  Right down to the drawings on the walls of famous photos from Irish culture The bathrooms and whole bar seems to be kept spotless with constant cleaning when customers have finished their food or drinks Just watching the staff and the way the place is run is a joy to the Irish ways as hard working folk I will definitely recommend The Auld Dubliner to anyone who actually wants to experience a real Irish Pub
Really nicely decorated bar in Klein Basel with a terrace out front Theres live music downstairs from time to time mostly on the weekend The staff are friendly but not that the bar is paybycardonly no cash accepted You can order to the table but it can be easier to order directly at the bar
You can sit outside which is nice servce is good but food is below average
What a wonderful lady Ms Vivian whim I met She is so motherly took very good care of us and served us a wonderful motherly meal cooked by her own hands Thank you Vivian Love and Regards Sabyasachi
A bit shady but can be fun on the weekend Usually a few borderline alcoholics present
Locals pub in need of a little TLCfriendly staff
Super
Misogyny is advocated here in front of the bartenders watch out
Very rude to wheelchair users You are sent away because you cannot sit down in a normal seat like others

I had the chicken salad it was the best salad I have ever had the fries were delicious too
Rsti Hawai and a beer Perfect post over night flight meal
Great place for drinks and pub food Had many amazing evenings with friends   super friendly and skilled owner cocktails  shots  shows any kind of sport  good to meet new people  jukebox  dart available
Great place for an authentic pub feeling Old wooden style bar great variety of drinks Amazing staff most famous amongst locals head out there for a good evening
Super
Were there for karaoke night Entry price of 4 per person was ok but there were too many people inside You could hardly move through the people In the summer it was way too hot so we had to leave after a cold coke But I can imagine that it is a cool location when there is no event
Great location nice service delicious beer Only the food was really ne zero number Burger too cold and also chewy Bun too long toasted side dishes somehow missing the fries or wedges For a drink and a cozy evening again at any time but I will eat somewhere else 
The food is good but the pub layout and design are excellent Just like the employees here I recommend this pub to everyone especially because of the variety of music
Super location
Nice restaurant right near the train station You can have a great drink and you can also get little things to eat in the restaurant You should look for it when you are there
After the renovation really bright and clean again New refrigerated counter friendly staff Im always happy to come back Music from hits to rock Onkelz NDW 90s evergreens is all there occasionally live band guests very pleasant Football fans will get their moneys worth with games Clearly recommended
Rocker pub with rather unfriendly hosts Smoking is allowed even though food is served I found it hard to relax here with the crowd that was in attendance
Great location in the center of the city Cool bar staff and the prices are definitely right
Exciting outdoor venue for small theaters
Cool bar with live performances
Good bar
Nice Hotel that for me is very convenient
Nice pub with good service and a diverse menu If you want more than Pils youre right here Go upstairs to the bar
Well designed place with a ship theme The rooms are also designed to look like they are rooms on a ship The feel is very vibrant ambiance is good The schnapps are yummy
The best hostel I have ever been to Best prices friendly and helpful staff tasty food a large variety of drinks fantastic pirate like atmosphere and great rock music Very close to Basel recommended to stay here and with the special card you get at the hostel with checkin you have a free train drive to Basel and actually all around Schwarzwald You can get more info at the reception Suitable also for families and couples In the bar they have live bands every Friday The only minus is parking  you can park around the block for free for 90min from 700 to 1900 hours then you have to repark your car The most comfortable option is to park in the underground garage for 12 24 hours and it is 3 min walk from here All in all it is a great place to check all surrounding areas and get back to a cousy bed on a pirate ship Argh maties
Manager steals gin and tonics back right from under your nose Unbelievable when they cost 22 francs each and this guy twice the moment your back is turned whips them off the bar He needs to be fired
Great staff and cold beer
Seems to be either under construction or closed but definitely not open atm
Great friendly folks down here at ONeills If you are into Irish beer a must visit when in Basel
The place and ambience is amazing if you like this viking style vibe I would have liked to have served at the table but I can understand that not every pub can offer this service
Good mead and food If you are into rock and metal you will also like the music they play The interior is very nicely decorated to justify the name of the bar Highly recommended
My favourite bar in Basel Good burgers Good drinks And most importantly great people and conversations
We didnt eat there but the staff was super friendly and the beer was good They have a games theme some nights
Great food
Top
Very tasty food with good and friendly service The ambience is also very pleasant Gladly again
Delicious food and the staff is very friendly and helpful They also have competitive daily offers You can order beer in all kinds of sizes You can eat both inside and outside
Perfect for a sunny afternoon  Tasty local beer cheese bread and sausage  Friendly service
Perfect pint of Guinness Thanks guys Amazing selection of craft beers on draft and in bottles Great atmosphere and some really cool guys behind the bar Check this place out for sure if you are into your beers 
Wonderful little bar Great service and a Guinness as good as back home Definitely worth going back again
Location is perfect for a sunny day plenty of seats outside reasonable prices There is no drinks menu though which can be a bit awkward if youre not familiar with various alcohols
The meal was delicious and the staff was nice Also the bathroom was not clean at all Al in all we enjoyed our lunch here
Very friendly staff and good burgers Good cocktails as well The rest of the food sucks and i cant figure out why as it is not a complicared menuif it is not a burger you ordered you will definitely not enjoy it Three time there always hoping theyll get the food up to the service level
In St Louis France Im ironically in a French chain restaurant Au Bureau Not my usual but Im game While the service could definitely be improved the food is not so bad  First up the appetizer  Fish pops with crunchy rice Pops recall kiddie snacks but these are another league The fish is artfully spiced and the crunchy rice an amusing sushi nod is an unexpected delight Its hearty and textured offering a pleasing contrast  To the mains They tout a toptier St Louis burger A bold assertion Yet as I savor the spoton toasted bun the seasoned patty the exquisite melty cheddar I think they might have a point Each ingredient harmonizes flawlessly  The Mac n Cheese the ultimate comfort food has journeyed far from its American origins Its been Frenchified here The cheese is tangy and rich the pasta ideally al dente Its all you want in Mac n Cheese but its lifted somewhat more sophisticated than its American relative  The Strawberry Mojito that partners the meal is the cherry on top Fresh strawberries mashed with mint and lime finished with a hefty rum splash its invigorating and tangy
Great place to meet Can get very busy so plan in advance on the weekend Food offered is across a very good range to suit all including kids Good choice of beers and wines
If its crowded you should be aware that they are allowed to smoke in there Air circulation is not something they have heard of
Just a nice bar good music nice people
top
Absolutely awesome A very nice bar spread over 2 floors and a really good vibe Downstairs more older music and relaxed to chill with friends and upstairs is a bar with newer music a pool table and a darts machine
architecturally amazing place it looks like the whole place came out of an aliexpress box it is sublimely generic down to its name irish pub
Nice place to have a drink before a football match Warm place and friendly server We went there after a cinema screening and there werent many people in the bar It was quiet and the prices were reasonable I would definitely return In addition this place is very well located The toilets were clean which is a plus in a bar
Great pub with good music a great bartender and a wide choice of whiskey for great flavors To be tested without hesitation 
The waiter lacks respect does not offer the menu we had to leave without being able to order anything
Best ad because no pitcher BUT ALSO THERES NO ONE but therefore a good atmosphere THANK YOU FRIENDSNNNGSSSS
An old pub that has been given a makeover its lighter gray and white colors  But the best part of this pub is the ladies who are serving they are all pretty and adorable 

Nice
I came in to watch live the Womens World cup football semifinal on the screens were basketball and rugby replays I dont speak much French and the bar staff didnt speak any English  I tried my best to establish if they were going to screen the football but effectively told no They didnt appear to even know the game was about to start and told that football would start in 3 hours after the game would end I left in absolute disgust I bet if this was a mens game they would have screened it
Great service and atmosphere Good location and the staff were super helpful I know its not restaurant but even they can improve more than that It was ok
Every city needs an Irish pub Lausanne has two good ones and this is one of em 
First time trying to order some food at this pub and the female staff behind the bar was so rude She spoke to customers like speaking to dogs because we did not understand how the service and payment system at this pub is Of course customers dont know everything and how you work there Your duty is to explain them how it works If you dont explain do not expect that everyone must understand The way she spoke to us was unacceptable For us this was the first time trying and of course the last time  never again Who wants to come to the place where you have to pay and then get insulted by rude staff  If you are in Lausanne and like enjoying your time in a nice pub I recommend McCarthys Irish Pub Pl Ppinet 1 1003 Lausanne There you have full services You can sit with your friends at your table taking your time to see menu and select your food Staff will come to take your order and serve you food at your table At the end of your course staff comes to check and facilitate payment at your table You dont need to pay each time when you order food or drink like at King Size This is more convenient Staff is very friendly and helpful I always gave them some tips at the end of the course as they deserved it The ambiance inside the pub is very cozy You can watch football or rugby matches Toilets are also nice and clean
The food and service was excellent The only thing to know is when sitting exterior the chairs are not so comfortable if you are 3 or more persons there are some chairs without back support sometimes while eating you get tired otherwise everything was good
Amazing spot for beers  burgers and drinks Even late at night And the staff is really nice 
Wow  You wouldnt regret it just come in and order White House Burger  or Cheese burger  I havent eaten a burger like this for a long time So friendly staff  best of luck for the owners           
One of the best spots for a drink and some pub food in Switzerland Great selection of beers on tap as well as a cider Guinness was tasting fresh The service is always friendly and the burger I had was absolutely delicious I also appreciated that they have the option of sweet potato fries which were crispy and not soggy at all Highly recommend for drinks watching sports or grabbing a casual bite to eat
A great whole in the wall kind of place with the best music classic rock in town Good selection of beers a short but existant happy hour and friendly staff
Pirate themed bar great atmosphere rock music sport and good drinks selection
I went here in the 90s ALL THE TIME and it makes me so happy that Cooks is still there I should figure out a way to go after the whole pandemic Much love
It was a bit slow for a Monday night They had a wide selection of drink specials and good music Only a few screens to watch the games
The staff are friendly beer is good Nice interior  there are pool tables and an arcade machine available The food is soso
A very nice bar with very tasty food They speak English so also for foreigners its a nice place They have a lot of beers at the menu also some other drinks We watched a soccer game at the TVscreen At first there was another sport at the TV but when we asked if they could turn on our game they did Very nice people inside great music The only thing was that the airconditioning was broken above our table so it was very hot inside
Excellent place to have a burger a beer and watch sport The staff is super nice and the meals are great Always a good ambiance Not too many white beer choices though
Billiards A real sports bar that has nice Poutine and maple syrup whiskey We had a date playing billiards and even though I lost I had a wonderful time  I used to come here for after work relaxation on Thursday and I am glad to restart that tradition
Huge and excellent pizzas friendly service once integrated with their tongueincheek humour I would give 5 stars without hesitation if there was not unfortunately a ventilation problem the smell of pizza permeates into the clothes and stays there for weeks better to go there in the summer on the terrace
I am very surprised by all the reviews here As part of a team that always ate there after games the service was always friendly even when we arrived late The food is excellent and the portions generous For my part I have no complaints even if the night area does not necessarily make you want to come there
Superb service the very Italian humor is perhaps indeed difficult to understand for some Always got my free jugs of water I think Nothing to say about the menu and prices
Authentic Italian service perhaps not to everyones taste prices aligned with other Swiss pizzerias never disappointed with a pizza large succulent with a thin crust
Small bar to go when everything else is closed Has good classic rock music and great staff and a fair selection of beers Theres also a table football table and a dart board
Great place for latenight hangouts with friends on the weekends A must go if you like rock music
Awesome little hidden club in the middle of Lausanne Nice and grungy atmosphere
Great rock music and good bear selection in Lausanne downtown
Outdoor bar with a great location just under Lausanne Cathedral Good drinks and very generous snacks portions
This bar is part of but not directed connected to restaurant Le Vieux Lausanne Its entrance is about 50m away from the restaurant Check their Instagram for opening hours as its subject to weather The garden is perfect for summer drinks Finger food available Le caviar daubergine et pain was amazingly delicious
Great location just below the cathedral with amazing views over the town and sunset We enjoyed the chicken wings and fondue Great cocktails nice beer options and wine
Les Jardins is one of the nicest place in Lausanne to have an aper The Garden is very beautiful and well maintained the atmosphere is great the location just below the cathedral is amazing and the view is stunning Cocktails are good  not the best ones in Lausanne but still good Planchette and chips are good as well Prices are on the average considering the location
The Old City Irish Pub is one of my favorite places in Bern It is a Pub  Sports bar  It is important to know that this is a place for drinks not for food They have a good selection of beers on tap They also have a great selection of Irish Whiskeys The staff is really friendly and helpful There is also a really nice pub style basement with a counter The basement is not always open I think only Thursday Friday and Saturday As I organized an event for a larger group we had drinks before in the Old City Irish Pub The owner reserved the basement extra for us We appreciated this very much
Bern the capital of Switzerland  An Irish pub in the basement of the old town  The scenery is very good  Nice town  Guinness beer is delicious  A place you want to visit many times
Not a food place Great chilled Irish pub Not like the heaving one in the city
Good  place we didnt eat though
We reserve a table for 6 but they didnt organize that We ask for the gourmet burget but they were sold out We ask for baileys they had only Amarulla Food was good and tasty Drinks were cold
We came to Bern to watch Man City in the Champions League We thought that this was the best pub in Bern The staff were friendly the food was great and they showed the football in the evenings
Had a good yarn and an excellent beer tasting Highly recommend this place
Ok 8 CHF for a can of Moretti Changed prices on the Wednesday from our previous visit Tuesday night
Very cozy atmosphere love the theme of design and the variety of beers is very wide especially nonalcoholic Very friendly staff especially the owner who is also actually multilingual 
Excellent pub with a nice selection of beer snacks bar food The hospitality from the owner is top notch he actually opened up shop for us when he was normally closed Place was clean and had charming views from the outdoor seating Definitely recommend
Amazing great host have been there the last 3 evenings and drinking many Kilkennys  Funny owner we had fun
Very Kind and very friendly Owner Great beer and all in all very clean
Cheapest bar in Bern Good for playing table food ball and getting drunk But the ambiente is not the nicest
Cheap drinks and friendly staff
Nice
This bar is ridiculous
Not enough old school Metal Only NewMetal which is not a taste of whole community
A rather delightful and pleasant watering hole Whenever I am rambling about Berna I always make sure to visit Ebrietas Knocking back a few shandys while listening to some Mayhem and Abba well what more can one ask for Jkxtbdsdomgseoljewsz xx
The service was one of the worts of my life
Great atmosphere great music great beer and fun people
great food and relaxing atmosphere great place for lunch at a very reasonable price
Great place to have a drink or to eat

Friendly and attentive staff Great burgers
Very positively surprised by this pub The location looks terrible from the outside in this industrial area BUT thats a great authentic pub with an outstanding selection of beer including international IPAs The food is also super valid Keep up the good quality and friendly service Thanks
Delicious food nice atmosphere great selection of alcohol and very friendlyaccommodating personal Always a joy going there
a little outside of Winterthur but cool Irish pub They serve Smithwicks 
Very friendly and helpful staff When there is a football match on tv theyll try everything to look for it and play it for you The chicken wings on Tuesday nights are too die for Definitely the place to be on Champions League evenings for a beer burger and sports
Lively pub with a wide selection of beers Whisky Gin and food Staff are friendly and helpful A new menu haggis pie is a must to go well with your beers
Great welcome and good selection of beer and cider on tap A fine scotch selection for the connoisseurs A genuine Scottish pub one is lucky to call its local
Very nice pub Very friendly hosts and nice chats  Great scottish food and tasty drinks Very good for a short trip to Scotland Look forward for the next time 
Great traditional pub Good selection of beers and whiskys lovely and warm service with a strange accent that yet makes you feel like home  Very nice place to go and chill or party especially if youre an expat looking for connexions Thank you very much 
Perfect location for a lunch and cold beer while strolling around Luzern Prices are appropriate to the location beer selection is great and my burger was really tasty as well If you catch the table with the view on the bridge than you have spot on lunchdinner in the centre of the city
The restaurant is right along the Reuss River and is quite picturesque in this area  However the food is way overpriced for basic dishes like hamburgers and fish and chips not to mention the beers were at CHF 970 about 1080  For the two dishes and two beers our total came to CHF 7120  You must order the food at the service counter when you enter the restaurant  I dont know if any sign mentions that one has to order there  There is outside seating by the river  We sat inside the restaurant table thinking a server would come by to take our order but of course no one did until we asked a server and he said we had to order by the front counter
Really really fun pub right in Lucerne The atmosphere is like a pub you would see in a movie Lots of beer options on tap and mixed drinkswine as well Bathrooms are very limited and small but other than that the place is fun
OMG it is such a vibe We went last night ordered a lot of beer and nachos Nachos were really good and service was really fast Bartender was very sweet
Great pub for any Reds fan They have a lot of TVs and show multiple matches but always make Liverpool matches the priority Good drinks selection Friendly staff Good atmosphere Good location which isnt far from the main Luzern train station
We drove all the way to Luzern since the website of the Anfield had in their program NFL game once we arrived the bartender informed us that she can not play the game so we lost the 30minutes of the game
Great place for watching sports   Many TVs   Good beers
Good atmosphere watching Liverpool game with fans
Awesome pub with really nice owners and locals Would highly recommend
Huge selection of beers for such a rural region Im impressed The table football deserves an extra star
cozy place with very friendly staff I go there every year when I visit
Great service
Super nice place Mellow friendly vibe

Nice place  friendly staff but sadly Guinness is not good 
This is a nice and cozy place The quality of food and drinks are satisfactory I recommend Black Burger which is black and also delicious
Super cool spot The music was interesting Most of the bars weve been to in Switzerland have better music than the bars in the US The beers are big and served in matching glasses Pretty cool
Nice Guinness
DARTS  Guinness
Was there for the first time yesterday and everything was fine and the service was a very friendly gentleman Definitely not my last visit there
Very friendly staff Nice ambience
Its comfortable except that I had a 10yearold fly in my beer No apology nothing at all As a host I would have apologized and at least offered the beer
Nice service nice people ideal for an afterwork beer 
Cool people and great service
Pub facility at least 40 years old
Tiny but nice Pub with a good selection of beers Friendly Staff Worth a visit
Peach weber boys
Nice
Nice selection of craft beers and friendly staff
Bier is good Food I ate mexican burger was tasty and good size could still jug down 5 biers after a burger with fries Waitress was very polite and friendly Good place for a drink and football watching
This so called pub actually deserves no star rating at all and must be named and shamed On my way to work in St Gallen I went for a drink and watch Brazil v Switzerland in the World Cup Unfortunately my visit was a humiliating and degrading experience due to the disgraceful aggressive and racist behaviour of the owner Having bought my beer and settled down to watch the game I was told by the owner to make room for guests who had reserved places On mentioning that there was no reserved sign on my arrival that the waitress had said nothing and that I had already bought a drink he duly accused me of causing problems Shocked by this direct attack I stood my ground Then suddenly he confiscated my drink put some money on the bar and asked me leave If that was not bad enough he made gesticulations with his head imitating how Indians talk As I am from London but of north Indian origin I take exception to this ridicule and humiliation  Places like the 0 Five Pub must be named and shamed
Great place for champions league nights Very nicely decorated and reasonable prices
Great beer and friendly staff
We always feel very comfortable in this bar The hosts are very welcoming and the karaoke nights are always an experience The DJ is a crazy funny entertainer
A family bar with a very friendly team of 4 people Good harmony respect attention sympathy all in a service that is always as attentive as possible The DJ is a lot of fun with ambient music or his top karaoke joy is guaranteed My congratulations and without a doubt you have my approval to recommend if you want to have a super pleasant time Thanks to all the employees at the Lindenhof Bar The score is 9 stars 5 from Google and 4 from staff Best regards
Excellent Service is great and visitors are friendly During the week for older people and at weekends for younger people DJ desk is available and there is an indoor smoking area You get small snacks for free and larger snacks like toast or hamburgers are great It is also inexpensive
Surprisingly good for a small pub in the country Really nicely decorated pleasant music volume and nice service
Nice little location great people and atmosphere Plus a very good selection of beer as an East German its very cool for me to see Berliner Pilsner 
A very cozy shop with a very great host behind the counter Priceperformance is really great and the barman is very creative and customerfriendly A shop to relax and feel good  An insider tip for small parties and events 
Hoi these are owners who let others work but never paid them These are new owners as of May 11 2020 I did the painting work and never got the money I was entitled to Maik and Nico Ill be there wherever something comes in from you Tell everyone what kind of people you are

Small and cozy with a nice selection of beer
Nice decor friendly staff and happy atmosphere
Over Head 
Excellent coffee bar staff extra excellent ambience
Used to be a cool rocker place In my opinion not like it was back then
Do I know this place asks me google every time I approach Lord of Hells domain And indeed I do for it is here that I rest my sinful flesh every night Once a weary traveler I happened upon a brightly lit window and peered inside A couple of pints and a freshly made burger later there I was selling my soul for the flat upstairs A deal as old as time itself but as I welcome my slumber in the loving arms of Satan I am fortified in my belief that I got the better end of that deal
	Old pub whit a very nice beer garden 	Realy friendli and nice people 	Delicious food 	diffrent games amazing tablesoccer  every Wednesday 	many special beers
Nice place Brings back old memories
Great guinness smoking room

Good beers very good entertainment and good fun
Worst pint of guiness they should learn how to fill a pint

One of the best around Consistency is key and we consistently enjoy very good burgers some of the best craft beer in town and great company After with kids  big  small
A really good place to have a beer and something to eat I have been there for a lunch during a work trip in Lugano last year Personal nice and ready to help you with the menu And its has a really gorgeous view on the lake
Restaurant with lake View True outside seating as well as Glas covered terrace The burger La Bomba was a decent portion for lunch but still easily eatable with hands instead of cutlery Ill try their sandwiches next time they looked good

I am a finantial independent woman and unfortntly had the bad idea of entering alone  on this Cuba Bar Biel  around midnight  on saturday 04112023  I was coming from a wonderful funny party  that had run from afternoon  and i was in my way home I decided to get in justt a little bit  Last time I had enter there was almost 1 year ago   Biel artistic beautiful like minded people dont go this bar  Clientele are mainly outsiders rude management  ambience horribly trashy  mainly ugly people   bad music  and intimidatory harrasement vibes   There are plenty of better options everywhere  with better music  food  cheaper drinks  larger dancing and seat spaces  with no descriminatory troglodit antiwomen  managenent  This bar is a money making place for the owners and not women friendly  Women seem to  be expected to dressed like hookers and entertain men there  in order for men to make bar expenses  Is  claustorfobic  with a small dance floor  a narrow corridor passage and a large selling bar area There was  no available seatings and bathroom is filthy dirty  I saw a little space near Dj  I put my bag and coat for brief moments in the floor as I was not going to stay longuer and bar was unaproatchble I begin to dance  not interacting with anyone  Suddently a security walked towards me and agressivly subject me to public humilialliation  ordering me to take immidiatly my bag and coat and leave permisses  escorted me to exit  I was so frightened  I asked what had happened  I was not understanding if there was a bomb or something   Answer was where orders from the bosses    Cowerdly managers did not showed themselves  neither had gave any justification  I reasonable presume that they think they can intimidate bully and humiliate anyone specially women alone  if women not interested in entertaining as me their male costumers  I did absolutly nothing wrong  that justified the abused treatement i was subject  This bar should be closed  I was literally  just dancing for less than 5 minutes when this happened I did not spoke with no one as I can pay my own drinks Adding this bar mislead with the name  as nothing to do with Cuban or even south american people  is managed by provincial minded men arabs  that seem to think that women are under rights  I was dressed  for a winter rainy evening simple pants and a blouse not showing flesh  Nice Spanish and brasilian people I know told me they dont go there  I think I was not dressed as trashy as they wanted I was going to buy a drink after but I had just arrived Despite they can as private organization admit wherever they want  I was already inside and their behaviour was unreasonable and discriminatory  They cowerdly used intimidation against me as woman  with no justification  They subject me to public humiliation when I did nothing wrong  provoked me damages  By the above i say to other expats and specially women that want to feel safe  to dont go there I will not enter  anymore  I will seak  legal avenues and damage compensation possibilities for the discrimination  i was subject as was against my right of being treated by anyone in a dignify way  Managers of establishment in Switzerland as in Europe should not be allowed to abuse of power and treat women as I was treated  shame on you managers of Cuba Bar   In XXI century a establisment not women friendly  that use intimidation arbitrary  should not be allowed to stay open and do wherever they want against individuals  There are many people as you can see in other reviews that will not return  that also denounced the management wrongdoings of this place  for example testimoning  they where coerced to pay for what they did not drink  they were dismissed in their complains when asking to recalculate bills 
The food was delicious the atmosphere you encounter as soon as you walk in is unlike anywhere else and the friendly and warmth of the staff increases the pleasure of the time you spend The restaurant you should definitely stop by when you come to Biel
Friendly bar service really nice drinks  and a good atmosphere
Brilliant interior design great atmosphere and delicious cocktails Great for a relaxed evening with friends
Great chilling atmosphere good music and a very welcome personal   
Super Drinks
reminder to respect the people living in the area lower the music and let people know that you dont need to scream or speak loudly to have fun mostly at midnight there are families and elderly living across  feel like Pooc does not care much about the environment and all is permitted which is not cool
Nice Bar with cool atmosphere
I was raised in this Bar and loved it since day one They got a big selection of beer liquor and other beverages Staff is always friendly and helps you out if you wanna taste a new beer Sometimes it is very crowded but it is still a barpub so live with it 
Ive been told that this is somewhat a bar with heritage so Ive decided to check it out Quite nice atmosphere the place starts being busy after 17h The location is great  a couple of minutes to the train stationmany bus stops Prices felt a bit high compared to other places in Bienne but the selection is awesome
Beer is top  also you should try  charcuterie board  Super
Great new place in Beil A great selection of craft beers Will visit again
Nice place for a beer date with friends cozy easy place good locationfriendly staffnice for some small private event as well  They have good choice of different beers but more choices of beer are always welcome right   You can top up the token card with both cash and card  Snacks are recommend as wellvery friendly price compare to Zurich
Interesting concept of self service beers at your own comfort Easily get a card with money and choose your own beer and amount to pour and charge it to your card Through this way we managed to try almost all the beers at our own pace The atmosphere is fun at this place where you can chat with your friends and everyone is happy 
Good location for people watching the food was very good and large protions price was reasonable and generally recommemd the place Table service was quick and the food wait was not long at all
Very good food Good location nice terrace The food menu is not that diverse the drinks menu instead has a great variety I liked the salmon the most Also staff was very friendly
Good beer but food was so so Meals presents very nice but taste in not their best side The steak was overfried and too cold French fries wasnt good wet and tasteless Also they dont have any pepper mills while serving dishes like carbonara and steaks  disappointing
This place is awesome We have ordered Caesar salads with Salmon and Chicken Fish soup and meat balls They gave us different breads as well I must tell you everything was delicious
Pro Great location staff bar space and atmosphere  Recommend the live music only Friday and Saturday singers quiz night and karaoke  Cons Please liven up Thursday nights live music its always too soppy and depressive
We walked by this place one evening and people were queuing outside and so I think its popular with locals and tourists alike Its bigger than you think as theres a large downstairs area which only opens at certain times A good spot to watch football Plenty of drinks on offer Service very friendly and gave good recommendations on style of drinks available
Nice pub in the old city of Stockholm Chill atmosphere very friendly staff and cool live music in the evenings
Very good Irish Pub in the Old Town Cosy nice and attentive staff live music and events The Vegan NOT Fish  Chips was really good actually one of the best Ive tried Wide range of beers and some of them are rotating Definitively coming back
Dont be fooled by the others This is Stockholms only Irish owned pub Excellent service cold beers and an amazing atmosphere where the locals will make you feel welcome Theres a whole downstairs bar as well as outdoor seating surrounding this pub Free bathrooms for patrons free fast WiFi and charging on the walls for guests
An excellent Irish pub in Stockholm even if its not obvious by the name A great tasting pint of Guinness best tasting Guinness Ive had in Stockholm so far My only complaint is that they unfortunately dont pour the Guinness slightly above the glass rim for an iconic Guinness dome  4 felt too low so I give them a 5
We loved the two bartenders and felt so welcome to the bar  There are two levels here and downstairs is cozy  We stayed near the main bar to watch televisionthe football highlights
Worst place i have been to No internet connection you have to order everything at the bar when we got our food we did not get any fork or knifes with that A small burger and the most tasteless fries anyone of us had ever received Terrible experince unfortunatly
Very cozy and friendly atmosphere  Great burgers with highquality meat Perfect music selection  If you are a fan of oldies they play a golden selection every evening There are also a couple of LCDs showing important football games occasionally but its definitely not a sports pub The location is also very convenient Right by the huge church in downtown Stockholm
Awful Guinness pint pulled by the one barman Complained to the other and he proceeded to get a spoon and a rag to sort it out and top it up Shocked they call themselves an Irish pub Im sure they can improve the pint pouting with practice Apart from thats its a small place but could be decent
Better food than many restaurants
Super cozy great indoor and outdoor seating Owner is so friendly Nice food menu also Lots of regulars which is always a good sign 
Typical pub with lots of TVs showing footballsoccer rugby and other sports Lots of beer choices both on tap and bottled and standard pub fare We had the burgers and nachos The vegetable burger was very delicious and even had bell peppers and other vegetables not listed on their menu The vegan nachos were ok but not great However the blue cheese burger is highly recommended
Tried hot shots which were amazing A must if you visit Stockholm Staff super friendly good atmosphere with live music both nights I was there
A brilliant nonpretentious Irish pub in the heart of Stockholm Its spacious has live music on occasion cheapish drinks and a good selection of beers Theres a large heated covered terrace but as is one of the idiosyncrasies of this country you cant smoke there and of course you cant drink on the pedestrian street outside So smokers beware Its open late which is great the toilets clean and the staff brilliant Alex is great Ill definitely return ifwhen I pass through Stockholm again
This is my first time visiting a place I really enjoy in Stockholm There was a guitarist and a singer It was a great evening I hope you success
Great place to watch the footie on a cozy weekend Nowhere near as sterile as some other sports bars Generally a great view of all the screens Some great beers on tap friendly service and good pub grub
Their selection of beverages is quite nice and the food does the job if you are hungry and willing to spend Stockholm level prices The reason Southside is fantastic is because every single time I come here there is room for me and my accompanied friends The interior has a great atmosphere Southside has something very unique for a pub in Stockholm the music is never too loud so you can actually talk to people For these reasons it is a very cozy place to come and drink beer after a concert or maybe a long work week
Southside Pub has excellent customer service the food is delicious the quiz nights are fun and the overall vibe of the pub is relaxing They also have great taste in music I highly recommend you check this place out
I love visiting Southside The atmosphere is crazy good for hanging out with your friends Their beer sorting is very good and the food is delicious thinking that you are in a pub My favourites are their schnitzel and fish and chips Dont miss to visit them they even have live music shows
I ordered nachos and it was good which is rare for Stockholm in general Sitting on the outside was a bit chilly because of the wind even though it was a warm day There is no service outside you have to go inside and order by yourself Also I didnt see any cocktails at all only beer wine and cider Overall a good place but a bit too crowded for my taste
I had known about this place for some time  I really like their selection of beer   However I was surprised when a friend said they had really good ribs   I tried them the first time  Now this is my go to place for Ribs   The meat just falls off the bone  Highly recommended
My choice of the usually burger was a bust this time unfortunately Sometimes a bit cold draft  as people coming in and out forget to close the door Good service
Good vibes Had the mikkeller IPA The place had good seating and several varieties on Tap There was also gonna be a quiz on Sunday at 6pm Very close to st eriks plan metro
Old 80s tunes blasting great beer selection and good quality pub grub Can only recommend It was like being back in an old mans pub in the UK
Really good meals we had the fish special and schnitzel Lovely service from the two ladies behind the bar Will go back
We ordered fish and chips for a group of 7 They were tasty although a little on the small side The ambiance is good very authentic British pub style
A bar at the top of town in Stockholm Bizarrely many bars have English names and themes here The Londoner seemed a little subdued and needs cheering up
Cold and good beer Always open 
Amazing beers and family place love it 
Great atmosphere and good beers
Good place to meet friendly people both awedish and tourists and tourists in kombo with a Kareoke Dog friendly quiet areas if you are an attentive owner Friendly staff and bouncers
3 taps were empty ambience was off not a single TV was open in a sports bar and the bartender didnt even know where the beer we chose was from Just didnt feel genuine to us There are better choices within a short walking distance Not recommended
Kinda strange place Would never have guessed that a place called The Irishman would have almost no available whiskeys Upon asking for a nice drinking whiskey I was given a Jameson with ice I might be the silly one in this situation but I dont think so  otherwise not very interesting selection of beer the taps were very obviously not clean and I had major issues communicating with the bartender Not a recommendation
Great little bar Superb staff good drinks and a wonderful wife to the place
The only important thing is dont have a load off cash in your pocket that you are ready too spend hahaha right now they dont take cash but mabye it could change in the future cheers
Man in the Moon is situated in a charming neighborhood of Stockholm and is close enough to my current office so Ive had the chance of exploring the area and visit this bar on several occasions As they call it Man in the Moon is a nice Gastropub that promises a good culinary experience a mustgo for a foodie and beer lover besides its not every day that one finds a truly cosmic spot to enjoy some spacebites The avocado chili fries is a personal favorite starter of mine Tried Salmon stew which was nice and most importantly lets not forget about the big Meat Plate from the grill The drink selection is equally impressive with an extensive beer collection around 30 taps and hundreds of bottles They also offer just the right amount of wine options to cover a wide range of tastes Its the kind of place where you can sit back relax and sip on your favorite drink Man in the Moons staff are genuinely shining with stellar service While they may be as busy as bees buzzing around due to the bars popularity theyre always warm friendly and more than willing to help and go that extra mile  keep in mind that the bar can get quite loud especially during peak hours If you prefer a quieter ambiance consider visiting during offpeak hours However the only slight downside is the noise level and the pub can get quite loud especially during peak hours which may not be to everyones liking But if youre in for a vibrant atmosphere and dont mind the buzz it shouldnt be a dealbreaker And if youre like me and  prefer a quieter ambiance consider visiting during offpeak hours
A Lackluster Landing at Man in the Moon Gastropub  Ah the Man in the Moonsounds celestial doesnt it Picture an oldworld pub with all its nostalgia then crank up the decibel levels to rocket launch and youve got the atmosphere here The sonic boom is so intense you might as well be having a ttette with a jet engine  Oktoberfest was the theme of the month But it felt less Munich beer hall and more corner store costume section What should have been an engaging cultural pitstop ended up as a roadblock on the highway of authenticity  Culinary Conundrum The Wurstplatte Call it the worst platte This dish aimed for Bavarian brilliance but landed squarely in Mehville The sauerkraut felt less like a zesty sidekick and more like a reluctant accomplice in this culinary caper  Now lets chat about the serverabout as hospitable as a bouncer at an exclusive club The kind of service that makes you reconsider the social contract behind tipping An eyebrow raise here a curt word there and voil Youve got yourself an experience to forget  In a city known for its diverse culinary delights and intriguing nightspots the Man in the Moon falls woefully short If youre in the Vasastan area theres an entire galaxy of better options to explore This lunar expedition is grounded until further notice  In summary this Man in the Moon voyage is no Apollo 11 its more like a crash landing with no hope for recovery in sight Aim for the stars friends but maybe give this lunar surface a miss
Old fashioned but very good quality Good choice if find yourself in the area  Interesting Whiskey selection
We had the three course dinner The first two vegan courses were great But you cant be a vegan food dessert  When the others had pie I had a lemon sorbet that was so sour that it was difficult to eat
Tiny Cozy place  Thumbs up Decent selection of craft beers  Dogs are allowed   Thumbs side A tad brash barmaid  Thumbs down Horrendous music Unbearably Craptacular music It should not be called The Blues Pub It should be called The Tik Tok RnB Pub  My ears are still bleeding  But then again it was a Tuesday early evening Maybe it was just a bad day Give it a chance it might be great any other day But bring earplugs just in case 
Very nice place with guinness from tap Unfortunately no blues this time only rbpop music 
Small but cosy heavy metal style bar in central Sundbyberg where clients can choose their own music The place is often crowded and everyone talks to everyone ec No privacy But still good atmosphere and friendly staff
Love this place  its like home The owners know everyone that visit  they know what kind of beer you prefer and the bar change beer all the time
Popped in for one beer and stayed I was pleasantly surprised when a member of staff told me about the selection of Swedish craft beers available I love sour beers and two staff members tonight continue to be very helpful and knowledgeable about the beers I couldnt ask for more
Variety of beers great service excellent atmosphere
Good place with a great atmosphere  
Amazing selection of beers  great service and good food Wonderful olde world ambience
Good vegan options wish there were more The popcorn could easily be vegan sadly the staff said it has butter Tried the vegan nachos and recommend It has Oumph vegan cheese salsa and on the side vegan sour cream and guacamole
A good spot to hang out with friends and watch football in the city I have never visited other branchesonly pass  bybut OLearys Htorget is quite big and cozy Its average for food as you can expect But staff are nice and friendly
This is a fun place to watch a game play darts or grab a drink However the service and food is a little chaotic We had the nachos that tasted super cheap and not good The wings were very tasty but quite expensive  The service is a bit all over the place they seem to be spread thin However for a causal hangout it is fun
Great sports bar to watch all kinds of football matches The service was quick and the beer was good
Lots of other bars that stand out   The view of the center is good here
Good drinks friendly and sweet bartender there and a nice place to sit out in the sun and enjoy the brief Swedish SpringSummer  Price wise Well what can I say Everything is expensive in Sweden LOL
Nice place not to big nice outside seats now when spring started
Very friendly staff I had a cheeseburger for lunch which was nice The bread was slightly dry but the taste was very good 4 stars for the location which is a pub If I will go there for a Saturday night experience I am sure it will turn into a five stars
We tried the summer lunch menu the beef steak was really good the potatoes felt really fresh and the salad bar was nice we definitely will come back
Very nice atmosphere and decorations Recommend
A very British pub in Gothenburg city centre  The staff was very helpful in accommodating us in the mast minute It is advisable to book in advance as the places gets filled up quickly  There was a quite large selection of wine and local beers on the menu  To get a get real sense of Britain before brexit I went for fish n chips 
Its a small place and very cozy inside Might be a little hard to get a place to sit in the weekends but if the weather is good you can sit outside to They serve lunch and the staff is always providing very good costumer service Recommend everyone to try this place if you fel like going to a cozy pub
Relaxing and calm atmosphere The pub is surrounded by many night clubs which makes it good place to enjoy food and drinks in the evening before you get in the club queue  Good range of tapon beer and if you go before 7 PM you get it  only 2 out of whole range in just half price Ask for it happy hours 
Very nice pub with relaxing atmosphere This place is perfect to enjoy some drinks in Friday evening or to spend time with friends or suppose Moderate prices for alcohol large selection of beers small but tasty menu We enjoy everything Staff was friendly and polite I really enjoyed interior design of this pub  Great location in heart of the city on avenue street Highly recommended We will come back
Very good place fish  chips is the best service is good thank you 
The restaurant has recently been expanded and renovated They have some decent burgers for a good price so its worth it if youre there grabbing some drinks The fries were a bit cold but werent as bad You will need to order everything at the counter and they bring out the food to the table They also telecast sporting events and are open until late even during the week Good place to go in the city for a relaxed evening
Food  Vibe 45 Service 15  The maitre dwaitresss racist and impolite behavior marred the otherwise enjoyable dining and aesthetic experience  Without seeking our permission she cleared the table of our unfinished plates This astonished us because there were a lot of empty tables and the place was not at all crowded postlunch  I will always remember this unpleasant encounter I had during my vacation in Sweden
Was passing by and decided to check this place This restaurant is so beautiful and so much bigger than you expect The place is super clean and h the e waiters are so nice and aware The salad buffet is perfect probably the best Ive seen and tried so far The soup of the day was unfortunately better than the daily special that was a little dry and overcooked But I give 5 stars because I believe they do better all the other days and I was just not lucky this time  really nice place to visit 
In the summer theres a lot of people yesterday when we were there theres not many people its very comfort without a lot of voice  Its much bigger than I remembered I like the style inside  My food tasted very good but too much oil my older friends were very satisfied with their food  It located very central so that is not easy to find a parking place so we took tram
I have been there with my colleagues for Lunch today The place is huge and well maintained and do not feel like usual lunch place but its a bar and restaurant The  fish dish I took tasted good Do not expect the dish to be stuffed with lots of spices The taste is plane and simple  I liked the variety on the Salads With fruits vegetables and beans its really great salad buffet The soup is also very good The lunch quantity is bit less may be but Salad and soup shall fill you in Overall a very good experience
Awesome Sportsbar very crowded super friendly service
Cosy bar good service great burger and fries with a litre of beer combo price The best burger and fries I had in Gotenburg
Very friendly and professional bartender hidden in the back street of Gothenburg  worth visiting
Stopped in late on a Monday night the staff Phoenix and Erika were awesome to speak with the Negronis were among the best Ive ever had and the charcuterie board was the best Ive ever had  It is a wine bar so they specialize in wine  Upstairs is a Michelin star restaurant
My colleague and I visited this bar for afterwork drinks Unfortunately our experience was far from pleasant A woman who claimed to be an employee approached our table and began insinuating that we had tagged in the restroom She was very confrontational and continued to question us despite our repeated denials that we had done such a thing  After a short while she left us alone but later returned and claimed that there was a smell of permanent marker near our table She continued to insinuate that we had tagged in the restroom and said they have cameras and will review the footage Looking back it feels very strange that they have cameras in the restroom but I told her she could go ahead and check the cameras  It wasnt until a young guy at a nearby table admitted responsibility that she left us alone She was probably lying to us about working there as she was sitting at the bar but that doesnt justify why the staff who served us sat with her and watched as she harassed us  This behavior from the staff is unprofessional and should not be tolerated I strongly recommend avoiding this bar if youre looking for a pleasant and professional atmosphere
The food was better than I had expected I like the place if you want to grab a beer in a good atmosphere
Very laid back place with really affordable prices On Sunday they have pizza for 45 SEK and their vegan options is really good  The tables are long and can seat 4 to 8 people so its a good place to bring a lot of friends combine that with a beer for 39 SEK what can go wrong
A great place to hang with your friends and they allow dogs which is great for everyone Cheap beer and good vegan food for low prices A great Swedish divebar
Dont go They have a large quantities of monitors but you can see only game at all monitors Unveiled game bar watch and they only pay for one game So found other bar  If you want only eat is a good place
Nice simple place with a good vibe Food was surprisingly so good have nothing else to say 229 kr for beef steak and 170 for fish and chips
True to nature as it is a pub and have good choices or beer and cider The staff are all nice Although they dont seem to follow their own timing We went on a Thursday and the door states until 2am but they closed  11pm
This is my favorite local pub Cheap and good food nice atmosphere and good opening hours Can strongly recommend a visit if you want to relax for a few hours and have a beer they have Guinness
The best BEST pub in Gothenburg Even on a 2 day trip this place made my trip Great place for football watching but also just for a nice drink  indoor or outdoor Brilliant pizzas next door in a place they have a great relationship with You have to visit
The best pub in Gothenburg Amazing food and service Cozy inside and a nice tables to sit at outside Great spot to watch the football  especially for Newcastle fans A must visit in the city
Friendly place when a great selection of beer and traditional pub grub Great atmosphere and a decent price level A favorite in Gothenburg
Made us feel welcome extended the kitchen hours for us Nice food good beers Very pleasant
We decided to eat here as it was one of the few places that were still open and served food on a Tuesday evening Place was mostly empty just a few other guests We had a vegetarian and a chicken burger Food was good came with a side of sweet potatoes and plenty of sauces  which was a nice surprise To place your order you need to go to the bar so not much service really All in all it was a good dinner
Great roof bar that gets you away from all the people in the city center They have great staff but not particularly good food A good place to grab a drink they are a little pricey as expected of the location
Very delicious  nachos it was delicious  and awesome  also white wine it was really taste Atmosphere is really awesome and i enjoy it Not far from center station  and this is close to city center Weekend here is great 
Good pub played darts not quite as good atmosphere as other John Scott Pubs
Always great  pizzas on salad counter and pasta in salad boxes Life of a dreamer  Dont u stop them The staff is jvla mycket good  On red days no pizas in salad buffe but only warm staff to help u
Nice food reasonable price
Charged me for water D
Absolutely delicious steak and signature burger
Cool
Always friendly staff with outstanding service skills Very good food and drinks that satisfy most people Must experience if you are a student in Gothenburg
Absolutely fantastic heard from a friend that its the best pub in Chalmers and its true Absolutely wonderful Only for students in Gothenburg however but definitely worth a visit 
Always a good move good selection of food and drinks There can be a bit of a long queue so be there in good time
Quite cozy place with appealing decor Yet I wouldnt  recommended it for a vegetarian quick lunch as its cooked or more likely heated on demand Your meat eating friends are done when youre finally served But food was really tasty and the staff very kind and polite so I guess that counts as a saviour
Cozy atmosphere Good assortment of beer and wine Nice location Quite pricy food The music leaves much to be desired
Good little bar was busy on a Saturday night
Very cosy bar great atmosphere and nice service
Friendly and fun bartenders good cocktails and beer selection Good food Roo pie 
Very nice place to hang with friends and presto good beer Try the beer of the week crazy cheap and tasty Totally worthy
Nice place  Nice customer service  Good music Recommended
Nice staff However it was a bad smell as soon as you walk in the door and too crowded to walk around in the bar area If it wasnt a busy night and smelly Id give it more than two stars
Nice bar for a beer and a whisky or other drinks There also is a bar menu available The location is good at the top of the main street in Gothenburg and below the Elite Park Avenue hotel The interior is fine albeit nothing special The bartenders were 5050 One with a beard and glasses was uninterested and seemed to only want to sell the beer on tap which isnt great When we asked about IPAs he only informed is about the draft IPA and not about the large selection of can IPAs in the fridges He also had a rather poor understanding of whisky All in all he seemed to fit poorly with his profession The other bartender also with a beard no glasses was much better The prices are decent and the selection of beer gin and whisky is good This is a nice place for a few beers a whisky and a snack Just order from the right bartender  Ambience 35 Drinks 45 Staff 15 and 45 Pricequality 35 high price average quality
I was in just for a beer The place is at the high end when it comes to price The interior is nice and they have a good selection of beer from the taps in the bar
A regular English pub in Sweden Great food an drinks and very competent staff
Simple bar with good food Nice staff Enjoyed it a lot
A nice bar where when you pay for your beer you can eat a buffet of delicious food and listen some good music
Really nice place to hang out Ciders are 43kr more expensive than beers A pint of beer cost around 135kr Which was cheap and nice There are food serving till 7pm as well as long as you buy drinks food is unlimited for the time Sometimes they also give out nuts to every table late into the night
Wow I mean kinda friendly I suppose The location is in a state of disrepair If I were to summarise the experience in one word Id say sloppy People that can barely put the buffet in their own mouth because theyre too drunk In the afternoon This is a place where you drink to get drunk more than anything else
A popular student place for hanging out for food and drinks They have unlimited buffets thats included in your drink
Something about it is very unique and nice atmosphere However the were really limited seating space even though you wanted to spend longer here
Went out there last friday greatly recommended The staff is super nice and the prices are reasonable
First night in town and I couldnt have found a better place to have a few drinks Great old school music relaxed feel Family owned and run spot and they are the best  Let me know what I should see while Im in town and where to go for food and entertainment Just felt like I was at home Will definitely be stopping in here again before I leave
the place was great and the staff were so nice but the owner treated one of his employees bad in front of me and it was awkward for me
Great place  great staff friendly and welcoming Great banter  Hope to see them again  To Julia and all staff  tack s mycket 
Cozy local pub with affordable food good music and cheap beer on tap for 59kr
Great little pub nice selection of beers theyve got a nice burgerbeer combo and the prices are great
Great place to go for drinks and also to eat Dogs are welcome inside and very well treated
Nice and cozy place amazing service with a friendly staff and a cheerful bartender she knows how to crack a joke   Food was nice and the Burgers taste really good
Busy on a Saturday evening decent beer good atmosphere
Great place The food is super good and there is a good selection of beers  Jttebra
Cheap beers and great staff
Turned up laden with bags just before closing and the staff were lovely got us fed and watered and out in time for our train
TVs are a bit strangely placed which makes it a bit difficult Food is great personnel is great Big thing missing is they dont update their homepage very well at all Still one of my favourite places for a beer and some soccer
So nice employees Very polite The coffee was great and affordable
At first glance the pub looks like a friendly and nice place to eat and sit Appearances are deceiving 4 waiters were in charge of 20 guests We ordered beer and food after 30 minutes after another 20 minutes they came back with our first order and told us they were out of the beer we ordered Unreal food passable service incredibly incompetent TVs everywhere in the pub and a loop on them saying the show was over For 3 hours no one noticed or turned it off or on I hope the pubs in Sweden are generally on a better level than this place
Truly a wonderful find in the city A block from our Hotel Mayfair Tunneln The food was excellent and the service very good My husband deciding on dinner choice He had the cod and I had the fish soup Both excellent choice
Very good place Lots of beer types Good food all fresh and delicious Very recommended  Will come again in the future
Padds one of my fav places Especially for steak lamb Sometimes the waiting time is just unacceptable tho
Unfortunately I came across of what I didnt expect I was forced to leave the bar because I had a hat I asked the security why They refused to answer I even talked to the manager of the bar I asked the same question But he refused to answer it I asked is there any dress codes here No answer I was there with my colleagues from 5pm almost until 12pm Why the security guards didnt warn me at the first place I came outside for several times for smoking and there was not any issues when entering the bar or I was even standing beside the security woman during the live music They asked me to take of my hat off or I have to leave Willingly I said since you didnt give me a concrete reason I am gonna leave They event didnt let me to take my bag and my stuff I called the police and I asked them for help to get my stuff back unfortunately there was no help which made me very disappointed Because I asked the security guards the same thing please at least give me my stuff back and no answer During leaving Security guards used bad words towards me since I talked to them in English and they didnt know I can understand Swedish Then they got surprised The manager was drunk which is really bad the security guards very unprofessional and impolite The conclusion was that this bar ruined my day my birthday and my colleagues day because they left because of me Psychologically it affected me badly I am about to find a lawyer to sue this bar unless I get an official apology You embarrassed me front of my colleagues and people Beside that why you tried to charge me almost 8000 SEK for the first bear  The cameras inside or outside of the bar do not lie
Very nice pub A spanish looking backyard its crazy how beautiful We played darts and had a good time Will come back
Querky little pud with a great atmosphere Loads of old memorabilia Good selection of beers and spirits
One of my favorite pubs in Malm Very good beer really friendly staff and cozy ambience They accept dogs and are truly caring with them The pub is in a perfect central location Theres plenty of space inside and they take the COVID measures seriously so you will be safe while having a good time I can highly recommend it
We entered the place around midnight hoping to get a beer or two They immediately told us that they had their last call two hours prior to their closing time We just left the place
I ordered 3 pizzas and after pick up i arrived home I found out that the order was completely different from what I asked while I was waiting for the pizza they brought it to me from the back of the kitchen not from the oven Im extremely disappointed from the quality that was so poor and use of old ingredients When I arrived home I called them to ask for change and they were very rude and unpleasant Really bad experience and not recommend at all 
God pizza
Great everyday pizzeria cozy no frills interior friendly and very quick service
Good pizza but the staff is lack of emotion
Very good place for both drinks and food charming bar atmosphere with a good selection of whiskys Staff was incredibly helpful in finding the right drink to try Food was tasty Overall we had a great time here but beware It can get quite expensive As a tourist coming from abroad the Swedish prices are heavy to take in And while The Bishops Arms is not high class expensive for Swedish standards it still is expensive compared to most barrestaurants of mainland Europe of the same category
Worst fish and chips Ive eaten in years The fish was tasteless and no crisp at all and the chips was clearly not freshly fried but also quite soggy
Fabulous food and excellent service by  Eric pulling a oneman show  so lovely to spend the previous evening at the Bishops Arms   Cheers
Its weekend and its fully booked everywhere and me   bf was so hungry so we decided to stop by and eat here I ordered Oxkind and taste so awful taste old taste weird Got stomach ache after
Great restaurant the food is very good tasty and well presented I can recommend the buffalo wings Staff are very  friendly and attentive
Cozy restaurant and friendly waitress Good place for spending time with friends However the food  and could have been better
very nice cat art
Nice atmosphere for a place that I personally love to go when theres a football match on TV Prices slightly above the average apart from IPA beers quite expensive and good food Nice service Worth to visit when in Mllan
Mesmerizing service which I never get in any bar of Malmo Environment and service make its drinks best from other bar in Malmo My brain is fully crack down by its total disaster drinks What a lovely drinks 
In Mollan and need a chill spot to hang out with your squad This is it  1 They have board games  indoor games you can borrow 2 Drinks are affordable not a lot of variety though 3 They have food  Also kinda affordableish  They definitely enforce covid protocols if youre concerned about that  Id definitely go back
Last night we were looking for a place with an open kitchen at 2300 on a Sunday  I am happy that we found this nice place  The food was plentiful and tasty We are thankful that they notified us about Swedish restrictions on drinking on the streets so we dont get into trouble later on
Literally the best bar in Malm Not joking My whole gang comes here all of the time all of the people in the bar are super nice prices are super cheap and the whole experience is amazing These people go out of their way to move around tables and chairs just for you to have a good place to sit at I would recommend the total disaster drink its one of the recently added and its delicious I LOVE THIS PLACE
30 rotating beers on tap including a cask ale All beers are served in multiple sizes Get a pint or build your own tasting flight They also large selection of bottles and cans On top of that they also offer a wide range of whiskeys The staff is very knowledgeable about both the beer and the whiskey so dont hesitate to ask for recommendations
Total surprise to find a traditional English Pub in Malm And its stocked with amazing beers Lovely atmosphere and knowledgeable staff Must visit for beer lovers
As a pub it is great cozy and they have great beers from the tap and the staff is frindly As a kitchen it is not that good The fries are frozen ones and it was dry and too salty The hamburger meat was dry and tasteless  the bun was soggy So if you want to drink it is a great place but for foods dont expect too much
Cool place to relax and enjoy a glass of beer Great variety of beers to select from Bishop must have been a hell of a beer fan They serve some hot and cold dishes to match with your beer Nice view to the square just opposite
Cant beat the low price for beer  041 cl of Granges for 35kr until 1900 may be the best price in town  Pork steak and beer combo is also not a bad dealjust dont expect Michelin starred cuisine  yet still good for the price
Very nice bar The location is extremly beautiful and the staff is very friendly Had very good conversations even tough I came alone The nachos were good the beer as well and the gin also Definitely a nice place I can absolutely recommend it
Excellent place Lilla torg needed a down to earth bar among all the others Cheap beer  food nice staff and also a game room with shuffleboard I will come again for sure Enjoy your evening at Lion
First of all there is nothing wrong by going to this place when the deal is a fully Large piece of Pork with this smashed potatoes style around with grillled vegetables and a Beer for 119 SEK you go for it No it will not be best one you ever had however its decent and you will not be hungry after  This place if for the once that wants a good vibrant after work or just a place to hang who have decent cheap prizes on everything  The age group is of all ages 20 ish to late 50 ish is what I saw And they were all enjoying them self in the company they had 
Amazing local pub with Swedish food and friendly atmosphere
Ai was in pub Vagabond after a tiring day It is suburban gem where regulars come This pub is full of history  The head waiter is working in this pub since 1986 and the head chef since 1981 Incredible  Just strike a conversation with them and you will be amazed to learn about the pubs history The regulars buy a silver beer mug and get their name engraved on the mug I wish I had the budget  They serve local Swedish cuisine which is a must to try here  The most charming pub in Malm
The food was good This is more like a neighborhood pub Good parking
Great little pub food is really good You have to go in to order
What you expect but the fourth star since they switched on the Giro and gave us good seats to see it
Great food and bar Very friendly staff definitely go there again
Nicely located in central Norrkping Personnel was friendly and helpful Food is good and there s a decent although not great choice of beer Usually theres a bunch of TVs in the restaurant and major sporting events mostly European football are televised On the downside the menu is slightly limited and there could be a broader variation of beer but all in a nice place Id gladly visit again
Great mood fr watching football matches or hockey Food is OK though up against though competition in town which puts it below a 4star Beer selection is OK aswell
Great pub great atmosphere on point service loved their beer selection and food Cheers guys
Very friendly staff and great selection of beers I got fischchips which was very tasty Interior is classy
Good atmosphere nice beer
Good selection of drinks at the bar and good knowledge
Perfect place for quick beer stop  great service awesome staff 
The burger were quite dull and the price was way to high in proportion The staff was nice though and theyve spent a lot of time on the interior
Alright sports bar you get what youd expect but not in any bad way
Calm pub with excellent food and awesome staff Highly recommended
Great food and drinks selection Staff was very friendly and helpful Super happy we found this place
Fantastic atmosphere food and drink  Mussels schnitzel and Fullers a perfect dinner Skol
Loaded fries omhf vego so good
If youre looking for a place with wide variety of beer ales and craft beer this is the place to go in Norrkping They also serve great food
Small local bar that is really nice and serves good food With great staff With a spot near the river that goes through town its a great place to stop by when out for a stroll or exploring And also a nice place to go by evening if you prefer the smaller barspubs
I love this bar The food and drinks are perfect The staff are very friendly
Nice and cosy environment Nice variation of background music The food is great and the staff are very friendly Their sortiment of beer and drinks is good
Extremely good burgers Pretty good service Cosy environment with their cinema chairs The vegetarian burgers dont taste that much
Cood food good drinks good prices 
Good to place to enjoy some Beer at low prices with young crowd You can play some blackjack and try your luck Cheers 
Great place with nice and cheap food and drinks Friendly staff and karaoke every other Wednesday with great atmosphere
Nice staff musics little to loud the beer is priced nicely mixed crowd nothing special though
Amazing Irish pub with the tastiest meals its super cozy woody and generally quite Irish haha The service is good and fast with bartenders speaking Swedish and English Only downside is prices are kinda high but other than that its great
Magical pub food Best UK food weve tried This is a golden place in Uppsala Highly recommend Staff is great serviceminded and food is  Recommend the Ribs and Fish N Chips
Very nice and atmosfera pub
It has been a while that I posted any reviews especially in Uppsala its just my second one But I must praise where its worth OConnor offered me the best BBQ Ribs that I had outside of the UK or homemade ever The meat was coming off the bone Amazing Corn on the Cob which I usually steer clear of so that says a lot And a really kind and friendly service Totally worth the price for lunch bread a soda and coffee
The outdoor seatings are quite okay Not on a busy street View over Uppsala cathedral Indoors  interior in dark wood Looks slightly old which some may think look charming  Friendly and considerate staff  The food is generally what is expected of british food  not very interesting or flavourful Not much to choose from the menu They seem to be good at some fried dishes The fried scampi was great and my husband enjoyed their fish  chips
Nice place to have craft draft beer Great options of draft beer cozy place delicious food and friendly staff Many good draft beer options and what most important local ones from Uppsala breweries
Perfect on all points  Special mention to the Australian waitress youre so nice and your beers suggestions were awesome   Definitely the place to be
It was my first time here and Mika made us feel so welcome She had such a sunny personality that makes us feel like coming back here just to have her make my drink  Its not very often youre met with such great hospitality D
authentic students bar with great fooddrink package relative to low price Easy going waiters and ambient atmosphere
AVOID The owner is a prick very arrogant and unfriendly If you want to see towns dirtiest toilets you should come here Furniture is old and used as  Our food was cold and the beers where warm Not worth any star 
The burger and beer combo is nice good value for money Centric place
The staff is very polite and super friendly and the prices arent too high The downside is that the music can be too loud sometimes so you cant hear what people are saying Also the limited outdoor seating during the summers when sitting inside can be a bit hot
Some of the best fries While it has some of the pricer beers among the nations they are also my favorite with a solid wheat beer
Gotland nations own Pub Great place
Nice place for students who want to dance on Fridays
Best staff in Uppsala
Good food nice staff You still order from table so I feel they are still being careful for covid Overall great
Student pub with lots of beer at a good price Lively and cosy Entrance is only for students Compulsory wardrobe at a 4 kr fee
Uppsalas premiere student pub You need a student idea and visitors permit to go but you really should if you have the two of those
Good beer and prices alright food but always loud and all the tables are communal so having a conversation with friends can be a struggle
Really cosy and nice pub and the staff was lovely They have many vegan dishes on the menu The tofu and chips was really good Definitely recommend this place
Very helpful staff good collection of beers but the best about this pub is that you can enjoy good music because it is usually loud Disclaimer In Swedish pubs music is so low you can barely distinguish it
Went there on a Monday evening during late October 2022 A small number of clientele were either with friends or by themselves at the bar About 20 capacity Music was a good mix of pop including Abba at volume to hold a conversation without shouting and still recognize the song playing Cosy with warm lighting Lots of old fashioned lamps as the theme of decor Love the antique phone in the restroom
This pub do have friendly and helpful staff  I only saw 1 toilet so for me this is not OK  Nevertheless I highly recommend this pub because their food is delicious and they have hapoy hour offer  Dont forget to order the crunchy and delicious curly fries which is actually good for 3
Their burgers are really good I chose the 440gram burger this time which was delicious The place itself is a bit to tight and the air isnt the best has a funky smell when its full of people
Staff are great time m and the place has a nice chill atmosphere Only place I can find a specific cider as well Get the Rekorderlig on tap
excellent food nice atmosphere and friendly service I recommend
Mixed Swedish and English speaking staff for which not complaining all providing great service Genuine setting and some innovative ideas such as the menu layout great food and drinks overall well worth the money  Bear in mind that the restaurant is very dimly lit which for me is a blessing but might become an obstacle for some
I had super fun with my friends here a unique and creative bar 1010  I suggest it alot
Fantastic bartender He was everything you want in a bartender of such place interesting dedicated and very pleasant to talk to  I recommend this place if you want a inbetween stop from a previous bar or restaurant to the next place
More engaging than the ones in Stockholm and Gteborg
I used to come here some years ago and I always felt like it was a welcoming place and a nice environment But my last visit totally disappointed The bar tenders definitely did not seem to want us there even if we were a crowd of 10 willing to spend money in the bar They did not want to serve us and they kept attending only the people they were more familiar with Also half the shots we wanted to try were not available and they ended up convincing us to try one which we later figured out it was the most expensive of the entire bar
Great Bar for every one so try it out for fun and enjoy thee remix of life
Staff is so kind and friendly We had a great date here tonight
Its a cheap dive bar with affordable drinks and questionable clientele They have kareoke though If thats what you are looking for itll do and wont break the bank unlike the other bars in town Dont expect toouch though You get what you pay for 
A typical trashy place with cheap booze and karaoke on some nights There are even gambling machines to add to the unique atmosphere What else do you need 
We were lucky to catch a nice place in n the outdoor seating ears Bar on tap was very good Our waitress was also very nice Would come again and have a beer
Amazing kttbollar Me and my partner were looking for some traditional Swedish quisine and we couldnt be happier with what we got here Also good beer and very friendly staff
I was here at beer tasting Very priceworthy especially with the food The atmosphere and the beertasting was chill Im not a fan of beer but these ones were pretty ok Wallenbergare served afterwards was one of the best Ive eaten
Good selection friendly and helpful staff It is located on the second floor in a old building quite cozy vibes and just a great place to chat while trying new beers
Perfect spot for a beer if you are a student A wide range of beers and a great backyard where you can sit
Good food cheap beer and a nice place to hang out You have to be a nation member though
Ok place for a beer and a burger although the stone walls makes it a bit noisy and hard to chat
Cosy yet a bit small
Went here for a glass of wine super nice atmosphere and good wine
Friendly and attentive bartenders
Great atmosphere Stylish looking place and the barkeeper was super friendly to us
Waiting for food for like 2 hours One poor employee working the whole place Poor employee is trying but this aint worth a visit
Fantastic service and interesting varied and delicious food Everything was above and beyond what wed expected and the entire experience was so pleasant and enjoyable We visited with our two children and both us and them enjoyed tasting everything from a variety of about twelve different tapas and then shared a few desserts Dishes arrived bit by bit as they should but I think we had everything on the table at once at one point Was a challenge to accommodate it all  The restaurant was busy and buzzing but there wasnt a moment where we werent closely attended to by the very friendly and hard working staff There was a lovely atmosphere there and everyone else in the restaurant looked like they were having as nice a time as we were  This was more expensive than a regular dinner out for our family but I think it represented really fantastic value  courses were priced at quite a broad range and you could so to speak see the money on the plate in every course  Highly recommended
Good Spanish food and nice selection of dishes A bit expensive for the quantity of each dish but the flavour really compensates for that Really good drinks and very good deserts as well The personel is always very caring welcoming and nice I like the atmosphere both in winter and in summer in the indoors restaurant and the terraces outside
Not a satisfying experience Very small portions even for tapas standards especially considering the high prices Service could definitely be improved It was slow and inattentive
Highly recommend this place The food was absolutely delicious Nice staff reasonable prices lovely atmosphere and a really good cocktail bar on the second floor Will definetely come back
Went by to seek warmth and get a few drinks a late and cold winter evening Was met with absolutely top notch service in a super relaxed atmosphere Likely to become a regular goto
I celebrated my birthday at this restaurant and I made a really good experience with Matti and his team Before the meal I had good help to plan the details and during our lunch me and all the other guests felt very welcome and well looked after Bravo 
Went for dancing we only danced and had a beer and for that Le Parc is perfect
I went out for dinner in the summer of 2014 at this restaurant and came home sick The food was disgusting I just had a hamburger 170 SEK ie 25 USD The meat was terrible it was as if it was someone had cooked it badly let it cool down and recooked it It was full of butter cream mayonnaise and other greasy ingredients which made my stomach upset There was a hint of lettuce and some pickled cucumber It was probably one of the worst hamburgers Ive ever had For my US friends indeed I paid 25 USD for that excrement Ive been at the restaurant in the past and it was cheaper and somewhat better Now they have increased their prices and lowered the quality of food I really feel sick I have no idea how they can make a simple piece of meat taste so bad
Ive been there shortly before the closure time and just had time to drink half beer The guys were so kind to let me and my friend to empty our glasses during their cleaning time It was very nice to see how many football fans there were in Sweden just making me nostalgic of my homeland In any case the closure time is too early cause I havent had time to play in the bowling alleys
I came here for my friends birthday Easy to find and nice entrance We bowled here for a few hours and had a nice time They gave out free water as well Bowling shoes were really uncomfortable and the hard wood floor was not helping at all The picture thingy was funny we had a lot of fun with it Nice slushes They also had popcorn and candy The atmosphere wasnt the best a bit loud The employees were a bit cold for some reason
A really fancy sports bar Dont show up for bowling or watching a football match in shorts that are deemed to be too sporty  you will be refused entry and made to go back home and change Maybe add something about a dress code to your website and be specific about not allowing sporty shorts in your sports bar
Beer shuffle board mario kart friendly staff whats not to like
I loved this typical British bar in Vsters  I had a local ipa brewed three km away from the bar I came back in 2022 and I still choose this place for taking beers and eating Everything is really cool here
Nice pub with wide variety of beers The ambience inside the pub is also cool It give u a feel that you are in a pub which is heavy history of more than 50100years No reservations needed just find a table n grab it Food is also OK however serving at table takes time
Went there with my wife and 2 kids A really nice experience Very family friendly and tasty food  The food was great the most reniniscent pub grub experience Ive had since leaving the UK some years ago  The staff were really friendly and attentive good selection of drinks an impressibve menu reasonable prices for Sweden  Id give it 5 stars but we had to wait a long time for the kitchen to deliver I dont know if this is by design or they were over worked or if we just turned up at a busy time  Nevertheless the wait didnt ruin the experience and were keen to visit again
Awesome place Stylish with thick atmosphere Selection of beers was huge and those we tasted were as we expected them great They also have nice selection of whisky The food was also delicious Definitely want to return
Great crispy churros and extraordinary Tryffel pasta  We were 5 people others ate moose steak hamburger vegan kebab vegan pizza Big plus for having a separate vegan menu for the vegan friends 
Went to this place because it was the top rated on tripadvisor Staff was great and the food was good We ate pizza and pasta with seafood  The pasta with seafood had ALOT of shrimp prawn and muzzles Great value and taste The pizza dough has a unique taste that I really liked  Great prize and great food Check it out
Alberts does not only serve good food they create food artwork  Alberts prepare all their meals and sauces themselves and the owner Kennedy wants nothing but the best for his customers and takes the time to recognize customers needs and is very keen to hear constructive criticism if something is amiss so that they can improve their services to the customer  The atmosphere is calm and relaxing with music neither too low or too loud  I highly recommend their fatnyros plankstek medium rare with bearnaise sauce  Kennedy fantastic work and representation  Ill will eat here again
Very good food crispy fries delicious vegetarian burger good entrecote  really friendly and attentive waiter cheap for swedish standards
Were often here during quiz night on Wednesdays There is a nice atmosphere and the staff is very friendly and accommodating Good beers on tap During happy hour the prices are very reasonable and the food is ok As far as I know its the only place in Vsters where you can get decent BBQ
10 beers on tap and more on can and bottle Food is different Croques and the one with mushrooms looks great
Fantastic bar The Sticky Fries are amazing French Fries Agave Syrup Coriander Chilli Sesame Seeds Sesame Oil Soy Totally unique  totally delicious
I liked the Chicken Hot Wings it is awesome better than many restaurants in the country
one of my friend couldnt get in because she was wearing sweatpants but my other friend could although they were wearing some as well the first is black and the second is white we were staying at the hotel to top it off thats really a shame
Inugurated 1989 and then it was hip and cool Today still a really nice view and good cocktails
Tad bit more expensive than other bars but the view and aesthetics more than made up for it An all around pleasant experience
Very nice place the view is amazing but little small so difficult to find a place to sit at times Staff is great Must visit if you come in Vsters
Had a nice chat and drink at this bar but in one part of the bar there was no to almost no music playing That is the only feedback I had furthermore it was a nice and cozy bar
GREAT FOOD and NICE PEOPLE  Its a nice local pub with a comfortable atmosphere that is lacking in many restaurants
British style pub I had a Murphys stout but was poured badly and to fast
OK but a bit quiet Barman needs lessons in pouring stout
Good pub Guinness was lovely and the barstaff were really niceonly thing was its a bit tooooo English dont get me wrong I really like it but as an Englishman it was more English than my old local back
Right in the center of town good place for a cold draft beer and some pub food
Our go to place when we are on rebro always good
The Bishops Arms restaurant has a cozy and welcoming atmosphere with friendly staff However there are some areas that could use improvement In terms of food quality it seems that both the croque monsieur and Caesar salad were not up to par While the taste of the croque monsieur was okay it was not exceptional Additionally the Caesar salad was served at an abnormally cold temperature which detracted from the overall dining experience Furthermore the hamburgers were disappointing as they tasted like they were cooked in old oil Overall it seems that The Bishops Arms has potential but may need to focus on improving its food quality and temperature control practices
Nice place for a bite to eat before the movies a little loud at times but it has a pub style so to be expected Good prices  friendly staff
I was looking for a vegetarian option and they had one Taste was good
Had a great night paid generously for hours of pool Until the security guard came and yelled at us to show ID all of us were long over 20 No one was intoxicated either and the seemingly high security guard nearly went and started a fight as he was cursing my friend  Awful experience especially as I was showing around friends from abroad
Good place to handout in a small town
Great friendly staff and whole lot verities of beer Loved the place Recommend for a weekend out
Good food nice ambiance great personnel
Cozy environment great drinks and nice staff I will definitely visit again The burger I had was not as good as I expected but the patty and fries were great Ill try another dish next time
Excelent food A huge variety of beers
Nice place to drink some beer and eat for reasonable prices
Relaxed Ambiente many TVs with sports like everywhere in sweden very expensive beer 790kr500ml
Its nice to sit there to take a drink and eat
Its five stars because of Thailan the owner Ive expressed repeatedly that the size of meals need to be increased Its a franchise bar which may have limitations apart from this its open until 0300 often has North American hockey daily from 2300ish as well as SHL They also switch channels if one has a preference for rugby union as example The channels available are the same width as other large franchise chains
Small and a lot of young crowd Awesome staff and cheap beers Can get packed and tough to find a place to sit
Great place to sit down and take an average beer Popular among locals
Friendly staff and cheap alcohol a perfect combo for a nice day out
Friendly and welcoming
The haddock I had was unfortunately way overdone despite the kitchen having a convection oven capable of perfecting it Generous portions and a big salad buffet still makes this place a good option if succeeding with other dishes
Food was okay Not bad not good either Wine that was recommended with seafood was tasty though Staff was friendly we had to wait for a long time to bothorder get the food and then the dessert The seafood pasta that on the menu had squid had no traces of it we got two mussles and the rest was shrimps that werent even tossed in the pasta sauce The other letdown honestly was the nutella pizza that is supposed to be server with berries We might have gotten two strawbwrries on that plank I wouldve gotten it a 3 stars but honestly I felt a little bit scammed after ordering something from the menu and it didnt have the ingredients it said it did CRAMPED
Best starter I have ever had Sad to see that it has disappeared from the menu
I wanted to give 10 stars to Service There are really cool people working here very professional but also very nice and social  The food and and atmosphere are also really good Quite happy in general
The meal has been delicious and the housebeer hamlets was a very positive experience The pricing is fine for the satisfying amount of food you get In addition the personal is friendly helpful and offers fast service
I liked this place Found prices are reasonable for Sweden 175225 sek per meal and 6080 for beercider The food is delicious I had laxplanka backed salmon served on wooden plate together with potatoe mash and some vegetables also backed in oven Can only recommend it to try
Both the food quality and the available menu was quite good but the service was inferior The personal seemed utterly uninterested in their customers Orders were taken with a complete lack of interest engagement and discretion The staff seemed stressed and did not have the presence that is needed to be serviceminded For example when we just had arrived instead of leading us to our table the waitress was pointing us towards the other side of the room with a bored tone When she saw that her instructions were unclear she repeated the same vague instructions  Another clear example of their lack of service orientation The appetizer was served only a few minutes before the main dish Why should our main dish stand waiting and be cold while we finished our appetizer A 150250 Sekdish restaurant should be able to coordinate the dishes in a logical way  It was generally hard to reach out to the staff and they did not come around during the night to ask if anything was needed At one instance it took 10 minutes to get into contact with someone from the staff although I tried to wave anytime someone looked our way One from the staff sat down looking at her phone instead of coming around when we tried to reach out Apart from this the personnel arrived and took away the candles from our table without any reason When we finally decided to explain that we wanted to leave the waitress did not listen In total ignorance of what we tried to say she just kept to her speech agenda telling us that we need to go and pay the food before 10 pm if we want to stay  Yes I complain about several small things None of them is a large problem in themselves but they sum up to a colossal disappointment A valentines day night should not be about looking after waiters and waitresses that are uninterested in doing their job  Its a shame Hamlets current menu has potential and the furnishing is as classy as always
We were hungry and didnt expect too much because it looks more like a sports bar We were really impressed by the food quality it was really yummy for a reasonable price My salmon with potatoes and vegetables was fantastic Very good choice here in the town
I love this pub  The staff is welcoming and friendly good service They have the best fish and chips in town I also love their pork burger Flskestegsburgare which is to die for Ive been here many times and will always come back In the summer its nice to sit outdoors with the marina next to it and in the winter its cozy indoors
We had a fantastic evening in the Pub Ro Ice cold beer great Fish and chips Sambuca and a really nice service On top of this we had a nice view on the harbor Clear recommendation
Good choice of lager I had prawns pil pil which was delicious and the cod fish and chips which was so fresh Lovely setting in the port cant wait to go back again
Nice view over the marina Not the biggest selection of beers but what they do have is good
Waited for an hour and when we asked many times how long more to wait they didnt even had an answer They even offered a refund  wasting 1 hour of time and the possibility of eating somewhere else
Nice traditional Danish caf during the day and bodega in the night with simple offer and billiard Recommended for lunch with smrrebrd and a beer and also in the night for a couple of beers and some billiard
Great selection of food outlets Much cheaper than town centre Good beer
One of the best and oldest local bars in the city Good beer
Ordered through fodoora and the meat was raw and the bun was soggy I did get my money back from fodoora but still disgusting
This place has such a fantastic vibe the staff is amazing and very polite The food is amazing and well served  I can really recommend this place to everyone
A fantastic location with great atmosphere and food Recently completely renovated and locally run by a very pleasant family Prices are super reasonable Can highly recommend to anyone passing by
Amazing staff The food is extraordinary I had such a Good time
Nice wee local boozer
Staff is friendly and beers are cheap
Good music and good atmosphere Not too crowded and quiet
Good food very  nice staff reasonable prices
Fantastic Smoerbrod with beer and schnapps served at a reasonable price in seconds A guy singing and playing keyboard and locals singing along joining in and he takes requests Great atmosphere
Just nice the place No choice of food no veg options not even tap water Food not good not prepared at the moment served cold Waitress unkind In general not a good choice
The staff is impolite Dont know why she didnt welcome and keep say no when we ask if we can order sandwiches
Conveniently situated close to the boats and the train station
Good prices tasteful drinks knowledgable staff and some food to try Sitting outside is a plus with the cruisers as neighbours
Guinness seats and wifi are great Minus one star for the noisy quiz old man
Nice environment good service Nice place for a beer and light meal
Very pretty and warm atmosphere with attentive staff Will definitely visit again
Great place to watch weekends football 
Very cosy bar reminds me of an English pub except here its so well taken care of Burgers were so yummy maybe they should put a side sauce for dries other than that just perfect cosy spot
Good varities of beers Food menu was good with many tapas options as well French fries and nachos were good and prepared well
I really love this pub got a real pub feel to it and great range of beers too
It has the vibe of a students pub but dont be fooled by the trays of shots There are 20 taps showcasing a number of local Danish breweries alongside some macro offerings An appreciated break from the traditional Allminelig Pilsner that otherwise dominates the town
Got a sour pilsner I love pilsner but this one was contaminated Complained about it but only got offered a 20 discounton next beer What an arrogant attitude and bad customer service Avoid
Good selection of beers and drinks Nice to sit outside
This is a great bar and might be the best bar in Helsingor Havent tried them all yet as i keep coming back to skum Also great mexican finger food next door Perfect

Very nice place with a very nice manager Thank you Henrik for a great experience
Great place to just hangout while buying drinks of course  Friendly staff clean and inviting location
One the best bars in Helsingor great service and great drinks made with expertise  and not that expensive 
Awesome local corner bar No food only snacks crisps nuts It was raining so we sat inside at the bar and talked with bartender Mia and she was awesome
They have Guinness on tap I went on a Monday  at lunchtime to check the place out Had a nice pint with crisps and olives The do not serve meals Ok for a pint though The owner was friendly
English or Irish lang is missing  To be honest a waiter doesnt know what single malt whisky have looking on me like on UFO Also Shakira music Come on Bar is nice and small just about 56 tables and terrace but like it
Paco is the best in Madrid Beautiful human Very passionate and friendly We went 20 times to see him maybe
This has been run by the same team for more than 20 years just around the corner from the Bernabu If you want to watch La Liga EPL rugby or other sports this is your spot
I have been many times There is a good burger Good beers Sport shows on TV and so This time the restrooms were awful smelling terribly in the nearby tables So I am downgrading my rate
Was a little worried about the mixed reviews but the waiter was friendly the Guinness was good and we got to watch the soccer match between Denmark and Wales We also tasted the DYC Spanish whisky 8 years was reminiscent of a soft Scottish whisky can recommend to try even though its expensive
Not the best of places Food is average and the cocktails taste like they are not made from scratch  Prices arent the best either  The only plus is there is plenty of space outside for the hot weather  One of the waiters speaks English but the bar girl doesnt have a single word  not the usual in an Irish bar
I love the place to much and the people who work here they are the best I wish they  have Many appetizers like the other irish pubs beef hot dogs   
The take away lunch menu is a ripoff 1090 and if you want a drink  50 cents So it is more expensive to take away than to eat on site  ridiculous especially when all the restaurants around have  cheaper menus and additionally most of them put the price down when it is take away menu  Good place to have a beer looking like an old irish pub staff and owner are spanish  The booths are cosy and fun Good place to see football games on big screen  Some food is good burritos some food is very average cachopo deep fried in old oil and some food is aweful the cod Burgers are good
I was a bit sceptic about having a family lunch in an Irish pub but I was so wrong Yes it is a pub but the food is traditional Spanish cooked freshly from scratch and not only is delicious but also reasonably priced The eggs with picadillo are yummy
Great atmosphere  Not really Irish fare  Nice service staff  Would eat there again
Pretty cool spot Loved the atmosphere and service was good Beer was cold and food was delicious
Great service decent pint of Guinness
The Beer Temple is a great place to watch a football game and enjoy a night out Theres plenty of screens great atmosphere good food for the price tag and a solid selection of draft beers
Service and atmosphere is fantastic Great place to grab a beer or two They have options from all over the world
Its notan Irish pub but does have a huge range of beers shows footy and rugby matches and right beside a good Indian plus a couple of Spanish restaurants and a Gino and if you have kidsa lovely park too Cant fault it really
Great place for the money and a extended variety of beers
Best place in Madrid for a real good cocktail well served and best quality price relationship
Guinness and pig ears are the best combination
A nice place to have some after hours good time have some drinks Not very fancy but away from the noise big streets Perfect place for breakfast good qualityprice ratio
Osama was amazing he was very good welcoming and showed us how to have a good night in madrid He spoke exceptional english and was able to cater for everyone Make sure you see him when you are around
Not the best place to go to eat Food was cold plates were small and service slow When we complained about this they offered chupitos No recomiendo no volver Tenes una parrila a 50 metros
DONT GO THERE The worst lasagna i ate It was cold i asked two times to warm it up Bad service  we asked for discount and they offer chupitos Im sure it was not self made at they said  La peor comida de madrid
Lovely service staff are so helpful and happy Amazing drink prices and a nice place to sit outdoors and see the world go by Very impressed
Lovely pub with a great charm about it had an atmosphere about it the barman was friendly and helpfulthe little snacks were a nice touch Loved it
Excellent service Nice workers and nice owner too If you want take a good beer especially Guinness and meal this is the right Pub
Nicelooking typical fakeIrish pub within the neighbourhood of Acacias  Lovely atmosphere and decoration proper stuff good assortment of beers though all of them provided by Guinness so forget about drinking a pint of Murphys round here  Still a good choice of place for having a drink either at its terrace or in its carefully designed interior
Wellpulled Guinness one of the few places in Madrid that does it sufficiently  Always nice to sit on the terrace for a few after work  The staff are nice as well and the interior is beautifully decorated
Probably it was not the best day Thursday the terrace was not that clean and the potato chips were quite old and the service could be improved
Visited two days in a row  Great for individuals or couples not so great for groups
Pub itself is ok but the burger was not good at all Not cooked through and with cartlidge inside Not very good at all Staff tried its best but was overwhelmed due to a football game and large number of guests
Absolutely dire experience I am actually quite annoyed with it and have no idea why there is a high rating here  Firstly to call themselves an Irish bar is an insult to Irish people  nothing about this bar was Irish but the Guinness they serve and a strange decor that to be frank couldve been themed to any train station in any country from the 1940s Its an utter disgrace and incredibly misleading to say its Irish  The Pros The bathroom clean enough albeit tiny Huge queue for the ladies assume they only had one cubicle too  It was busy I can only assume its due to lack of other bars and pubs in a walking vicinity feel sorry for the locals they deserve better  The Cons I could be here all night so Ill keep it to the two main points  The service utterly horrendous Waiting staff that looked like they didnt want to be there Took us 30 mins thats no exaggeration at all infact it couldve been more to get our first round of drinks You know the night is going to be bad when you actually cheer with delight when the drinks come out All night the service was slow and utterly amateurish Meals coming out separately one by one at 510 minute intervals trying to get service for drinks was like trying to draw blood from a stone  Tip Double up on drinks buy two instead of one so you dont spend long periods of time staring into your empty glass  The food Utter pits Irish No the entire menu is Spanish You cant even get a menu in English or staff member who speaks English Even the Spanish food they couldnt get right  tapas with dry stale bread and strange tasting ham Paid 10 euros for sirloin steak which was actually medallions served with the most depressing salad and a lone tomato No fries Had I have known from the menu it wouldnt have fries fries come as STANDARD I wouldve ordered it as a side See my comments re service as to why I didnt ask when it arrived The medallions were bathed in salt bordering on inedible but I skipped lunch so had no choice but endure it Even my friends burger was a mess  undercooked patty and burnt bread if you cant cook a burger properly its a sad day  Tip Dont eat Eat before you arrive  I would thoroughly recommend avoiding the place If you are looking specifically for a good traditional Irish go somewhere else James Joyce near Retiro Park in the centre of Madrid is a prime example of an Irish bar  extensive beersciders and hey guess what Irish food such as Sausages  Mash Fish  Chips Irish Stew I could go on You wont also be bombarded with shamrocks as they arent mutton dressing as lamb or a woeful Spanish bar trying in vain to be Irish  This place is an embarrassment to itself I really wish I could give it zero
We spent a couple of hours yesterday at the Irish Rover and had a good time The food was simple but tasty and the place is huge The bathroom could be cleaner but I generally dont expect more from a place full with people drinking beer Its a cool place if you want to reserve a room and organize your birthday or something Ike that
The atmosphere of this place is fantastic I enjoyed the music and when I attended live concerts there they were great The drinks were good the prices acceptable and the decor is pretty cool The Irish Rover is perfect for a group gettogether Where they have some room for improvement is in the food While it was not bad it was nothing memorable nothing special
We didnt go there for food just to celebrate St Patricks Day for my Irish friend Plus we didnt eat just drinking dancing and general socialising Great staff especially the dj Excellent crowd merry welcoming dancey mood When we got there hardly anyone was there Later into the evening it got busy There was a band playing Irish songs and just making the night magical for everyone Speaking and singing to random people It was a great night I would definitely go back again for St Patricks Day 2024
Great staff food and wide variety of drinks My only complaint is the music is diabolical Absolute garbage music by some dj catering for teenagers who probably dont spend a cent in the place while the real patrons have to suffer No Irish spirit here whatsoever Doesnt make sense
This Irish pub is ideal if you are a looking for a venue to watch an Irish sporting fixture We went in for an Ireland v Italy six nations match and we got good seating a big screen and a nice crowd for a good atmosphere I wouldnt say there is anything authentically Irish about the place but a lot of the time a pub like this is for watching sport and for that it is ideal The only downside was the insistence of playing absolutely deafening dance music during half time in the match and instantly the game was over It was way too much and we left straight after the game
A perfect bar to hang out with friends to catch up a game of football with few beers The place has a WiFi which makes up for lack of network inside the place The place offers a great variety of drinks and food If youre planning to watch a big game with a group I advise you to go early start drinking early so that you can get a place to sit because the place will be packed otherwise Music can get a little loud if youre closer to speakers but I believe Im that rare person who doesnt like loud music
Great Irish themed pub near sol square Good buzz about the place and decent san miguel Efficient bar staff when extremely busy
All good in OConnels lovely pint of Guinness  Nice friendly pub great staff
Smaller Irish bar that cant make up its mind if it wants to be Spanish  English or Irish  Nothing wrong with thisthough  A pint of Guiness here is at the most 12 size  However a shot of Jameson is nearly 3 shots so it all balances out  Lol  We did not eat here but the fish and chips looked great  Location has limited inside seating and a large outside dining area  No bar seating at this time  Prices were the best we have come across in a long while
A nice bar that calls itself an Irish pub altho doesnt really know what it is as serves Irish beer nachos etc and even Cesar salad Dont recommend said Cesar salad
The best Irish Tavern to watch a match or enjoy a terrace with a beer and some tapas Super friendly staff makes you feel at home
Good prices alfigem paulaner salvatorJudas 380 bottle of 03l paulaner including dunkel bottle of 05 480 The most expensive Murphy pint 520 and blumers original bottle 05 580
Love this bar Go often for the trad music they have on a Monday night Probably the best Guinness in Madrid Great place to catch up with friends Bar staff are friendly and a bit of fun Would recommend
Great atmosphere and excellent entertainment from the musicians playing traditional Irish music I was surprised to learn many of them were actually Spanish too
Good pub to watch sports or hang out with a group of friends Drinks are cheap and well served no terrace but a big space inside to hang out Can get a bit crowded sometime so make sure to get there early if you want to have space for all your friends
There for the Ireland v South Africa match so probably the best night to be out but decent beets and very generous gin and tonics basically a pint of it
Came here after been walking around aimlessly The bartenders have a good deal and happy to translate stuff for us The manger on shift was a lovely person welcoming and friendly told us about places we can go for a night out When we ordered the drinks they arrived promptly and they got rid of the use glasses on the table a smooth efficient way without you having to look for staff to come and clear the tables as we was quite a big group and can imagine The pub is a nice and warmly pub  dont have  to  book in advance for a table
Pricey and very obnoxious staff Asked for two san Miguel and seen the first pint being pulled in a Guinness glass and told the lady to make sure the same mistake wasnt made with the second pintwent on deaf ears Ordered a second round of San Miguel and got two pints of Heineken again in a Guinness glass despite again asking for any lager glass to be told that we dont have any lager glasses How can any pub not have a lager glass The barman then went on to insult me by sayingIm sure when U drank cans and bottles in fields they tasted okIm sorry but he picked wrong person to say that to as I wasnt a ditch drinker despite his perception So much for a scouting mission to watch the Irish game on Saturdayit will not be here
A very decent place for a afterwork beer Murphys and Leffe on tap and many more in bottles Didnt consume any food
Love the atmosphereService is excellent and amazing fall off the bone wings Definitely recommend a visit especially if you are looking for a good Irish pub Forgot to mentioMagners
This is a very nice Irish Pub Nice pints and TV screens in every which way but loose Great for watching live events Its a little bit out of the way if youre not from the area but really enjoyed it
Authentic Irish feel increidible live music and best staff ever Edu was amazing to sort table to fit us in and service was speedy and with delicious food
Lost the rugby but worth it
Nice food good beer upper mid price 4 people has dinner for 89 Lots of nice irish beer included
The place to watch sports and specially Rugby we went for the RWC the owner is great and very friendly to talk with They have a great variety of beer and good space to have them
I came twice to this pub and had really good experience on both occasions First time was to watch Spurs beat Liverpool 21 and then again today My partner and I wanted to watch the Womens Super League The owner I think his name is Javi he kindly fiddled around for about 15mins trying to get the womens game on in the end we just watched the mens EPL as we were unsuccessful with the search We then chatted about all sports with him and he even gave us two shots each on the house Super friendly bloke and would highly recommend coming here
Great place for a drink in the center of Madrid Warm welcome and good beer Awesome that my dog was welcome to 
Here to watch the Rugby and the place was buzzing  I didnt see them serving food so cant rate that
Cheery friendly Irish place A great local
Fantastic atmosphere just like back in Ireland
Carabanchel always fun Yes of course
Ok
This pub has the rudest barman I ever met I had to ask for a drink three times  When I asked why he didnt want to serve me He started shouting at me and told me I could leave the pub At the end of the night I was verbally assaulted by another female staffwho also shouted at me that it was normal for customers to ask for a drink three or four times when the pub was busy I went to the pub to watch the rugby match between Ireland and New Zealand on Saturday 14th of October and have a chat  It was one of the worst experiences I have ever had a totally embarrassing incident from very unprofessional staff I was chatting with English tourists who agreed that the barman was really rude I have visited this pub before and had one drink in this pub on the aforementioned night and will never ever return to this pub eventhough I live in Madrid  The response from the owner barman who served me is pure lies I spent the evening chatting with the English tourists and having a good time They were leaving the bar when I left You served other people in the bar who arrived after me before I asked you for a drink for a  third time I waited over 10 minutes before I asked again for a third time in a calm manner I am looking into taking further action on this The English tourists told me you were rude as you told them to leave the service area of the bar earlier in the night Having worked in the hospitality industry I would never treat a customer the way you treated me that night You seem to be rude to some people but not to locals This is very unprofessional
A cozy place but a great ambiance for the time you are going to watch a match Yoi should try their finger food they are really fresh and crispy I really love the staffs there they are super friendly 
I stopped in for a few ciders and a snack while a friend was watching the Flamenco show over the road The lady behind the bar is really nice and welcoming A quiet place but then sometimes thats what you need after a busy or hectic day Stop by for a drink if youre in the area
Great Irish bar more practice needed pulling pints though
Typical pub bar very welcoming we were served again for free The atmosphere and music are very inviting Many thanks to Georges for his warm welcome
Great Irish pub vibes and decor Friendly service and hospitality  Good place to watch games
In few words  True Irish Pub spirit Average prices 65 for paint and amazing service  Food is ok Beer is perfect
Very good sports bar we watched El Clasico there the atmoshpere and the service were superb
Good beer and cheap filling bar food of decent standard  What isnt to like Irish tropes aside
Had a pleasant drink in the early afternoon when returned later on in the evening the bartender stubbornly refused service to us because she checked one of our IDs which said 19th September 2004 Making him 18 However she was convinced that would make him 17 and would not serve us Having worked on a bar I understand how strict you need to be on IDs but even the bouncer was telling them he was 18
Smashed burger was so good Patatas bravas was the best as well The service was very slow but the waitress gave us complimentary drink as an apology which was very kind Overall we loved the food and the atmosphere definitely recommended
First and foremost it is an Irish pub Very nice beer offerings throughout the day and  very nice sitting possibilities outside right in front of the Placa Reial
As the bar was next to our hotel we popped in a couple of times Very friendly and great service although at the airport the next day did wonder if popping in wasnt a bit of a mistake But fantastic bar with friendly atmosphere and superb music
The drinks were decent and they definitely knew how to pour a pint of Guinness however the staff was rather unpleasant to say the least First one of the lads behind the bar kept trying to hit on one of my mates making her feel extremely uncomfortable and when she kept turning  down his advances they started to make us feel unwelcome and rushed us to leave the bar The entire time  the atmosphere felt very toxic and unwelcoming
Best to avoid this place Went in for beers and the bartender lost my friends credit card   Then  rather than apologizing said since we gave it to the other bartender we just had to wait till he came back from break  After about 5 minutes the card was somehow found   Shoddy practice at best Needless to say that card will be canceled asap
Had an unreal time at the shamrock Savage pull on the Guinness Had a burger that was unreal as well Service is really good and has a real nice Irish buzz across the whole pub Pool table screens for sports its literally the perfect spot  Thanks lads
We had the Shepards pie and the home Made Guiness stew Absolutely stunning Combined with a Guiness and a Lagunitas IPA The staff was very kind helpful and nice The toiletssomewhat typical pubstyle thats the reason for the 45 ambient points We loved it Come in and have a good time
Was recommended this place and it did not disappoint  it can get very busy especially when theres a football match being shown but overall a great place  a place to have a proper pint of real beer not fizzy pop lager that is served at room temperature and chilled to the point of it being undrinkable like alot of Irish Bars in Barcelona  The food is second to none apart from the chips  why upon why do places insist on serving frozen chips  would be so much better with real hand cut chips  Overall a great place to go
This place has a great atmosphere and they serve nice big glasses of beer for a great price They have a pool table people were friendly I got the chicken curry which wasnt terrible but I guess maybe you dont go to an Irish pub for Indian food
Best IrishBritish style pub in Barcelona Its huge but still cozy staff are friendly and prices are better than other pubs in the area The architecture of the place is beautiful too The reviews complaining about tourists are ridiculous  yeah there are tourists but obviously it isnt going to be a super local place because locals will just go to Spanish places
Great place located on the busy las ramblas real pub like feel and atmosphere felt like I was transported home They had live music in the evening some awesome songs belted out creating a lovely atmosphere overall Drink prices more than reasonable Cocktails were well balanced and you can pay a little bit more to make your drinks even strongerloved this option Plus they have Guinness on tap The staff were always helpful and service was prompt Thank you for a great night out
Absolutely great location on La Rambla and probably only club without a entrance fee around it   been here multiple times and never had a problem getting in  The drinks and beer can get pretty expensive but you gotta expect that when partying in centre Otherwise loved the atmosphere and met here many amazing people every single time  Great pub for students and travellers   Also theres this photostand that could take a picture of you and send it to you afterwards Great feature D
Extremely slow service during the womens World Cup final Not enough staff working on the day Nachos tasted off the guacamole had gone bad Atmosphere was good due to the football fans
The bar is quite pricey so be ready to pay more for a beer than you did in Dublin The vibe is nice they play good music however wouldnt say it attracts the best crowd
Fantastic little place very friendly locals and great fun bar team
According to their timetable they should have been opened since 1900 at 1925 today was still closed 
Bad service and bad treatment towards some people
I love to be there every weekend
Hands down my favourite bar in Barcelona The Fastnet is my second home Its the place where I made my friends and found a sense of belonging when I first moved to Barcelona The owners and staff are so warm and friendly and they really take the time to get to know their regulars Its warm and toasty on the coldest of nights and the pub quiz on Thursdays is honestly such fun though Id advise bringing a multigeneration group if you hope to stand a chance against the house champions since the questions are super varied Whenever theres any sports on the whole bar comes to life in a most magical way Im really glad to have found this bar and grown into one of its regulars
Hands down the best Irish Pub in Barcelona period The owner Shane is a Gentleman I had the buttered chicken curry that was dynamite Great staff cold beer  blocks from the beach What more do you need in life Cant wait to go back
The best Irish bar iv ever come across on my travels If you happen to stop in for food I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the chefs butter chicken Its absolutely outstanding Iv had butter chicken all over the world but nothing compares to this bad boy Please give it a try if youre in town
Good Irish pub lovely Guinness grand atmosphere friendly host Great sailing pictures and paintings some classic brass binnacles Lovely outside seating Craic is good 
Busy Pub with great beers friendly punters and competent not necessarily friendly barman During a Barcelona football match until 830 followed by an Irish RWC game against the Springboks one has to give this pub credit Crowded but able to get a drink and food in good time TVs well positioned so everyone can watch Although understaffed for such a huge sportsday the guys behind the bar managed to continue to pour perfect pints let her rest fir 30 seconds and shell be perfectmaintain service levels and support a super fun evening Hats off
Fantastic pub Two different bartenders on different visits and both were friendly and gave great service Nice selection of cocktails and the food was great to
Had a fun night of drinks and great music at Temple If you like 90s  2000s rock  alternative  their playlist is right up you alley The atmosphere was very lively and our bartender was super nice Cant remember his name but great service form him The cocktails are reasonably priced for the size you get 8 We didnt have food but the food we did see looked good The only downside was the bathroom situation on the main floor only one toilet Overall good vibes easy to chat to people and close to Las Ramblas 
Watched sport in comfort not too crowded Guinness was excellent and overall well decorated bar
Very cool Irish bar  The drinks were good and will proceed and the service was outstanding  Highly recommend
Firstly the ambience is what draws you in Well  besides the big sign that says guiness outside I havent had the pleasure of being to Ireland but Ive tried Guiness in five countries and this bar it simply served the best and is my standard of Guiness Finally Ursula and the staff have always been super receptive and very friendly and warm to everyone who comes in Highly recommend a stop here
I like to beers and atmosphere price is fair enough barmen was kind
AVOID AVOID AVOID  Absolutely awful behaviour from the woman manager  security  Firstly she was forcing groups to get as close as they could to a table She made it incredibly clear with a very aggressive tone that if you didnt buy a drink you would be kicked out immediately  This created an awful atmosphere and someone on a different table didnt want a drink but the manager wasnt having it at all  She snatched one of the groups beers into a cup spilling it in the process and took it outside The argument then escalated because of it The group were trying to reason and question the very odd and aggressive attitude  The manager was saying that because she hadnt paid for a drink she was no longer a customer and had to leave  I NEVER leave a review and this is the only time I felt I need to say something  We will never go again and will always tell friends to avoid it from now on  Incredibly rude manager and incredibly aggressive security as well Awful experience
Really nice woodinterior Irish pub with a lot of character Bartenders were fun and welcoming Bathrooms were pretty bad mens at least Beers were good and food was OK and large portioned We could have ordered something better There was a bit of an insect issueyou can guess the type
Very authentic Irish pub just thought Id pop in cause my name is Michael Colin and they gave me a free glass  very friendly service so Ill definitely be coming back to try the food
Close to La Sagrada  this is the perfect spot to chill Nice and cosy vibe to enjoy your drinks and food
To the owner please fumigate this bar On Saturday I came for the music but it was completely full so we had to sit at the bar instead While sitting at the bar we saw at least 6 cockroaches crawling on the bar walls and floor We were so disgusted we moved seats but were worried that we might have cockroaches in our beers and kept checking around for roaches I have been here before and enjoyed my time previously but I definitely wont be back until I know the cleanliness has greatly improved
The only reason I am giving them 2 stars instead of 1 is because the service was generally friendly and welcoming upon arrival  As far as the drinks go the margarita I ordered was the worst margarita Ive ever had in my life and it was served in a martini glass so much smaller than usual  Also my friend was charged for her drink when she closed her tab and I was charged for her same drink on my tab So be careful to review your tab and make sure it is correct before paying  Would not recommend this place There are better options for pubs in Barcelona
great Irish restaurant The host is super nice The food was phenomenal If you are in Barcelona and like Irish ambiance this is the place for you
Amazing atmosphere really lovely staff The menu is somewhat limited but their desserts are delicious Service in English and Spanish available The bathroom was clean too Overall loved the James Joyce experience Literature fans Irish lovers and those seeking a nice break will have a great time here
Its ok Nice atmosphere in terms of decor the food wasnt particularly great we got fish and chips and chicken burger The fish and chips were nice but the burger patty dry just like the burger bun The girl at the bar wasnt especially nice either
Great pub visiting from Scotland for the week to see some friends and have came to this bar multiple times Really good atmosphere and the staff are very polite and helpful there were 2 Irish barmen from Cork who were particularly accommodating Highly recommend
Great pup to watch sporting events  Their decor is great too  Feels like you are in a church We went to watch the F1 Brazil race and they promised to put it on and they did  Wings and drinks were good  Amanda gave us excellent service as did the waitress before her but we didnt get her name  Table 30
Had a great time watching NFL Redzone with my boyz  special thanks to Amanda for making us feel right at home
Fantastic food service and atmosphere An absolute gem and must visit Special thanks to the lovely Irish girl with brunette hair didnt get your name but thanked you personally for your service before we left  an absolute angel who took the time to look after us so well Thank you
This is the first bar we stopped at when we arrived in Barcelona It wasnt too crowded has a very chill vibe and the bartender Tom was awesome Tom made the experience badass because he was very welcoming and informative He suggested some amazing restaurants as well as fun places to visit in and around Barcelona Its definitely one of my favorite bars in Barcelona Stop by have some whiskey and say Hey to Tom if youre in the area
Best Irish pub in town Owner has consoled me multiple times when crying for no justifiable reason in the bathroom Ken chooses his staff well Great atmosphere Toilet always has loo roll
We ducked in here during a rainstorm to avoid getting soaked and were really glad we did After all its true what they say wherever you go around the world youll find an Irish pub  Stop in have a pint watch some futbol and chat with the bartender whos from Ireland naturally This is a great little spot in Barcelona
Brilliant atmosphere Fantastic staff  Very nice to us and put on rugby matches for us  Definitely worth a visit if you are in Barcelona An Irish bar that really is an Irish bar
Arrived good and early for the rugby match and kept a seat free for one of our group who was arriving later due to work Was told that she wasnt allowed in because it was full  There is an empty seat for me over there Barman on a power trip Were full There are literally three seats right behind you so you are obviously not full Barman on a power trip Were full  First and last time
Best Guinness in Barcelona Didnt eat here so cant rate the food
Among hundreds and hundreds of bars and places that are mostly the same this little bar is definitely the best Staff is super friendly and take care that you obliterate yourself from alchohol nice and slowly As soon as you start aproaching the bottom waiter jumps in to the save  Not only that if you want live Irish music in the midst of Barcelona this is your place Gg guys thank you
Love the Atmosphere And i love the pub quiz they do every thursday Eamon and George are the best bartenders Try the cheese toasty
Its a great pub location that offers more than just the normal pub menu There is an item for everyone on the menu here The food was very well priced for the portion you got Everyone in the group of 7 ordered something different and we were all impressed with the food I would recommend this place for sure
Bar looks super cool food is ok nothing special Cocktails are great
OMG That was a ride yesterday  Guitar guy Fabio was insane Staff did their best to facilitate all the orders quickly despite the fact that place was like supercrowded Fair pricing 
Classy place to drink at Decor reminds us of English empire Nice choice of beers with attractive price
Friendly staff placed a football match on TVsprojectors by our request best nachos in town
I will try to make a constructive comment here I had this place rated 5 stars but I have to go down to 2 for now This is not anymore the old Wild Rover where we use to come since many years for any rugby game and this is not anymore an Irish Pub either Only Estrella on tap Guinness in bottle Weve lost the good old pub ambiance the bar being kind of neat with new useless neon lights and sofa kind of stuff Rugby world cup opening game only screening in Spanish  and no sound not audible Weve been explained that its a local law keeping volume down but come on guys how do other pubs do then  And how did wild rover use to do Its been such a let down for every single person in the pub who came yesterday to watch this big big game and obviously wanted to watch it with English comments and with sound ambiance Very very long queue to order a beer Heads up to the staff who clearly wants to do its best and being very nice and took the time to speak and explain things but new owners clearly got something wrong there and definitely needed a 2 yesterday at the counter Food was quite good although not that cheap Lots of room for improvement then and I understand that its only the beginning but were not gonna risk it next time and will surely go to another real Irish pub to find that special rugby game day ambiance at least until the end of this World Cup After the loss of Shenanigans in Raval thats another letdown for rugby fans in Barcelona city center
After searching for a pub that would play the F1 live we found The Wild Rover This is a bar that is totally dedicated to sport We settled at a table close to the VERY big screen and ordered some food and drinks We had the Dip Nachos with Cheddar Guacamole and Salsa plus the Pizza Margarita and the Mozzarella Sticks The food was good for pub food and was also hot and quick The staff also continued to take drink and food orders from our tables during the race to save us heading to the bar and we also saw them helping other customers who arrived late and had not secured a position yet with chairs both gestures were nice to see Would definitely recommend this sports bar especially if wanting to see live sport while youre abroad
Almost back to how it was before when the venue went through a phase as a swanky shisha bar Lovely staff finding their feet and a good Irish pub atmosphere They do need to get Guinness back on tap again though as 6 for a half pint of the black stuff from a bottle isnt really on now is it
The Dublin bar is a great place to come  The staff are really friendly and welcoming they do a lot to make you feel at home  they are really chatty and it makes for an amazing atmosphere  Would definitely recommend coming to the Dublin bar if you are in Barcelona  Felipe was the best Barman in Barcelona
Filipe is sort of like Triple H if he worked in a bar He figuratively gave me a Pedigree with his immaculate service Fantastic
Been Irish  we were excited to enter an Irish bar on holiday but the bar man was lovely really quiet  Cocktails were good
Friendly vibrant staff make you feel very welcome Good atmosphere and the bartender gives value for money with the drinks Deffo recommend 1010
1050 EUR for a pint and a coke The other Irish bar 5 minutes away was doing 2x beers for 595 EUR Also weird vibes Techno music playing during the football Odd
Arrived late to Barcelona and stayed close by Was only delighted to find Cheers for a couple of late beers Very nice staff and authentic irish bar abroad feel Many thanks for your hospitality
Good place to drink some beers and watch football There are two big screens The bar doesnt reserve seats but usually is not so crowded I watched there Villarreal vs Liverpool game and the bar became full at the end of the game The staff is nice and friendly Only cons is that the Spanish bear is only bottled
Arrived hours early to secure a table to watch the champions league final and was forced to move seats 5 minutes after the game started to accomodate a larger group and ended up being placed on chairs in the middle of the room
Dud not enjoy Not at all like an Irish Pub Poor vocalist Indifferent service No atmosphere Pub long and narrow
I was there for the clasico match Madrid vs Barcelona There was only one   1  barman at the place Hows this possible One barman for such an important match I heard people asking for food The barman said no food was available No personnel for such a date  What shocked me the most is that when I tried to pay for my drink the barman said it is impossible to pay here with cards but right after the match finished he pulled out the payment terminal for signal I myself was counting for coins to get a drink And I didnt even get my change back For my own piece of mind I preferred to try to enjoy the match then to get into an argument for some change I heard also people struggling to make their payment because they didnt have cash and even going out to search for an ATM after they were served in the middle of the match There was no sign for this They runed out of beer I was served an Estrella on the same glass the barman served me a Heineken  Something is really off with this place Really off  The only thing I appreciate is that I was lucky to find a spot to watch the match on a dirty screen of a TV that clearly needed cleaning  Again something is really off with this place I felt I was in a tavern at the Shire and even that I would get but this
Had a great time watching Barcelona vs Manchester United but they had no Irish beer no Guinness no Murphys so we drank German beer at an Irish pub
Horrific service bad food and high prices I am never coming back here
A very classy Irish sports bar situated in the heart of Barcelona The staff were very friendly and they put  my local football team match on the television with no questions asked The price of drinks were very reasonable and they came with some complimentary popcorn I hope the manger has a great holiday in Southampton 
Strange representation of an Irish pub Showing Fiji and Wales while Ireland played Holland live Probably satisfies a different demographic Students having fun and no harm but far removed from Irish hospitality
To busy and couldnt stand outside unless you was sat down  to hot inside
Fun place with nice staff and good entertainment  We saw a Liverpool win and enjoyed two person band playing classic music from 70s 80s Good outdoor seating that was bustling  One drawback was a disappointing Guinness It was a good pour but thin and bitter I should have read the room and saw no ne else was drinking it
Brutal
I not think words
Great ham charity event enlivened with a multitude of live performances ngel Marn professional flamenco school a very good rock band and a scandalous atmosphere for a good cause for the benefit of AFANAS Despite the heat it was worth it
We were there this afternoon having a coffee which by the way was very good and a drink There is a blonde camera girl very nice friendly and attentive He took great care of us
The food tasted like it was microwaved the drinks were warm The only good thing was one guy from the staff I think his name is Emet was very nice The price for drinks a bit higher for Spain I dont think were coming coming back
Lovely wee barfantastic musicianlovely wee bar attendant Bar maid had a face like a slapped arsereally didnt want customers it seemed Screwed her eyes up when asked to make a cocktail Music made the night 
2hrs of buying drinks and barman removed only fan on us inside in 30degree plus heat to give to his friends as soon as they walked in No AC and no windows where we were sat Asked why and he said they were hot  Basically tough s Seriously   Had to leave immediately as temperature was unbearable Nice for his mates by window with fan though Would never go back
If you get a chance get to this bar  A fab pint of Guinness Great staff Give it a go I dont think you will be disappointed
Morrisseys Irish Pub in Malaga is a top spot for sports enthusiasts Attended during the Rugby World Cup and the experience was memorable An impressive beer selection with Delirium being my favorite Multiple screens ensure a good view of the game The ambiance is lively patrons are amiable and service is on spot and fast Dont miss out on their delectable ribs Highly recommended
At first seems like a nice bar in the city center Ordered a sex on the beach cocktail SHOCKED when I got the cocktail You pay 750 for a glass of ice When telling the young waiter He literally says well I dont make them so I cant do anything Better skip this place
Went to Morrisseys to watch the GAA coverage Staff went out of their way to make not just us but the people around us happy Food was very good Best Nachos Ive had
Had a fun night watching champions league final and enjoying smth to eat and drink There was one waiter who seemed he can wait us to leave I dont know why tbh
I had a very disappointing experience at this Bar The barkeepers behavior was extremely unprofessional We were asked if we wanted to order drinks just 30 minutes before closing time and 15 minutes later he abruptly informed us it was the last round When we politely requested more time or information about the closing time he responded rudely and even threatened to call the police This kind of treatment is unacceptable and leaves a negative impression on customers I would advise others to be cautious when visiting this Bar
Great location Plenty of outside seating Standard selection of local beers  one Belgian beer from the bottle Service was great from the waiter with the illfitting trousers Football was being shown on the screens
Nice place to sit and watch the crowds in the city centre  Reasonable prices attentive service
Ordered some wine and sparkling water for three and apparently they closed 5 min later did not warn us Literally threw us out Red haired girl was veryyyyyyy rude Very unsatisfying
Really excellent bar serving an incredible variety of different beers wines and spirits Staff were attentive and knowledgeable and a nice mix of Malaga locals and visitors in the clientele Wouldnt hesitate to recommend and will definitely be visiting again on our next trip to Malaga
This is a fantastic deal at a short distance near Malagas city center Everything you could want is here Dcor and arrangement are fantastic Their bartenders were more than happy to assist you in perusing the selection of drinks I wholeheartedly endorse it for anybody searching for an alternative to a tourist path or just for a more tranquil experience The costs in my opinion were pretty fair considering the location and the options available The standard drink is only 19 whereas a triple JB  cola costs 6 Awesome
A quiet evening spoilt by getting over charged by the bar staff Beware as he charged us 90 Euro for a six euro bottle of CAVA with no receipts Would suggest you give this place a miss
Absolutely delighted with this great find in Malaga just a walk away from the centre  Great selection of  EVERYTHING  Superb decor and layout Staff were all too pleased to help guide you through the catalogue of beverages on offer I sincerely recommend to all looking for a break from the tourist route and in search of something more relaxed I personally found the prices very reasonable for the surroundings and selection on offer just 19 for a small beer and 6 a double JB and coke Great
Best place to have a drink in Huelin perfect service This place was the turning point to buy an apartment five minutes from the bar  Elreykari and Ullis
Our favorit bar in Huelin Always welcoming and small enough to give that friendly vibe when you go there Also great Mojitos 
Wonderful place with great atmosphere and service was excellent thanks for one of the best evenings during whole holidays
Wide selection of spirits at great prices in a small pub next to the beach Trivia night on Thursday
Worst place ever No right to call itself an Irish bar when they employ nothing but rude arrogant employees The girl was arrogant and rude with zero people skills  just made us feel uncomfortable Its like customers are an inconvenience as we interrupt her chat with friends Never again plus it was expensive We visiting Monday 18th September at 1530
Came here for 2 beers and had to ask staff to clean table We paid 3 for each small beer At this price you would expect good toilets The toilets are in a room with beer barrells and toilet was dirty There was no toilet paper and no hand washsoap I asked the waitress for both You would think by her attitude that this was not a service required to be provided The waitress went next door and came back with a bowl of washing up liquid I asked wbat the staff used to wash hands and she told me waterunbelievable avoid this place
Just awful rude staff over priced drinks not even sure it was alcohol 10 euros for shot of vodka  I foolishly ordered a second thinking it was small measure When bill came I was horrified when I questioned the staff told that is the price Shame there was no menu Pls be warned  Shameful they call them selves an Irish bar we would never rip our customers off
AVOID TOURIST TRAP No prices on any drink Payed 60 for four regular drinks Rude staff and toilet is in the stock room Much better places around in the city
Excellent irish breakfast and friendly staff would highly recommend 
Decent food Would be better if they had paper straws instead of plastic ones
Chino Chinese  Tudor rose has great food
Proper breakfast great staff suntrap 
Nothing Irish about the place other than the name but nice spot in a great location
Good beer
Awful
Last night we were a group of friends sitting on the terrace the treatment and attention from the waitress was excellent We ordered among other things two glasses of Martin Millers as soon as they arrived at the table just by smelling them we realized that it was not Martin Millers and when we tasted it we noticed that it was very strong We told the waitress that this is not what we ordered and she brings us the bottle so we can see it to say yes In conclusion they laugh at the client play with their health paying 16 for two jug glasses as is the case
What made this place was the people we met within One female celtic and her husband a rangers fan As I said to him  not  really his fault I blame his family lol All the same I hope they know what this meet meant to me and my wife Emotional and instructive A real reason to look within oneself Thank you
Great pub with a friendly local atmosphere and amazing staff I went in multiple times alone great for a game of pool to meet people or play some darts
Great for the football in central Malaga Inside and outside areas The bartenders and managers are great Friendly speak English and helpful Snooker table dartboard and the pub is based of course on the Peaky Blinders Try it
I initially thought itd be corny with the Peaky Blinders theme but there is a nice vibe here  pool sport friendly people and waiters Also the Hop House 13 genuinely tastes better than a lot of pubs in Ireland
Great place for live football Competitive prices and very friendly staff
The pup is good the place is very cool the drinks are at reasonable prices and the atmosphere is not bad
Spacious clean place and excellent treatment Variety of drinks GIANT SCREENS TO WATCH SPORTS A 10
The waiter is very friendly respectful and handsome and has magnificent hair as well as being very noble there is no better bar there
not an irish bar at all when it comes to Atmosphere no music drinks took a while staff are standing outside beside our table having conversations so loudly really rude  unapproachable
Friendly staff good variety of drinks smokervaper friendly with shishas bar games and great atmosphere The only downside is pricing which is a bit high for pints but besides that its a great place
They have specially high tourist prices be careful And the terasse is closing earlier they are not informing but suddenly pushing you inside even there is not space anymore ridiculous The Manager how she called herself was pretty rude and didnt understand why we are mad to stand with a bunch of drinks and a hookah in the middle of the bar without getting a place after we paid double price for everything
Fake price cocktail on new year only filled with ice without alcohol But cute bartender
Honestly it has been the best treatment I have received in my entire life my two friends and I are very happy I dont give it 10 stars because there arent any Very good food and perfect price Super recommended they deserve it all
Very good attention from both the waiter and the cook as well as the owner homemade food it feels like home if we return to Malaga we will repeat a pleasure
Typical neighborhood bar a very nice welcome for foreigners super affordable prices and adorable owners I highly recommend for anyone who wants to blend in here 
We went to Malaga for a few days as a group of 5 and we were lucky that the apartment was in front of this place The treatment from the first day was impeccable kindness professionalism and always a smile for the client The food was very good much cheaper than most places around it is 1015 minutes from the city center perfect location Portions with good quantity and tasty food you can tell that it is homemade Very grateful to all the staff and especially to Antonio who always attended to us in a friendly professional and very efficient way We will return to Malaga we loved the city and we will definitely return to this establishment
Good atmosphere to watch the formula one race They have a lot of screens throughout the cafe and will sent out what is most asked for in that room the cafe is kinda divided in sub rooms When we where there there was the race and an important football game and they had both on diverse screens They dont serve food but you are allowed to bring your own and drink are available to order at the bar
Had a great time with the wife Martha here There was a young man Michael I believe his name was had quite the colourful hair Made my dear Martha nervous at first but he was so nice and helpful he put us both right at ease He even helped me find my dentures which I misplaced and forgotten in the bathroom Great and helpful staff and grateful for such a wonderful experience I almost love it as much as my wife
Great place to go for drinks football or dancing Bartender Ishaan makes the best cocktails and its all super reasonably priced Definitely recommend for a fun lively atmosphere and very friendly staff 
St Patricks is so much fun My friends and I go there all the time to hang out for the night All of the people who work there are super nice and helpful especially Haro and Michael They are both really outgoing and answer all of my questions Definitely recommend going to St Patricks
In the bustling St Patricks pub in Valencia I a tall Serbian man walked in with an air of curiosity The sights and sounds were so different from my homeland and the Irish spirit was infectious  I ordered a pint of Guinness and the bartender Barbara served it up with a twinkle in her eye I asked her for a taste of something uniquely Irish and she handed me a plate of shepherds pie saying Its the taste of the Emerald Isle  As I savored the dish a group of lively locals started a spirited Irish dance in the middle of the pub Without missing a beat Barbara handed me a pair of leprechaunsized dance shoes and said Join the fun laddie  I may have been tall but I tried my best to dance like a leprechaun The whole pub erupted in laughter and even I couldnt help but chuckle at my own absurdity In that moment I realized that in this St Patricks pub in Valencia it didnt matter where you came from everyone was Irish for the day and the laughter was universal
Watched the football here last weekend the food was outstanding the atmosphere was electric Barbara was very friendly and seemed to be an extremely efficient and effective worker the like of which Ive never seen All in all one of the greatest days of my life Thank you scholars 
Barbaras service at St Patricks Pub in Valencia was exceptional Her warmth efficiency and local insights made my visit memorable Cheers to a great experience
Went to watch NRL State of Origin game and they put on a special burgerbeer deal Very tasty and efficient  Beer nice and cold with a good price
One of my favorite pub to see football matches in the heart of the city center There are about 10 screens so accomodate yourselves Big matches will be on the main TV  If you are not football fans you can also enjoy the outdoor tables 
Decent pub we went to watch the Irish rugby match They had a big screen and a couple of smaller screens scattered throughout We got a seat but a good few people didnt I would recommend to arrive early if you want a seat when there is a game on The major plus here was that they sold bulmers it was the only pub that I went to that sold it in the city Food was served here although I didnt get any
Very Irish Pub like so quite enjoyable  We didnt eat there as the meals seemed a tad expensive for what what was on offer  The drinks were pretty expensive and the place was a bit noisy   Several different screens had various football or rugby matches playing  Overall the place was nice but didnt knock my socks off
Thank you to Luisa and Nacho for accommodating my request on playing tennis that day and excellent hospitality
NOT an IRISH  bar and NOT a sports bar both which this bar clearly advertises itself under which is very misleading and needs to be addressed  Staff unable to access TV channels to facilitate watching the  Ireland  Rugby World cup game despite stating they would be showing the game when we enquired earlier in the dayHowever in terms of food service and place all was fine
Burger was nice BBQ Bacon Cheese nachos were okay very pricey for quality also had a Guinness which was NOTHING compared to a real guinness Very watered down tasted like a larger wine was disgusting we also had a mojito that was filled with sugar and just tasted like juice wouldnt recommend
Updated  Became friends with local staff and vibe is better then ever All it was before was a bad day for a staff member      I am local Very great food absolutely shocking service Brought half a pint of Guinness and once I asked to fill to the top server got frustrated and said that this is his colleague that did it   Before that 15 min wait table outside Went inside to order myself 2 out of 3 servers are on the phone  Once server brought the full pint confronted with aggressive is this ok now Alrighty then  good opportunity to explore other places for a drink and food too
Very nice ambience with an excellent service  I tried the beer Hop House  Very nice a smooth lager   Very nice place to go for a quick drinks or have a good finger food  Recommended 
Very good place to have a few drinks good music and very pleasant
A place to have some good beers they have a lot of variety The attention is excellent and the place is nice


Sorry didnt sample the food as I was there to watch a Rugby match Owners were busy busy busy but still made time for everyone  Surprisingly  excellent Guinness  and I count myself as an expert Atmosphere was tremendous
We went 2 times to this place  and now never again For first time we took burgers  and it was absolutely awful in fact  never tasted the beef worse than here All of tables are really dirty  we changed 3 times and its always sticky and dirty For second time we had a reservation but reserved table cannot be served without director  waiters do not know nothing about reservations The director is really weird unpolite and rude person  i see here that people expirienced the same with him so we just left the bar Personally i never return to this bar And its not really irish pub but local cheap cerveceria
Love this bar Very friendly staff good amount of alcohol and good pub food A tiny UK in the middle of Valencia  definitely coming back
Great welcome Friendly professional service Best pint of guinness in Valencia Great atmosphere for Ireland vs France Best barman Colin a Dub Best barlady Aisling from Sligo Spanish owner very welcoming
The atmosphere in the bar was very unique stylish and comfortable to spend time in with all the environment quite clean and tidy The cost of some alcohol drinks seemed way too expensive compared to their average price in Valencia valuing at 9 per cup Furthermore from entertainment offerings the bar had nice pool and a football tables within it which are paid apart per each game which made our time in the bar very fun and enjoyable with friends
We came here for some beers and our nachos in the evening before going for a dinner later The staff were very friendly the inside layout was clean cool and comfortable The service was good and they even gave us some complimentary chips while we waited on the nachos Both plates of food were very tasty and really good value We would definitely come back here again  the background music was also spot on really nice
We had a great time here one of the best mojitos we ever had the staff is extremely nice and very very helpful We were so happy with the service we came two night in a row The place is close to the Hemisferic complex and close to many hotels Perfect place to chill and have a drink they have a lot of choices They speak english and the place has affordable prices in average between 2030 lower we have seen in the city center of Valencia Highly recommend
Very friendly and welcoming staff Tasty beer and cocktails always served with crisps or jellies or nuts Great experience overall
Recently opened I think The Stella pint was not great Food was ok but more expensive than other local places and not as nice Staff are good though and worth going to watch a game
They really need to learn how to pull a pint of Guinness Aside from that its a nice bar with good standard bar food
Went in there to watch a Premier league game When entering they said they would play the game After the Valencia game ends they out music on fine it wasnt busy and people enjoyed the music Not only did they not bother putting the game on even with no sound they didnt bother telling us A waste of money and a typical example of a Spanish ownership only wanting to be an Irish pub purely to charge high prices not a great 1st impression tbh Shame as it has potential
Excellent place very good food first class service Great selection of beers Valencia needed it
A great place for a drink and good vibes The staff is always amazing They can get really crowded so keep that in mind and be kind
Nice place for a good beer and watch football
OK it was a Sunday night in mid November so not really busy Both front and back doors where left open so it was very cold but good beer I imagine a great spot in warmer months
Agree with other reviews that this is a copycat EnglishIrish bar selling German and Belgium beer Having said that it had atmosphere and the pint of Pauleners I had was pretty good You could worse if you want something of this genre
Lovely staff food amazing and tasty
A great concert last Saturday and it was free of charge Its nice to have these activities back lets have more
Great place to hang out with friends for a drink and snacks no dinner we had the opportunity to listen to a free concert
Great place Real irish pub and excellent service
Warm place but barmates are dont know speak english
Beer Beer Pizza Terrible Burnt convenience food  Went to Burger King afterwards  yes I was hungry Also not recommended to say the least  Four stars because they were really friendly My mistake thinking you can eat here
I just took s coke but it seems a nice place
Fantastic atmosphere with great selection of beers and spirits food is simple but tasty and prepared well I love visiting this place for the friendly welcome and live events at weekends It is a bit off the beaten track in a predominantly industrial area but very close to Mas Camerena Hotel and Apartamento Wellness Highly recommended
Awesome Nice atmosphere great drinks and amazing food
Very cool placetop
Very good
Brutal
Is this the best place to relax here in manises  and olso unique place have this vista like you are in the cloud   and very good food  trabajadores muy simpticos y muy profesionales no son secos de nada  Im Mohamed from Egypt
Good pub to have some drinks
Its nice  just prices are much higher than in other local bars
Good place to have a draft beer or an excellent cocktail
just saw this bar as we were walking along and called in for a cold one Several different beers on tap and fantastic rock music playing in the background We loved it here although the staff dont speak English nothing was a problem From the great beers wines and really tasty tapas there are so many reasons to call in here and have a great time
This place is the best there is locally Best beer Best music and best people around Its perfect for locals and tourists alike Huge selection of beers and food  Highly recommended
Lovely bar with good atmosphere would really recommend their nights where they have vintage sales and artists selling their art
If you want the feel of an Irish bar in Valencia this one is authentically decorated but with Spanish prices Very nice place to have a drink or two
Not open when they say they would
It is a cocktail bar the truth is that it surprised me the people are very correct and not scandalous We ordered some San Francisco and since they are young quite young they did not serve it correctly for what the 70s drink is they did it their own way wozka and gin and grenadine it was good the truth is that the girl wanted to change it but it tasted bad and I drank it heres the recipe from San Francisco in case someone in their sixties asks for it  San Francisco is a nonalcoholic drink composed mainly of natural fruit juices The recipe calls for orange juice pineapple juice lemon juice and grenadine
We only drank but for the service variety and atmosphere this Irish Pub in Burjassot is worth it recommended
Well we found this typical Irish bar and the truth is that it surprised us for good Good atmosphere with people playing table football The drinks at a good price It is a good place to relax and have a drink
Great barnice tapasand laid back clientele cool live musicand beer choice
Great atmosphere the most welcoming host and delicious food
Fine Guinness for outside of Ireland
Awesome irish pub
Irish pub that isnt open on a Sunday afternoon when football and rugby is on 
Only for watching Real Madrid apparently
Good tapas Hot beer
Unpretentious pub doesnt disappoint
Super chill awesome owner you feel like youre with friends immediately Also lots of choices of brands of gin whisky and other liquorand Foosball Ill be back
I hadnt been there for years but I loved the new touch that the owner has given it Competitive prices
Good place to have a table football and drinks at a good price
Its a very chill pub with fantastic atmosphere
Best place ever for a nice wellserved paint of Guinness or any other beer you prefer   One of the few decades old pub that still allows you to listen to music yet still be able to have a conversation And they also have that same Celtic music live from time to time ask there for updates
Best bar in the city This is a place for people who enjoy their drinks and want quality The best shots cocktails and Guinness pour in Valencia all under one roof
Great live music St Patricks Weekend was awesome 
Guinness good but havent experienced a good atmosphere outside of Saturdays after midnight
Not an authentic Irish pub Bar staff havent a clue how to pour a pint of Guinness properly They will pour it straight from the tap and hand it to you Avoid at all costs if you want a decent pint
Doesnt exactly give a lot of Ireland so it might not be the place for those looking for the authentic Irish experience But as a bar its got great atmosphere friendly staff good food sports on large screens and a good location
I will give it a 4 because it least had Guinness That said it definitely wasnt a full glass not sure if euro 490 is good value as never had Guinness in Spain before No food until 8pm apparently and then only pizza and Nachos I can imagine its good with a crowd on a match day  on a Thursday evening at 7pm its mediocre at best Cannot beat the real Irish pub in Ireland
Terrible no guinness on tap only horrible cans that dont fill a pint glass and over 5  they dont even warn you I caught them pouring the can sacrilegious lovely little irish pub around the corner wicklow Arms
Very friendly service  Good and imaginative selection of bar snacks  Great prices
Nice atmosphere Good beer and food
It really feels Irish The closest in the area anyway Cozy and familiar BasqueIrish
Great guineess
Charming Irishthemed pub with creaky wooden floorboards Good quiet background music Murphys on draught Pinchos and pastries on the counter
Terraceo
Spectacular Irish coffee in 3 different textures From bottom to top Hot Whiskey Tempered Coffee Cold Whipped cream I have never tasted a coffee so good and so delicate for the most exquisite palates A 10 for the waiter
Great place to have a coffee Nice atmosphere fast and attentive service Creamy coffee with a small pastry and a very good omelette
Ok
Amazing

Made a reservation to watch the six Nations with my Irish partner and friends unfortunately the host forgot to write it down and we couldnt enjoy our lunch while watching some good rugby Very disappointing as we were curious on the Irish culture abroad and try a nice pint of Guinness
Very nice lady behind the counter speaks good English and very helpful  the pub is how you would expect it to look like with plenty of dark wood with a lovely feel to it  not a big selection of main meals but definitely worth a visit
This is a large pub in Algorta in the Irish Export style of dark wood and fake adverts Notwithstanding this the pub provides a very decent pint of Guinness as well as Paulaner and other beers They have a good menu and there are 9 tables outside
Friendly welcoming place good selection of food coffee  very drinkablea nice spot for a light lunch time bite
Not good pizza Nice atmosphere
A fantastic Irish pub nice beers
Amazing place different style
Great Irish pub
Any bar dont even think about asking for a coke its terrible not very clean quite neglected Ive stopped going
New management its not called that anymore its called La tavern de Lucifer Good service
The new management has included a variety of local beers
There is new management and I think they give meals for now I dont know more just have a zurito
The best smoothies and cocktails in all of Barakaldo But the best thing without a doubt the owners they are charming
I tried the Pia Colada cocktail and I thought it was spectacular especially considering its good price Also the couple who runs the bar is very nice Recommended to return
A good place to have a cocktail before or after dinner We tried almost all the mojitos and the pina colada and everything was very good We will be back
Great drinks ambient music and the best of Oihanes attention brutal how he put us through it
Nice ambience Seemed like the place where locals would normally go to Weekdays can be quiet but still cozy
Not all the bar staff know how to serve a Guinness well although they do try their best
Spanish Irish pub that has reasonable Guinness and live music but a half a larger can be a bit steep
Good pint of Guinness Great pub food Worth the walk from town centre
Really friendly staff great drink and all round nice experience
Beware All coffee costs 2 Expresso or Latte no difference I am from Bilbao and this is auspiciously unusual and HYPER expensive
Good Guinness but the bar man tried to short change us Said our card didnt work Then gave us Change for 10 euros instead of 20 BEWARE
I used to like this bar Now the staff are so unfriendly especially if youre on the terrace when theyre about to close it
great place to watch and enjoy live performances mostly spanish songs
Great place for a pint of beer and light tapas
Best pub in town
Top 
Great vibe and the bar lady was so friendly and welcoming highly recommend
The best cocktail bar in Bilbao with the best service Here you are served with a smile and the girls behind the bar work very hard to keep everything under control so you can feel nice and well taken care of We highly recommend this bar
 Nice Place  Drinks Cocktails Varieties
Better and superb
Great attention to the public Kindness and dedication Your daily cover is a detail And their pintxos are very delicious A classic
Wellkept pleasant and cleanlooking place Great variety of skewer care and correct treatment Also with covered outdoor terrace  The only downside the doors were open and the temperature inside was not even warm
They always serve you well and she Pinchuleta better go try it
They are very nice They serve and cook wonderfully On Thursdays they serve a very delicious txuleta pintxo The place is cozy and they also have a covered terrace It is understandable that there are always people to have been there for so many years you have to do it well
Good value for money menu Thursday live music
The attention of the staff is impeccable the food is not delicious the following good price for a Sunday and the place is always clean Totally recommended
Excellent food and very good service A very nice place Recommended
Good atmosphere and very good beer
The best cocktails coffees tapas If excellence in hospitality exists I just met it Thanks
Number one
Good atmosphere better service and quality cocktails Without a doubt to repeat
A good place to have some cocktails at a very good price very competitive They have a lot of drinks to choose from which range from 46 We ordered mojitos I didnt quite convince myself of the normal one but the flavor was delicious For the price its not bad at all It is a small bar with a small terrace The attention was very nice We will repeat
Nipped in for a quick drink whilst looking for a pub to watch Athletic Bilbao Goid atmosphere
One of the best cubatas Ive had in Bilbao Good music and exquisite treatment
Beers from the Amstel group very well drawn in the glass It is the first time that an Amstel Oro has been served to me so well The waiter is professional and pleasant They put a lid of nuts with the consumption To repeat There are darts inside the premises and good music Good terrace and low traffic
A charming bar where you can play a game of darts watch a game or have a drink quietly and with unbeatable customer service Furthermore it is one of the bars with the best messes in Bilbo 
Nice atmosphere with good music Friendly and professional staff Regular Guiness Homemade taste Amazing deserts Good qualityprice relation 100 recommended
est Mexican food Ive eaten in Europeat an Irish pub of all places
Amazing food all home made great atmosphere great food and wine pairings and to top it off friendly staff and fantastic service Well be back
Amazing authentic Mexican food The enchiladas with mol are the best Ive ever had Friendly fast service I will be back
Happy Drink
Very correct and close attention from the waiter he never lacks a smile or a good gesture with his customers  Premium drinks prepared and served with care sometimes even with some snacks  Very comfortable to have a drink both inside and on the terrace if the weather is good  To repeat whenever possible
The attention is great and the 80tera music is very good I liked the drinks maybe a little expensive but its worth it The place is somewhat small my advice would be to expand there are only two tables outside to sit it is necessary to improve If you come to Bilbao it is a place you must visit 
I have been there at night and it was very good nothing to see But one afternoon at a party in Barakaldo there were 10 of us and the girl at the bar told us that we could only occupy one table when they were all empty it gave the impression of having a bad day We ordered cubas and some iced coffee certainly poorly prepared they even put milk in the iced coffee Given the girls character and manners we preferred not to say anything to her we did not complain after a while she arrived at the table and began to collect everything without having finished and without saying a word in a very bad manner we will not return that is sure
Great local bar good for practicing your Spanish
I already knew that in Bilbao Gin Tonic is something of a cult what I didnt expect is the level of this very special bar in the heart of Deusto More than 100 different gins in stock 40 on top of a bar that looks splendid with oysters shrimp crabs tortillas and the classic pintxos of bonito salmon and boiled egg from Bilbao What a joy of service and what level of professionalism I will return soon
Well the classic place small and elegant but expensive They call the Sandwiches specialFor 260 they can already be special although not because of their size they have 2 bites and they do arrive The 1906 Beer that I drank was brought out hot and for 350 it could have already been cold All very expensive so it is very possible not to repeat
A traditional bar with its decoration you are transported back to the 70s We only had breakfast The delicious coffee and the good service I dont give it 5 stars because we only had breakfast If it had been a larger or a little longer drink Im sure he would get the 5
We spent Friday night here for a celebration and raffle for a trip to Greece and it was AMAZING We had free drinks and free food all night A must see and must go The workers and owner are amazing Love love love
Karioke night was great Dont know about the food because we didnt eat there
A small but decent bar Friendly staff good atmosphere but very noisy Not the place to go on a Friday night if you wish to converse
Quiet place for an early mornin caf
Most authentic Irish pub outside of Ireland and Ive seen a few Great for catching a Liverpool game
Today we went to Bull McCabes to enjoy a traditional Sunday Roast It was served hot tasty and delicious with fast friendly service We could not ask for more
I love this pub It opens late has a whole array of beers both from bottles and from a tap including guinness And you can play darts and mini football The decor is also very nice and authentic 
Great place Kinda loudy to be able to speak with your pals but good to be honest Main floor has rockpachangeo Downstairs electronic music and less crowded which is my preference xD
Lovely atmosphere if you want to grab a good beer and watch football games this is the perfect place in Zaragoza They have a variety of beers to choose from Tried the IPA and loved it Decent prices and very good location facing the historic walls
As an IrishAmerican I have made it a tradition to visit an Irish pub in every city I visit if possible  I was excited to find Gallagher tucked away in a corner just off of the the Plaza del Pilar  I wouldnt have expected it so close to such a monument but was pleasantly surprised as it wasnt too busy  I ordered a Guinness and a Gallagher sandwich as it is their signature sandwich Great deal on a massive sandwich at only 450 and the Guinness wasnt expensive either  This is a really neat little Irish pub tucked away in an odd spot that is super close to the Plaza del Pilar it felt like a hidden gem  Where most of the restaurants and bars that are within 100m of the Plaza are always busy this was in an odd dead end alley and fairly quiet  Quality food good service and a great atmosphere
Pretty legit Irish pub tucked away behind the plaza fountain Friendly service and monstersized sandwich was delicious
Says open and its not Wanted watch F1 here
I visited on a Thursday for drinks and forr dancing Good service good prices
Nice decorated place and bar lady was really nice great  place to have one for the road
The best irish pub in Zgz Together with Dan O Haras Brilliant atmosphere and staff Great management And dont forget the food 
The best Guinness is here
In few words  Typical Irish Pub low lights sports and beer The staff is friendly and fast Expensive place like all imported beer places And the Guinness is real Guinness  I come here often to have 1 or 2 paints of Guinness or Murphys
Lovely air conditioned bar friendly barman nice pint of Guinness
Irish bartender was pretty rude Scoffed at drink orders and had a really bad attitude during my whole visit
Fun night out
Small but pleasant place good music and a great terrace without much noise although it may not seem like it in the area The fact that you have consumed minimum to pay by card limits access a little but otherwise it is great
Very good drinks and a very good atmosphere We have been around for many years and it never disappoints Keep going like this
Ideal place to have a drink
A place to repeat spectacular drinks and firstclass service We will return again and again
wow a big pleasure to have a draft Chouffe in Spain
Homely English style pub in Zaragoza Friendly staff Clean with music after 8pm Drinks prices fair Double vodka coke 6 euro coke 2 euro Toilets clean Pleasant ambience
My favourite bar in Zaragoza Tremendous ales and helpful staff Highly recommended
Great property English boozer
Spectacular good music the best alcohols and professional service


As soon as I went to the bathroom and saw that it was dirty and full of filth I realized that dinner was going to be accordingly We ordered a sandwich 2 combined dishes which took half an hour to make and a Chinese salad the only Chinese salad it had were some transparent strips I dont know what they were Not recommended
Very friendly staff and normal price The tapas are good and at a good price
For the attention price and small details that make this bar great I recommend it
A great family atmosphere very good treatment of the waiters  I will go many more times
In few words  Biased opinion because this is my Rugby Team Ibero RC pub We come here to drink and dance every match day So I really like it   Otherwise I can tell there are plenty of different beers sport screening and plenty of space to sit or stand or dance Youve got as well darts and futboln  The downside is that the music is very loud after certain hour and it transforms from Pub into Disco style So if you are planning to talk around a pint be aware of late hours The good thing is that it will stay open until 3 am usually Saturdays even more
Great bar Bartender was very good and was okay with playing music my friends and I requested to a point lol Cheap drinks good atmosphere Nice local pub
As always great bar for a drink at  a night out or for a coffee or selection or teas in the afternoon
No food great selection of beers though good place to catch a soccer game
A very cozy place its plants that give freshness its fountain and correct lighting are very well set up It is very good both for dinner and for a relaxed drink The deal of 10
Brilliant I dont give it more stars because there arent any
Incredible It is a beautiful place unbeatable treatment and great prices Super recommended We will return whenever we can
Great food and service but the atmosphere and the staff that serve you is unbeatable Thanks for everything Susana and Maxi
BEST place ever

Lovely late night bar friendly atmosphere 
Africa as it was under colonial rule Good vibe The Nordes Gin  Tonic is as good as you can get No pinxtos or food though
Its a nice place to watch sports The beer is a little too expensive but the atmosphere is great
Really nice place and the staff are friendly but its too expensive  Over 7 euros for a whisky
Brutal
Great atmosphere
One of the best bars in Zaragoza and the best in Utebo 100 recommended A place that you have to be very entertaining
The only remaining pub in Utebo that I know of Good atmosphere wooden decoration and current varied music
Good classic cocktails for 85
Gin Tonic
They dont have reference beer The only one they have is brown amber and they pour it as if it were cider There you
Pleasant atmosphere to have drinks well served
A place not to return As soon as we entered we asked for a bucket but we didnt have a table and no money and they kicked us out We asked for a claim form and they grabbed us pushed us and threw us into the street They say that we just come to fck Terrible treatment I do not recommend to ANYONE
Im going with my partner Upon entering we were treated well We sat at a high table with two stools The music is Latin and the DJ varies it The place is small and with little dance floor But when we had been there for about 2530 minutes and had finished the first round a waiter I suppose the manager comes to us and tells us that he is going to take our table  come on he will kick us out he will throw us out table are for cubes many people at tables that do not have cubes And he brings a group of 3 girls who stand next to us He doesnt even ask if we want to drink anything else Regrettable Obviously we left not to return
A great atmosphere and the best cocktails
It is my favorite bar Mr I feel like I am at home and with harmony and good treatment It is what is worth the treatment of the owner I will not change that bar for another place

The best of Murcia Rock and beer and drinks And good vibes you always make friends
We went in around 1230am after Sting concert Only one girl working but she did a great job in serving a thirsty postconcert crowd Very fair prices
Check it out Great atmosphere and great customer service
Nice bar in the center of Murcia where you can have a drink or beer in a pleasant atmosphere There are tables both inside and on the terrace
A place for beers and cubatas with a good atmosphere and pints at a reasonable price for the area in which it is located Keep in mind that most tables are high You also have the bar option  It is not usually crowded during the week it is very quiet and with a pleasant decoration to the eye  They serve you at the table and are usually attentive
Food here is always spot on Ate here twice Fish and chips steak and ale pie both lovely Drinks are reasonable About 33 for 2 mains and 4 cokes Cant argue 
Do you miss England This is your place Do you want to experience an English pub This is your place too since all the customers and servers are English tooI just went for drinks Guinness and John Smith Service was great The food I saw looked amazing and homemade
We went on a Sunday night and there was a turn on who was a good singer played some good songs and had a bit of banter with the punters Then they had karaoke on which was a bit of fun wasnt taken too seriously Decent prices for the area on drinks and measures pretty good on spirits Definitely go again if we come back to Magaluf next year
Best live music place in magaluf and around Most places advert as live music every night but this pub does Great vibe and staff Never seen before staff playing excellent music violin and later just behind the bar Always a warm welcome here Good place for people above certain age to have a great night out
Has been renovated and under new management Fabulous place to have a drink fair prices and chillgood music For beer lovers they offer at least 20 different beer brands from all over Europe
One of the best places in Palma to have some drinks  listening good music and with a really good ambiance  Toni the owner is so good and all the drinks are high quality what else
Irish pub quite  nice
Really cozy place with very good ambient music and a wide variety of national and international beers  Unbeatable attention from Toni who always has a kind word patience and education that makes you feel at home  In the best place in Coll and Ciudad Jardn
Very nice place to sit and eat Food is very good and music is more rock then hardrock caf
Tasty beer friendly personnel But the kitchen a little bit simple Despite the fact good place to drink
A pub with good live music and good beers Service was Amazing Inaki served us the whole time He was always in a good mood very helpful always had a smile on his face He gave us very good information about Mallorca We came as strangers and left as friends I am very grateful for a wonderful evening
The best place to have a good time I went on a Saturday night the live music started at about 1130PM and it was  Best rocklive music experience ever Crowd is a mix of tourists and locals
In all honesty as a Scottish person this place is amazing Warren and Kath are the most sincere people for a Scottish pub in Spain nevermind Magulaf the hospitality is amazing and the people are so welcoming the drink is cheap and the atmosphere is well Scottish highly recommend for a few nights in the town beach is 5 mins away Definitely worth the time for Scottish folk and tourists
Such a great location and great people Were so happy to have found this pub on the second day of our vacation been here every day since Lovely atmosphere If were coming back to Magaluf this is definitely going to be our go to location Lots of love to you guys 
Amazing place with a lovely atmosphere Felt very welcome and at home Both couples that run it are lovely
Love this place Great vibes and amazing hosts Thank you Warren  Kath 
We came here to see football game and to of course to have a couple of Guinness pints We ordered American burger which wasnt that good not home made and enchiladas which wasnt that good as well The portions are so big we didnt finish our food and the prices are very fair The staff were very nice and welcoming but thats the case in the places we visited in Spain I love those people
We had an amazing Lennox house cocktail and aperol spritz both of them were well prepared The service was fast and pleasant Nice terrace in the heart of Palma
It looked nice if a bit sterile on arrival We didnt stay so we cant give it star ratings The reason we didnt stay was a bottle of larger was 5 and another bar close by that also showed the football charged 280
I really enjoyed my time here Immediately as we entered we were greeted by friendly staff The service was really quick the girl on her first day there was super nice The Guinness was great as well as the food We definitely enjoyed our stay and will come again
very friendly bar great people spent a week in there 2 years running roll on next year
Staff are very welcoming and food and drinks were fantastic
Cracking Bar the staff are always really friendly and helpful  The atmosphere is always lively too
Lovely little pub tucked away in a corner great friendly atmosphere and live music some evenings As a Somerset boy the cider selection is poor but that is the same everywhere in the area due to price rises but there are some nice bottled beers and good selection of wines spirits and cocktails Prices are reasonable Rest assured you will feel very welcomeAnd there is a pool table 
Love it nice place to be
A MUST on Malle   Top pub with super nice service and great guests   The Klsch and the meatball were super tasty   Thank you very much for a great fun afternoon
Best Kolsch pub on the island BigRon and Simone is a must Live Colonia
Cult pub on Malle and a must for every FC fan Good Klsch and a good atmosphere However a wellfilled lid isnt cheap either great for watching football 
Good bar went there to watch the football had a great night service and drinks were good
Fabulous bar mega cold  Guinness and strongbow on draft fabulous for watching sport pool table and dart  board the PNG the place to be
Friendly english run barpool quiz nights all sports on screensgreat place run by lovely ppl
Lovey bar in a great location Staff are extremely friendly and welcoming Drinks are cheap with very generous pours Thought we would only end up having one drink and moving on but we kept finding ourselves being drawn back night after night and despite it being an English bar it has some of the best Guinness Ive ever had abroad Be sure to ask about splitting the G if you want a good time 
Sindisis now called Shelbys and it has had a serious upgrade  Great atmosphere  lots of Sports TVs very fair and reasonable prices Was here the day Liverpool  beat Manchester United 7  0Loved it
One of the best pints of Guinness outside Ireland
Unattentive staff had to wait to pay for 10 minutes Nice location to meet people from all over the world good atmosphere food is good and quickly served proper pub food They called me a taxi after I waited five more minutes without being noticed Good place to go to for sport watching  if you have time and patience 
The very best empanadas with meat and raisins in town very hard to find on Mallorca For reservations they are very responsive even respond via WhatsApp 
Amazing place owner is an a great person Had a great conversation about football even though we support different clubs he we agreed on everything about football The breakfast is perfect especially the tattie scone weve all ordered extra I would recommend this place to everyone whos visiting Palma Nova
Brilliant bar great food and drinks We have been going there since we 1st went to Palmanova in about 2000 which was a couple of years after they opened  Its still the same great bar and the owners are chatty and friendly Oh and the Guinness is topnotch
Best place to be great breakfast great friends place staff are brilliant
Good view of the beach Nice food we visited a couple of times for breakfast and lunch The Cajun chicken wrap was amazing One of the woman who served us was a bit door faced mind you and put us off going back She came across quite rude Not sure if it was just us but by the looks of the reviews from other travellers it maybe isnt us thats the problem No manners whatsoever The Scottish guy Steve was lovely and the other girl with dark hair was lovely too We would walk by to see if that member of staff was in working if she we wouldnt go in and head somewhere else
Busy Buzzy Place Called inform a drink Lucky to get a seat Bustling  bar Owner there keeping  an eye on his team and customers Great to see many locals here always a good sign Had 2 drinks here as we were trying  out some places in this area Dont let the big sign  Heineken fool you they do not serve it on tap  Musical  instruments hanging from ceiling Quiet a dark bar Busy outside area off main road
Great music and good range of drinks
The security guys on the doors of Molly Malone  need a good kick up the hole Turning people away from the premises by saying it full when truly isnt full with only a few people inside surly isnt good for business I think the owners of Molly Malone need to review there security doorman and why they turning paying customers away from there doors I wouldnt give them a star but to post this review I had to give one
Nice decor bar was a bit slow has darts and pool which was nice bathrooms are downstairs the place was also very clean overall
Possibly my new favourite Irish pub in the world and God knows Ive been in a few Lovely creamy pints of Guinness and the food was excellent Enjoyed it so much on our first night in Palma that we came back daily Friendly staff and great music Highly recommended by this Irish man
We reserved a table to watch Formula 1 and they have plenty of TVs and tables so you can watch it from different angles The beer was cold and perfect the people who work here were very nice and friendly I have no complaints with the food it was good and just as I imagined it to be Highly recommend if you want to watch sports and have a great time sharing moments with friends
Probably the best Irish Pub in town
What a great place Gorgeous woodwork imported from Ireland very friendly staff NFL and EPL going at the same timeperfection  The Buffalo wings are amazing and the burgers massive as they are cannot be beat We got to have a few quick words with the ownersboy do they work hard to make sure every single person is happy and well taken care of Best sports barIrish barrestaurant I have ever enjoyed
We went here for a couple of drinks Didnt have food Connor served us when we arrived He is an asset to the business He was excellent We had very good service and a bit of craic He even predicted some requests It was reasonably priced too A bit out of the way and only heard about it from someone staying in our hotel
So glad we found this gem of a place Friendly staff and food excellent Prices reasonable Fish and chips and Thai green curry are highly recommended Check it out when you next visit Palma Nova
Me  my husband went to watch the arsenal v PSV footie game But sadly when we sat down at a table outside my husband realised that they were gonna put the man utd game on So when the waiter bought out our drinks my husband said r u showing the Arsenal gameCause if not we needed to go else where to watch the game So he must of said to his boss  then came out to say that they can put that game on the tv inside So we went inside It was a nice atmosphere We felt at home And the drinks were a reasonable price The staff were very welcoming and accomdating to us We had a fab time there Would recommend a visit to this bar We had a fab nght And even better Arsenal won 40 Thanks ONeils for your hospitality Karen  Paul Pallen
We chose fish and chips as we had tried it before and it was good This time half the portion of chips were overfried chip bits and cold Definitely not as good as before A shame very disappointing
Called Saturdaydecent pint not too bad prices either Just a shame how quiet magaluf is on a warm Saturday afternoon
Ways more better Paella negra than on an other restaurant directly to the sea 
Perfect sports bar with good food and nice service
would not be in a hurry back  paella was ok but not great
The ladsowners of Irish Corner Bar were great craic and made me feel very welcome I enjoyed my time in the bar and I would recommend any tourist to Palma to visit the bar and enjoy a drink or two
This bar is owned  runned by two leprechauns Owen  Tony from the very core of the great isle of Ireland Limerick They even speak leprechaunic True story Great little cornernest they created with amazing regulars which make all welcome If you skip this haven you cant say you ever visit San Agustin Skl
Fab place Put the Historic Newcastle v PSG match on for us  thanks Owen Made our day
Great place very friendly owners Youll feel at home here Also the best prices in Palma trust me 
Went here specifically because they serve Guinness and was not disappointed Great Guinness great tequila and great company The bar has a delightful atmosphere and he played a good selection of music too Highly recommended
The best bar in the area Good prices big measures and a warm welcome this bar made my holiday Highly recommended
Great Scottish run bar Gerry and Pauline are a good laugh Good prices for the measure and most importantly the guiness is spot on Made our week long holiday that bit more enjoyable Has an American pool table and foosball table as well Will definitely visit again next time on the island
Highly recommend this place if youre in the area Here the owner is cheekyfunny and you know youre getting alcohol in your drinks Great vibes great playlist Theres a pool table and lots of seating Reasonably priced drinks Super glad I came here 
Very friendly staff Emerson the Brazilian security was very helpful he helped us what places and beaches we should visit Very polite and care about all of the customers Adrian the waiter very educated kind with everyone Also helpful with all of the customers Really lovely to meet this guys Prices are acceptable Had a really nice caipirinha Me and my partner loved this place Highly recommend this place Outstanding
Morgans at Magaluf is such a friendly bar The staff are extremely nice and amazing Lucinda made our experience extra special and we had the best time They have reasonable priced drinks and very nice atmosphere Super good place to start your night and plays good football match mon the Scots And Steve Clark even when its not in magaluf season Morgans pub is the best place for us to go 1010 recommend  x
We absolutely love Morgans  Its the best place Jose is a legend Lucia makes a cracking double vodka red bull  The best in magaluf
Brilliantly priced Very accommodating we requested an event on the tv and they put it on for us with no problems Lovely hospitality and a welcoming place
We had food here three days in a row because the food was excellent Stefan the chef is wonderful at his job he makes delicious food Grinne the manager is a lovely friendly lady and interacts really well with the customers Alan the barman is excellent at his job very hardworking and has a great manner with customers Parris the waitress was so helpful with local information and is also brilliant at her job Its a beautiful bar with very reasonable prices
Excellent food friendly  attentive service great pricing We dropped by mid afternoon to a friendly welcome and rapid service from the team A welcome better value  taste alternative to the quayside Portals venues
The bar is very well kept the range and quality of the food is fantastic the prices are very reasonable especially considering its prime location on the main street Service provided by the waiters was very good Well worth a visit if your in Portals or the surrounding areas
Nice sports barrestaurant away from the beach Considering the location a bit too expensive Unfortunately the bartender wasnt very attentive and preferred to hide in the back of the bar But ok not a big problem
This is an Irish bar in name only Poorly trained staff that tend to chat together rather than concentrate on the clientele Useless is probably the best compliment available Absolutely poor  A couple of stupidly drunk Irish lads allowed to spoil other peoples evening because they were buying lots of shots This bar is an embarrassment and most definitely not Irish
Greasy food brought in from another location Waiter very laid back smoking a spliff Music very loud and discourages people from sitting inside in the shade Toilets are up two flights of stairs no facilities for disabled This is not an Irish pub Service and facilities not fit for 21st century hostelry Prices are exhorrbitant Owners milking the business in their final season
Place could definitely do with a clean because its meant to be old irish pub it doesnt mean it cant be cleaned Dusty and grubby dirty glasses left on tables for almost an hour sticky tables insects on a bar
Unbelievably poor service The lady who served me was abrupt and rude No please or thank you halfway through my order she walked off and missed the rest which I had to repeat  The next time I went to the bar she wouldnt serve me as I wasnt stood directly on front of her next to the til even though there were no issues with wherever anyone else was standing Even when the man pointed out I was next she called out no no no you must form a line So we left to spend our money elsewhere  This was on the first day of our holiday which was a shame as if the service was any good we would have called in each day and we were saying the Melia Hotel about 5 mins walk away  Avoid at all costs
We had a 3 day trip to Alicante and ended up in here every evening after dinner as we stayed around the corner  Fast service nice wine  in desperate need of new toilets 
Place is good music very loud we cant talk  we dont like very loud music but if you like it its a nice place Staff was good too very welcoming
This is the worst place in Alicante dont waste your time Waiters doesnt want to attend  We had to ask for 5 times to order but they didnt even come to ask  Clearly they dont want to work and maybe their boss doesnt pay them One with curly hair guy was talking l
Ok so this place is really located next to lucernos tram The outdoor seating is nice but the waitresses are to say the least lazy Went to the toilet and no toilet seat I wouldnt come back again
Great pub went there to watch the Rugby 
As an Irish person I am not happy that this pub calls itself Irish the total opposite No atmosphere no Irish decor no Irish music and an ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING bathroom Total disgrace would not return Drinks were ok but this place is filthy and the opposite of what you get at home
The bar is anything buy Irish  a nice enough bar pretty dark on in the inside but some seating area outside which was nice
Generous alcohol measures Fair prices Pleasant staff Nice outside seating areas Use this place quite often
The only think Irish about it is the name and the fact they sell Guinness  the food is very good and the staff friendly and helpful but if you want to top your feet to irish music then in my opinion by pass
Really nice pub with a good selection of drinks and great sandwiches Enjoyed our Saturday afternoon here and well try to come back again
We were there and in this pub you got no any food You can drink mediocre beer there without any food Better other place next time
It felt reasonably authentic for an Irish pub in Spain quick friendly service
The waitress was lovely and very professional  She made us feel very welcome  Very reasonable prices too
Great place to sit when your wife and kids are shopping in the gran Via shopping center Guinness is bottled dont have it on draught but its still good Managed to get 5 bottles down me in a 45 minute session Snacks with each bottle and friendly staff Comfy chairs and looks like it gets great fun at night in normal times Was very clean and witnessed the staff cleaning seats and tables with disinfectant after every customer I seen leave
Not for my age group no food and not a Irish person in sight more like a Spanish interpretation of a Irish bar there were people doing shisha must be a part of Dublin Ive never been
Had breakfast this morning at this pub which was a bad experience Besides that the coffee was awful the bread with tomatoes and ham seemed to be over due the expiring date The waitress was rude and obviously still was drunk from the previous night Seriously Id never go back there for any food
Good service good choice of beers nice music Perfect chill place
Me encanta
Good place to drink something Despite a bit off due to two issues I hope hes better when he comes back  I liked that they hire young and not mature people I hope they treat them well and have good resources for them  A big greeting We repeat for his good character I expect good treatment from them
Wide range of gins whiskeys rums ciders cocktails coffees teas and beers Good service clean and tidy place on a hot day the ac was on and we were comfortable inside the premises I have come on several occasions and there are offers with beers on a pay 2 and drink 3 plan in pints of good brands I will come again for sure what I would like is for them to add things to snack on it would give a lot more game and we would surely stay longer
Best bar and barman in Alicante Only place to watch the GAA with multiple TVs Big G is a legend and shows any sport not just the GAA He even opened the bar 5 hours early one day so I could watch the Premier League Get yourself in for a slap of drink if in Alicante 
Beautiful creamy pint good music great service  all the sports you could want shown on the three TVs
Cockroaches crawling on the bar beside your beer and your feet on the floor I dont think this is the place that sells fresh quality beer  They also should have a much bigger selection of Irish whiskey compared to the low quality whiskey from Scotland which has nothing to do with Ireland as Irish whiskey is far superior  Lovely owner by the way and a gentleman  Maybe the place can be improved in the future
A proper Irish bar in Alicante the owner was so welcoming and he even put the Liverpool match on for us Its a must visit if you are in Alicante
I think it is a typical bar in San Vicente with an Irish appearance but it hasnt convinced me in the least The Irish coffee I ordered the cream was from a bottle everything full of sugar bad whiskey from Mercadona or similar and the glass pffff nah if you want an Irish like in Ireland forget it but for watching football and a beer perfect no Irish music and stuff like that come on its fine but its not for me
Good place to go have a beer and a bite to eat Nice quiet and good prices I recommend 100x100
I loved Excellent atmosphere you can talk Good attention The only bad thing is the difficulty to park but the place is super good
A good pub with a wide variety of beers a large terrace and table football Excellent attention
A great pub our drinks were often served with complimentary nuts crisps and sweets which was greatly appreciatedStaff were always polite and attentive
We had drinks they were okay the atmosphere very well
Nice drinks and nice staff but as other commenters have said  is this supposed to be an Irish bar Cromwell murdered hundreds of thousands of Irish people and dispossessed many more So the name needs to be changed Gracias
A nice pub with a good beer selection and a nice terrace Errr the only thing though is the name Oliver Cromwell was a butcher who murdered an enormous number of Irish people Are those who gave this pub this name aware of that
The place is really cool wooden walls and mosaic lamps it creates a perfect atmosphere It has a big barrel of peanuts in the center for everyone to serve for free and it offers live music from time to time and jams every friday I really enjoyed it and definitely will come back
Best pub in town even in out of holidays period  Great live music fun and friendly atmosphere in a very beautiful pub
Nice Bar Live music and karaoke open mic Perfect for me
Cool place with a live music good price for alcohol Friendly atmosphere
Would of been 5 star but didnt like the constant rock music Bar tender is friendly and chats with customers Sells wide range of drinks including a lot of British favourites and is a cross between USA and Irish Cheap cheerfull and well worth a visit
We spent a month in Alicante and found The Duke the first week We frequently went and had Hispanic beer doble IPA Not cheap but the staff was great especially Bexaida and we really enjoyed the vibe Highly recommend
We really enjoyed our time here Alba was especially friendly  
Great and cozy place with a wide set of drinks
I did asked for the drinks options like cocktails and the guy it says there isnt one but my friend order a cocktail and she was servedso a bit confusing Also smiles are free but they didnt have one
Good service child friendly and quality drinks
It was nice and the people working there especially Jose was warm and welcoming
Supercalifragilisticoespialidoso
Nice place good irish pub for a beer
definitely not Irish Spanish run Spanish beer and no English football
Not really Irish only two known drinks
Nice beer
The waiter ignored us every time we tried to get his attentionTo the point of turning his back whenever you tried to get his attention Drinks were brought without the complimentry  snacks other reviews commented were given but every other table was given them The food looked nothing like the photos on the menu tasted ok Every item was slammed on the table when it finally arrived everything arrived haphazardlyI can only Compare it to being served at Faulty TowersNothing like an Irish bar at all I WOULD AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE  very disappointing However was very prompt in bringing the bill Did get a thank you when we paid
Irish pub Guiness aprons But they havent got Guiness what a joke Nuff said
Very nice bar to stop off at when in Arenalasexcellent Irish beer and a good atmospherealthough I didnt try the food I must say it looked very appetising and a lot of local people were eating there So say no more
Quite a nice little bar with a terrace in the sunshine Nice beer and as other people have said they give you nice nibbles a bit like quavers which Ive quite missed I have no idea why its called an Irish bar except for the fact that they sell Guinness Plus an Irish bar doesnt really fit in in this resort
Great atmosphere great music and lovely staff
Live music and nice to sit outside
Good beers on tap
What a cracking night
Of course I will not return the service and treatment of customers is disastrous the waitress criticizes the customers with other customers making them drunk and insulting them Of course I will not return and all my friends will not return either especially with those types of professionals
Good place in the center of Alicante to enjoy good company Very well decorated and a lot of different drinks One of our favorite places 
As always the best PUB for drinks Always attentive and friendly Thats why we come back
A very nice place to have a drink with some friends The waiter Felipe is very friendly and helpful and served us very well
Great atmosphere  But bad service
Not an Irish Bar at all
Good Beer It has a pooltable darts and tablesoccer They open during the afternoon and evening But its pretty dark inside Service was nice too
Love the music but didnt have cocktail and I didnt drink anything
Have passed by and even attempted to go here many times over the last 2 to 3 years and it never appears to be open  Opening times on Google Maps would be a massive help
Reading the reviews I see that people rave about the quantity and quality of liquors whiskey and even coffees that you can find But the truth is that I have not tried the above but yes the beers And they serve them in an almost sublime way Colder than the good days of a civil guard So if you feel like having one there you wont regret it
Incredible whiskey museum there are invaluable collection bottles The owner is a person full of good stories that brightened up my stay in Alicante Thanks a lot Ill be back
Very nice Pub but during my visit the beer taps were broken I will come back another time
Great bar staff and great drinks Would recommend highly
Best bar in Alicante shout out to Martin and divot mainly divots friend
Very good drinks and food and best owner
Great service manager changed my wifes drink as she wasnt happy with it no qualms no issues the staff were very friendly
The selection of beers  in this pub was just amazing Loved the BLANC beer which is really sweet and has around 56 alcohol  They also offer pizza  which is just a frozen pizza but after couple of beers it is amazing  Cheers 
Nice place really has that old english pub feel The music is mostly rock which is cool Upstairs they also have a pool table which you can reserve before you come They also have a great beer selection from internationally known beer to local Slovenian beer The pub offers alot of food options Altogether a great experience being in this pub
Just what it says  it has an old pub feel You come here to have a drink with friends grab a bite and feel cozy about it  By the way they offer some snacks like hot dogs fried chicken breasts sandwiches and Ill say they are all surprisingly good and well priced  For a lunch at work or a toast with friends this place has what it takes
This place offers a wide range of exotic beers Staff is great communicating with just the right amount of humor   Would be nice if they manage to get a few more parking lots
A nice bar with a wonderful atmosphere and good music They have many types of beers to choose from Despite the crowd the service was fast and friendly We love these types of bars and this one really convinced us and we enjoyed it a lot
Great pub good price for food and drink As crazy as it sounds the restrooms are unique
Wouldve been really nice to spend an evening there and try out some different beers but we waited for 1520 Minutes on a Monday but never got service The waiters have been walking around all the time but not even greeting us You could see that the table next to us which has been sitting there a bit longer got really frustrated too
Great bar Slightly crowdy but the staff is professional Best music I will definitely recommend my friends to try it instead of Parlament bar  During the day I recommend a coffee Very high quality Also I have to compliment the kindness of bartenders Very kind people
not very good experience it was very noisy it didnt smell good inside service and drinks were not very good quite different experience than true english pubs I suppose it is better outside
Rude rude rude i only wanted to watch the rugby world cup i would rather miss it than watich in this hole
Old fashioned english drinking pub Perfect for watching football game with friends If they find a parking
Good fun pub with decent prices and good beer selection
My new favorite pub in Slovenia Largest in the country with over 1000 drinks My host Marco Cesar a 19 year veteran of the establishment provided outstanding friendly hospitality during a recent midday visit The Hop Brew selections are worth a try for those who like craft beers
Very nice little pub We were there to late to try the food I bet it good
Ok pub for having a beer or few Relatively slow service during busy hours even with full staff
Feels a bit tired overall but the low rating is mainly due to the on tap wine option I know its not a wine bar but serve a njce crisp clean and cold wine from a bottle not fizzed up from a tap
The star rating depends heavily on your expectations Are you looking for a loft style craft beer spot Well wrong address Are you feeling like chilling out listening to classic rock while sipping on plain light lager bought for the best price in town This is the place for you
Ol rusty Levstik could be a true pub but sadly it is a farcry of its mission Staff doenst look very interested in their job and places cries for some maintenance so tourists are unfortunately avoiding it But idea about such pub is in right place
Small pub but has outdoor seating under umbrellas and pints for 240 what more could you want
Great pub at a great location Union beer at only 420 for 1L Excellent price Staff were friendly and helpful Great service Would most definitely recommend
A striking and well known bar designed for families with kids Peaceful and stylish ambinet for spending quality time with friends
Great place to have a drink either outside big garden with childrens playground or inside Besides coffee they offer a decent selection of sloveninan craft beer You can also have a snack like a toast or smth similar A bit expensive coffee though for example capuccino 2 eur  Small childrens playground on the site  Nice
Fast delivery good ambient and friendly staff My recomendation
The staff is kind The ambience outside is really nice inside not so much a bit too dark and crammed The prices could be a bit lower Items are a bit overpriced The coffee is good We ordered tea as well And asked for more hot water just water and they said they would need to pay for the water as if we ordered another tea The tea costs I think around 4 EUR  They also have parking space
I had an absolutely fantastic time at Sir Williams Pub in Ljubljana From the moment I walked in I could feel the vibrant and welcoming atmosphere that this pub exudes The cozy yet lively ambiance created the perfect setting for a memorable evening  The menu at Sir Williams Pub was a delightful surprise With a wide selection of beverages and mouthwatering dishes there was something for everyone The pub truly excels in offering both classic favorites and unique specialties all prepared with care and attention to detail  The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive adding to the overall positive experience Their knowledge about the menu and their willingness to go the extra mile for their customers truly stood out  One thing that I particularly appreciated was the pubs commitment to quality Whether it was the perfectly poured drinks or the wellprepared dishes it was evident that Sir Williams Pub takes pride in what they serve  The live music added an extra layer of enjoyment to the evening It was the perfect backdrop to relax and unwind with friends or simply soak in the energetic atmosphere  If youre in Ljubljana and looking for a pub that offers great food excellent service and a lively ambiance I wholeheartedly recommend Sir Williams Pub Its a place where you can create wonderful memories and savor the best that the city has to offer
This is such a fantastic bar with the absolute best service we found in Ljubljana Immediately we felt so comfortable here and the bartender was just perfect he knew exactly what he should recommend us and was very knowledgeable We never had to wait or ask for anything but were also not bothered all the time I wish we could have just sat here all day and night while we spent the weekend in town but you know we had to get that mandatory Lake Bled pic Highly recommend this pub for all visitors in town
If you want to drink the beer then this is the place If you are a passionate lover of beer you will appreciate this pub It really is a House of beer as they call it Every day there is 14 options of beer and thats just on tap If they ran out of one dont worry they will just replace it with another option This is the place where you come and enjoy the beer in all its glory and thats it Everything else is just extra plus for this place Owner Marko is passionate about this place have a great knowledge of beer makes this place feel like youre at home in your living room Its not a big space its cozy place where locals go to get some good feeling wheatear thats in the morning drinking first or fifth coffee of the day or drinking beer after long day The interior is classic pub decorated with clean toilets different options for some snacks and of course lots of other options for drinks But as I said this is a House of beer and it certainly delivers to its name If you visit Ljubljana and LOVE beer you must visit this place 
A pub like no other Small and cozy with great selection of beers Owner is a beer connoisseur that kindly offers to recommend the right beer for your taste Professional service 1010
Hidden bar for quiet coffe away from tourists
Nice little bar hidden from the main street  Unfortunately at the time of our visit the beer selection was scarce and they did not serve the ones they were promoting  Otherwise I would recommend it for a quiet sit down
As a dog owner of a larger dog there are very few places that would accept entrance of a large dog inside This place is an exception and a great one it is Great coffee the owners are very friendly you can even grab a bite toast sendwich Has free WIFI water for the pets and some dog treats Welcome and enjoy your stay
1010 Great wines and beers Came here twice
Awesome place Very sylish  Great for company  
My favorite pub for morning tea afternoon beer and evening whisky  with always smiling waitresses 
Nice place lots of beers nice staff good prices Nice selection of whisky
Prices are high for such a location Garden is in the shade so its a nice place for beer during the summer Some waitresses are ok while some are really confused Depends on what day you visit I suppose
Extra friendly staff Great music I highly recommend 
Relaxed friendly wait staff
Very relaxed and friendly staff Ill be back
Everything is OK Friendly staff owners cooling in the garden taken care of
I went here for a beer and felt welcome right away Service was good and people started chatting with me 
Hodden bar in city center with good price
My regular coffee place with outside sitting and sun in winter and shade in summer 
Tasty coffe Quick and profesional service
This bar is always crowded no matter what time of the day is it even though its in a secluded area Loved the menu card had such a fun vibe to it Staff are helpful had a great experience Moscow Mule was the best
A lovely place to get a drink Great prices and I highly recommend homemade ginger lemonade The personell is friendly and didnt complain about my girlfriend being undecided as always Its situated on a sunny corner overlooking picturesque streets of Ljubljana and a church It is a popular place for hippies so expect a smell of weed every now and then
great new place away from the crowd waiters are polite and friendly interesting mixes and wine selection I was pleasantly surprised by their matcha tea made with pure powder and unsweetened almond milk which is a rare find
The waitress passed our table more than 10 times didnt even say hi to us Waited for 20 minutes to get completely ignored Would understand if the place was crowded but it really wasnt Never been so disappointed
The staff here was not that friendly we didnt really feel welcome  We had to wait a bit to get our food which is normal We ordered the American pancakes a burger and some fries The fries are frozen but the first time we ordered them they were actually surprisingly really very good So we ordered them again and the second portion was not nearly as good as the first one They forgot to salt it and it was not prepared the same way They should have some consistency in preparing the frozen french fries I think  The burger was not bad but the BBQ sauce was extremely overpowering the rest of the flavors in the burger So the only thing you can really taste is the super sweer BBQ sauce Its not a bad sauce there was just too much of it The cheese slice was not melted and there was not enough salad in the burger The bun was great tho Amaizing  The American pancakes they were ok Extremely sweet and the texture was not that good I had better ones before The strawberries were nice and fresh but the candies on the pancakes were not good They had a very cheap taste
The burgers were decent but served cold and bacon was hard to chew otherwise this could be a 4 star review The amercian pancakes are great though and they offer interesting combinations
Rockn Roll themed burger joint in a mall does too little to stand out Serves typical diner food from wings to pancakes There is an emphasis on beer offerings which are vatied and the drinks list is large enough to satiate every taste  We had a Cobain and Hendrix burger with fries and house dipping sauce The server asked us how we wished our burgers prepared and we opted for medium rare because we are not savages The food was good there are plenty of napkins nothing outstanding but good qzality dining The bill came out at 30 for two burgers one fries w sauce a 7up one lemonade with elderberry a lime water and tap water We were thirsty boys
Beautiful food and chilled atmosphere The only thing that let my food down was that the avocado was too mashed whereas I would have preferred it a bit thickerhave a bit more substance  The waiter although lovely and I dont know if this is a Slovenian thing because Ive noticed it quite a lot seemed a bit like they were boreddidnt want to be there our water was nearly thrown down on the table But to be fair it was a heavy bottle Wouldnt stop me going again Really really enjoyed it  My partner got the burger and chips The chips were amazing they were like scoops But nothing to scoop Should have had coleslaw or something 
I visited this place with my young daughter and a Slovenian friend when we were on our vacation in Ljubljana Sadly we experienced great rudeness from one of the waiters  The waiter was very rude and grumpy towards my daughter who asked for help with a choice between two drinks That was already a bad sign however after hearing us talk in our national language he was openly racist toward us saying how we are in Europe now so we should behave by speaking our language and acting civilized  Unfortunately such racist and chauvinistic behavior should not be welcome in such a beautiful place as that was very humiliating rather than welcoming
I went here twice during my visit to Ljubljana It is excellent to have a wide variety of craft beer selections on tap Toeno pivo in an area where most restaurants only have one option for tap beer  The views on the river are fantastic as you can see the Romanstyle market columns as well as the water  Both times I went the service was extremely quick compared to other places and the waiters were very kind and polite I cant recommend a better place to have a couple beers in Ljubljana than here
Pub with Slovenian and other craft beers in the center of Ljubljana The beer could have been a little colder Both the Session IPA and ALE were average but the atmosphere and service were great
Overpriced drinks Local biers at EUR 5 given the cost of goods and salaries in Slovenia the bar makes extremely good margins Service is horrible with not enough and unpersonal waitresses who do not know the products they seljl They were just unable to explain me the different local craft beets they have on the menu A rude bar tender who would not give help Just a tourist trap difficult to escape in this nice area Unfortunatelyfor friendly service you might need to leave Ljubljana
The bas thing is thay had small beers only 
In the night a small discotheke type of bar 7 euros entry Nice atmosphere if you like Slovenian hip hop Carnaval
The strawberry mixed drink and the one with ginger were both refreshing and strong They were best mixed drinks I have ever had I would visit again 
Pleasant place although its by the main sreet staff was friendly coffee was ok
Nice and pleasure morning espresso with autumn Sun view onLjubljana castlenot too hot not coldand good caffe
Lovely coffee and nice atmosphere High chairs and door entrance is suitable for disabled people They also have internet available Very friendly stuff which can make you lough and put you in a good mood They have Guinness on a tap and staropramen beer
Nice location in the centre Nearby is national museum and Across the street you can see the ballet hall
Avarege pub Service is nice location is nice as well therefore its always busy It doesent stand out in any way though
Great bar at a nice place next to the river Ljubljanica Staff is superkind service is great and fast We had coffees and beer Prices are affordable Food is maybe a little bit expensive Recommended for everyone great selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks at reasonable price
Great place for sipping beer or coffe didnt eat food this time Helpful and friendly staff
Very pleasant and an interesting assortment of hot drinks i tried the peenut butter hot chocolate and it was great Service was very good
Perfect place to enjoy a beer toastie and hot chocolate in the rain
Ok
Workers coffee place
A pleasant and quiet place where you will be served very kindly and get excellent coffee
A place for morning coffee especially friendly staff
Nice atmosphere rock music and cheap beers 
Best for impulsive late night visits It has fast food right next to it and will attract a good crowd of people quickly because of these factors It has been nicely renewed and attracts foreign Erasmus students as well as tourists but mostly locals
One of the places to go if nothing else is happening Its always open and has some people partying The prices are also very reasonable The downside of being the place to go as a meaning of last resort you will see interesting people and encounter the smell of sweatnot always but dont be surprised if you do 
Can get crowded fast Otherwise its quite good to start or end your evening pub crawl tour here Nothing too fancy tho Theres also a fast food right outside if you get hungry
Great beer options Lots of sitting areas both inside and out Good location and atmosphere
Nice  bar local atmosphere
Excellent place to have a drink in MRibir not one of those fancy places in center of the city but perfect place where you will have cosy time with your friends Parking available just in front though for a charge
Its nice and quite place to hang out with your friends
Its a must visit for anyone looking for a pristine cocktail experience Quality ingredients and knowledgeable staff yield great balanced cocktails Go check them out From the true classics to the signatures cocktails their bartenders know it all They even have their own detailed cocktail book to help you navigate the rich world of classic cocktails and help you decide on what to get A great place to get coffee in the morning or enjoy a party during the weekend this place gets into its own with a true cocktail bar atmosphere during the weekdays when they host themed cocktail nights Classic cocktails for 5 on Tuesdays signature and classic Italian cocktails on Wednesdays and signature 3course themed cocktail menus on Thursdays We usually check their instagram to see when they change up their menus as we try to go to each event at least once a month The cocktail scene in Maribor is not up to speed with the rest of the world but Niagara is a step ahead and hopefully people appreciate the effort they put in their craft
I came here for EYOF and they were advertising 80s for Saturday 297 music but when we came there they were only playing Balkan music and it was a major turn off after the excitement of 80s party
Great if you want to relax We spent 1 day in Maribor on our trip and found the place by chance but we will definitely visit again The staff was very nice and quick the drinks were delicious
the institution is good we just need more interesting music not only Slovenian but also Latin
Great garden with a view of the local montain Kids friendly offering a babychino that comes with marshmallows
What a gem A very welcome bar with great friendly staff We were out for a walk and stopped by for a drink  got chatting with the barman about the history of the house  the building has original wooden ceiling from 1847 Their outside seating is great for sunny weather
A cosy bar just outside the centre of Maribor Perfect stop before or after a walk either through Maribor or the beautiful sights above it Very friendly people and a cosy terrace
Nice place to grab a drink Right on the edge of town offers views of countryside and Pohorje 3 cute outside decks with covering and swings to sit on make a nice ambience
I love this place Very good coffee and background music A proper variety of beers and beverages Also a gift shop with vinyls and clothes and such Very funky keep it up 
Best craft beer venue in Maribor mainly from the large selection in the fridge Funky music and overall good modern vibes to the place
The young waiter is very nice  helpful and talkative but the boss is rude and the rcord store is PRETTY expensive the 7 records are not well ordered so as to  dig correctly prices are crazy when the condition sometimes is fair  Beverages are also a bit expensive
Super friendly but the owner already warned me about the priceshe was right
Ftw
The city is not very lively at night but luckily there is Loski Good beer good rock music terrace for smoking and keeping cool in summer
Il had to be there for a standup performance Charming cafe in a medieval town
Its a pretty good rock bar It wasnt my music but I still give it 4 stars
Great place Out of center but must be visited
Tasty food range of quality beers I recommend to do something on music
Great place for beer and food lovers
Good pub for a drink with the best beer selection in Kranj but we did see a rat running from the kitchen so Im never eating there again If I try to forget that incident before that we used to order a pizza and it was always good 
This place is great Its a great experience The ambiance is very welcoming and charming Amazing cocktails coffee and service Staff are extremely knowledgeable and make great recommendations large terrace on the sunny side with a grassy garden where children can play I recommend to everyone I would like to come back here again and again
Epic ice cream and really kind waitress Some innovative flavours beetroot and under 5 for 2 scoops for 2 people Great views and waitress was super accommodating
Friendly staff super location the espresso too cold and ice cream red orange artificial taste failed to met the expectations implied by the high average rating
Nice and cozy place with beautiful view of the castle and nearby hills
Good service and good personel
House is a good place
Homely friendly clean and tidy toilet and a great parking lot We will come again
A good village pub to relax with a cold drink and moderate prices
Great pizza  Best dough Great vine and beer offer Nice staff Best location Fully recommend  Ps kids will love their hot dog as well
Kralj Matja is the best pizzeria in Dolenjska Dough that doesnt stuck in your stomach quality vegetables and additives I didnt try the meat because I dont eat it Since my last visit they have added some other intresting dishes to the standard pizza offer but most of all they have improved the service which I consider a big plus The whole experience of visiting them is now at an aboveaverage level 
Joyful pizzeria in downtown Novo Mesto High energy inside always crowded Customer oriented very quick service Try the Brada Burgers  100 beef  Dont end up eating Your fingers Nice collection of wines  As the name implies its the king of places in Novo Mesto 
Ordered a matured steak after asking about the weight of the steak the waitress I dont know her name she was wearing glasses told me that it was possible to order only a 1 kg piece which was actually portioned for two hungry people  the waitress claimed it was for one but later it turned out that they had a smaller piece as well because it was ordered by someone by the next table they did not offer us a choice When ordering there was no question about how the steak was to be cooked  I assumed it would be medium but it turns out that it was cooked rare and the most disappointing was that at least half of the meat I got was so chewy that it was impossible to eat One of the worst steaks I have ever eaten despite the price being 80 euro the service and preparation was substandard my fault for not refusing the dish I left more than half of the steakchewy meat that could not be eaten I took it with me as proof of what I have written  as can also be seen in the attached picture Very dissapointed by the uninterested service and food
It is a very friendly place with a cosy atmosphere good wine and beer
A very warm and cozy place Hot cocoa was delicius They also have some vegan options I chose rice milk Cocoa with plant milk is also 10 cents cheaper than cocoa with regular milk 
Even the toilets here are trendy and super cool More importantly eight beers on tap and friendly staff passionate about beers THE place to drink in Ptuj
Cool bar with lots of different beers to offer  a lot of interesting beers  cozy bar especially inside  the interior is really cool  friendly staff  prices of beer and other drinks are ok  good place to hide from hot summer sun
Amazing all around fantasy and scifi bar Plus board games and great beer and boozy drinks
The Perfect Bar for Nerds and Gamers If you are visiting Bratislava you need to check out Dungeons Pub
If youre a nerd youll love this place Nice staff Good drinks Great board games You can borrow a BRICK power bank and charge your mobile phone at your the table Great place
What a crazy little pub This sort of thing is my jam perfect if you love Witcher Harry Potter LOTR and other fantasy brilliance Very obviously a hotspot for DD fans as well  casual Harry Potter quiz going on at the same time Im bringing my sister back here when we come to Bratislava again  awesome and the staff were so nice 
Smoking inside only cash weak beer poor choice of alcohol free drinks annoyed waitresses No clue why this place has such a good rating
Card payment not possible
Nice place really particular If you are thinking of taking a drink its the right place but they dont cook What a waste of opportunity
Great pub good selection of tasty craft beer rock music friendly staff Jack Daniels everywhere 
Excellent beer
Classic pub in Koice
Excellent beer Bachelor
Pleasant service good 
No cards accepted cash only
Classic place for beer The summer season only
right place for a pint of good beer in the open air
Place to go for a beer or other alcohol beverages if you dont mind sitting outside without service Good kebab place around the corner

Lovely little pub to enjoy your beer on your strolls in the city Great beer
A perfect place for a short rest after hard shopping at the market
Classic pub good Bernard A bit smelly toilet
everything is super pleasant obsession dora borivicka
Lovely little bar accessable from the main street through some arches into a courtyard  Outside seating area provides a nice respite from the sun  Good selection of Slovakian craft beers  Great staff with good English
Pure local and traditional No WiFi No TV No card payment You feel the oldies style Real human interaction and cordial friendly environment A preferred place to hangout
Very inviting courtyard bar with probably the most coolest customers and servers in town Try the summer masakre  one of the best sour ales ive tried
Unbelievable experience This is how all the bars should look like Its all about people No card no wifi no TV Just people socializing
Best bar in Kosice  Amazing wine selection beautifully prepared cocktails perfect atmosphere and the diamond above it all is their team Well done guys you just became my most favourite bar in Kosice 
One of the nicest friendliest cocktail bars weve ever been to We even got a free glass of prosecco Fantastic service and atmosphere
Alex is 10 out of 10 Great bartender
Very cozy place We ordered it for a small celebration at the last minute We were accepted and had reasonable prices The staff was very willing and helpful  with any help and advice
Great local slovakian pub with the hockey background
Super

Informal seating reservation possible Pleasant staff Possibility of ordering food LP
Menu smells after puke but other than that great fun Just bear in mind after 2 AM everyone is smashed 
The best are the Wednesdays with DJ Jogi
Good choice of songs and good prices they accept cards But I ordered a drink and I got a different one Yes I claimed it but without any success So 25 stars only bcs of cards accepted
There is a great atmosphere but also a lot of people so you have to wait for everything so long Very good place for team building and get to know each other You can sing whatever you want and nobody cares I love it 
Decent local pub
Super
Probably someone is misleading In any case the facility and services are suitable primarily for a clientele of the type of joint meetings of different age and gender categories It depends on the circumstances 
Pleasant bar with outdoor seating Lava beer on tap in seconds

Pleasant service nice environment in a wonderful city in the center of Koice
Im happy to go out for a meal except for some miscreants
Ok
For the introduction This is not a cafe or a pub but it is an original classic pub Previously 34 prices Im smoking The nearby drinking community and workers from the nearby hostel go here So ladies and gentlemen no big expectations This is not a place where you go on a Saturday night with a bunch of people or call a friend for coffee and a night out But a place where people run to after work for a beer and some soft drinks or when they go to buy groceries in the neighborhood they fill up here On the other hand the service is pleasant the toilet is clean the prices are lower than in the surrounding area and most importantly you can bring home an excellent dumpling 
Traditional pub with friendly service Smoking is available throughout the space and tank corgon is on tap Whoever is nearby can definitely stop by for a good tank top Beer always fresh and good Seating is also outside all year round The bonus is that you can buy homemade dumplings which are said to be the best in the city  tradition is not missing the top 
A pub where the beer is constantly tapped so you always get fresh the service is nice the prices are adequate for the company ideal for a quick beer while waiting for the woman while she is shopping in Klas  For me a plus is that they also think about the dogs who have a bowl of water and a bowl for pooping 
Under new ownership but doing great Very friendly service good with non Slovak speaking individuals and truly a good Irish feel Live music on Wednesday night brought in a great group of people and everyone definitely myself and the couple that I met seemed to have a great time Highly recommend
Ive had several people tell me Id love it so I finally decided to check it out Those people dont know me at all It seems to be a place for loud people who like sports Thats about as opposite from me as one can get Im a nerdy type who wants to talk history and geopolitics or better yet be left alone to read a book I like the arts and the opera If I walk into a pub and people are wearing sports jerseys I immediately know Im in the wrong place I think the bartender even knew I was in the wrong place because as I was standing at the bar she asked are you okay And I said yes But I toughed it out and ordered a drink The service was friendly and the ambiance was nice The location is central The price wasnt bad If people talking about sports VERY LOUDLY and playing sporting events via their phones VERY LOUDLY all around you is your thing then youll love this place As for me I will not be returning and I will tell the people who keep pestering me to go there that I have tried it Ive lived outside America for ten years now While I appreciate people I meet trying to be kind and sending me to the one bar they know where everyone speaks English I dont need that
Wonderful pub where you can also turn up on your own If youre looking for conversation youll end up knowing most of the other guests at the bar There are pub quizzes and theme nights everything is very informal If I lived here this would definitely be my favourite pub
Fantastic intimate environment we enjoyed watching both rugby semifinals last weekend during our visit to Bratislava Shane and team were incredibly helpful hosts Note  you cant book Just visit and enjoy
Difficult to find as its just a single door that leads to the cellar but a great pub with music just at the right volume that you can enjoy it but also still hold a conversation friendly staff good priced drinks
Really nice undergrounded place The only two problems there are 1 The smokers Its un undergrounded place and if people smoke you can barely breath 2 It seems like the barman is more nice to the locals and less welcomed the foreigns guests Besides that everything was perfect and cool nice drinks cools vibes and people
Nice little bar which in underground and really difficult to find the bar had a good vibe and the waitress bar person was very friendly again another place which is cash only For me personally Its only downfall for me was because its underground there is very little ventilation and the bar allows folks to smoke I mean its 2022 we definitely would have stayed longer but unfortunately because of this we left after one drink Nice bar though
Amazing quaint bar A bit difficult to find but worth the search Its a really big cellar with an amazing atmosphere cheap drinks and wonderful staff Good thing to note most of the bar is a smokers area which I appreciated
Derby Pub has an absolutely amazing team great food and great service We came unplanned on the evening of the ice hockey game of the Slovak team against Switzerland The store was full and we 9 people The pub manager then found a solution for us and we had a great evening Even the forgotten sweater was sent to Germany afterwards Incredible service Thanks Absolute recommendation and we would love to come back anytime Cheers Oli
Nice place Decent level of service Overall enjoyable experience Would recommend
Very nice place
Cheap daily menu of often poor quality You can sit inside or during summer season outside on terase After reconstruction the interior looks nice with many sport souvenirs jerseys posters
Definitely the best whiskywhiskey bar in Bratislava even the rest of Slovakia But do not worry even if you are not a whisky fan you can still have a pint of beer glass of wine or shot of whatever and enjoy the cosy atmosphere of the place Very wide range of whiskies available to taste and learn about The owner is a whisky expert with a great knowledge and experience so you may end up talking for hours while enjoying those great drams For whisky lovers they even provide tastings with various topics where you may find out even more Total must gomust see type of place and it is definitely worth the travel even though it is not in the centre of the city Believe me youre gonna love it and return 
Amazing place to have a whisky in a cozy bar Owner is a true expert and can recommend you a dram based on your taste
Honestly this has got to be the best whiskey bar in central Europe It blows my mind its in Petralka
Simply the best bar in Bratislava From the moment You walk in Youll find yourself in Whiskey world Nicely lighted long showcase full of bottles from the whole world are waiting for your taste buds Owner has huge knowledge about whiskey all around the world able to present in english as well open to discuss If You are Whiskey guy or just open minded to explore new guilty pleasures come exactly here You will not regret
Great place for good beer   food at a reasonable price They have daily menus but the alacarte options are also not priced as steeply as elsewhere Everything was fresh and tasty   They have several types of beer on tap my favorite would be the 11 Staropramen the color is rich and so is the taste  19 for 05L  There is a smokers  nonsmokers section available
Great food and great beer even well poured Guinness my goodness Pure Genius 
Super tasty pizza snails 
I would have given 5 stars but you can only pay with cash Not being able to pay by card is a major downside in my opinion
I had a fun enough time here but only because I was drunk The mens toilets were a nightmare Some staff were openly antilgbt for no reason and the Iranian guy was super aggressive which is kind of funny He obviously takes himself seriously but dresses like a clich dork and its hard not to laugh at how ridiculous he is He made people extremely uncomfortable and honestly needs to calm down Total jerk
TERRIBLE SERVICE The staff was super rude They kick us out of the place with no manners yelling us that they wanted to go home We were a big group and we consumed a lot so as clients we deserve respect specially because we werent misbehaving The owner was as rude as his waiters I explained to him the situation and he insulted me Clients are treated like trash so I DEFINITELY DONT RECOMMEND IT If you dont know how to treat people then dont put a customer service business
We had a lot of fun playing karaoke Drinks were good and service was friendly A fun place 
The sound system for the karaoke is not good at all just one lonely speaker in the corner The singer cannot hear a thing heshe is singing
Its a nice bar with a good beer garden I like that they serve Stupavar beers The staff were friendly and spoke good English
Fancy presented bottles at a bar on many levels but this is meanless No cocktails cannot make simplest Old Fashioned failed to make Aperol Spritz starting from Step 1 from the recipe httpsusinshakercomcocktails1098aperolspritz  Fun fact exactly Old Fashioned photo is placed in mens toilets with ads of golden rum
Good food enough TVs around if you come to watch sports and the lounge bar downstairs for whiskey  cigar lovers is a relaxing place to go to
Lots of TVs and ugly hockey and Guinness memorabilia the interior would have been quite elegant without it Surprisingly nice bathrooms Very slow service even though the place was more or less empty Weirdly expensive
Good place to try craft beers and typical Slovak food Cozy place with a large and very pleasant terrace  Unfortunately I was travelling as a guide with my group and we had a closed menu but next time I would like to try the Haluky Good presentation and complete dishes very good strdel Super friendly blond waiter on order Efficiency and speed Kofola a competitor of cocacola for years can be tasted there
An impressive beer house with options you dont find in the rest of the city There was an organised city tour present when I visited but theres no reason not to pop in on your own with a good mix of tables throughout inside as well as some seating in the courtyard It was annoying that they have a minimum 10 spend on card payments so I had to stay a bit longer than I originally intended but if youre a beer lover then you wont mind
A beer lovers dream Get the flight of beer to sample the most here the grapefruit beer was unreal We also shared the platter for 2 between 3 which was plenty The sausage and bryndzov haluky was especially good Loved the courtyard nice atmosphere
Great place and value of money The food was so delicious and the daily menu includes beef soup with vegetables  pork schnitzel with potato salad The menu costs 890 EUR The service was excellent and the staff speaks good English 
Big rock themed bar in the prime location Nice decoration and great music not to expensive
Excellent late night bar with great people watching seating The staff was top notch as well
the decoration itself pays the whole visit Beer at a reasonable price nice staff and amazing decor  i cant express this enough Also the playlist definitely one of my favorite places to visit in bratislava
There is planty of space inside and few tables outside Very cool atmosphere and nice beer
A local neighborhood pub open only from 5 to 10 pm Dont get turned off by the front bar which looks and feels a bit dingy and unfortunately allows smoking indoors  walk past into the beautiful courtyard and you can chill with fanatstic Pilsner Urquell tapped into chilled glasses You may even end up striking a conversation with a few local regulars whilst at it
The best pilsner in Bratislava besides that it is a small and cosy almost private place with perfect garden during the summer
Super cozy atmosphere attentive staff very polite guests and the best Pilsner in town  hands down
Very nice backyard Worth visit
I really like the place small and cozy the waitress was very polite
Great atmosphere good beer and friendly service I recommend
Nice place good local beers and very friendly staff  
Former public bathrooms are now the coziest and more beautiful bar in town What a surprise A little bit far away from main center definitely worths a visit
I ate here twice and had a great meal both times  The local cuisine I tried included pork schnitzel and chicken with noodles Both meals were excellent and I really enjoyed them  The cost including beer was very reasonable  I would recommend coming back here again
The local food was absolutely delicious Highly recommend to try the local food instead of normal offerings The lager beer was not my taste but the IPA was great In my opinion one of the best choices to have lunch there are good daily offers or dinner in the city center of Bratislava The staff is really friendly and well organized If I come back to Bratislava sometime Im surely gonna be eating here again
This specific location is further outside of the city center than their other spot but it was worth the short trek Authentic Slovak food which is quite rich and flavorful and some delicious beer The leziak 10 and 12 and the Bubak 12 were all very good easy drinking and paired well with the food English menu was helpful and the waitress was very friendly and gave some good suggestions Interior is rustic yet modern Great place to stop for lunch or dinner and some local beers Also a great beer garden out back for warmer weather
Once again I find myself trying a new cuisine This time Slovakian Excellent dishes generous portions and quick service  I want to point out that I was charged 160 for bread I didnt order it assuming it comes free as all other restaurants The waitress didnt inform me of this too I was going to give the restaurant 5 stars but because of this incident I decided not to Nevertheless highly recommend
Best bar in Slovakia Oscar was great and friendly the owner The bartenders Jenny and her boyfriend were really nice too Jenny is a top class bartender which can make you any cocktail you desire and can even create a new one on the spot Great place to chill out on a regular evening and listen to some daddy rock I also heard that they have event evenings in the bar like karaoke or openmic Would definately return to Bratislava just to visit this bar again Also very welcome to people from any country hence the international bar
My favourite bar in Bratislava its always full of amazing bartenders and specials The spicy shot definitely changed my life Jenny is the best and the owner Oscar is so friendly
Such a friendly and amazing atmosphere here The staff are unbelievably welcoming and friendly They also have some great events throughout the week Highly recommend visiting when youre in Bratislava
a place that has managed to attract a vibrant and diverse international community even expats from Africa which is quite uncommon for Bratislava The beer selection could be broader but the place is still charming Nevertheless it is most suitable for young expats and international students



Quite nice service and place Bad is smoking area is not separated well
Good place for spend time with friends

Super 
Nice beer and even better service
The beer and the service were great  just the cigarettes brrr but whats up Id like to stop
The beer ran out but the pizza didnt even come to mind because the pizza bars were unbaked There is only one Prosecco on offer for almost twenty euros its strange But they probably know what to drink with what they offer The staff tried but todays trouble was not about them 
Good original place and very good beer
Nedocapovane
Supeeer 
You get a lock for your bike and while you drink super dewy you can see your bike on TV
Amazing decorations

Very tasty kitchen Excellent place
Fantastic food as usual attentive staff place is opened for vaccinated people only
Perfect beer Superb food Willing staff  Recomending to try cutted beer
Perfect place to meet your friends tonight with tankbeer from the biggest and most famous brewery of the region or the state   Friendly atmosphere young waitors and tasty food
I was pleasantly surprised by the new nice look of the company  I would like to thank the owner for Radegast 12 Unfortunately the staff although friendly cannot deal with screaming customers
Nice service pleasant renovated environment I felt very comfortable as in a family environment
The beer is as good as any in Slovakia Service ok I recommend it Adam from Poland

Preov underground You will meet someone there The waiter is ok 
Empty bar the newspaper is still bothering us to buy something because we have nothing else to do there besides we ordered and he kept coming to us to order something he must have been drunk because there was quite a smell of alcohol he even told us that he could see that we have money so why dont we order
Super super the best guy in Preov sexy Kevin Everyone leaves satisfied and Ill be back tomorrow 
its a disgustingly smoky cheap hole with average soulless beer with a weird environment and patrons I strongly do not recommend it
Since when has Majko been working there the beer has a completely different taste I highly recommend it Eln brought it there
They have good beer here  ARI
They also serve a gift of bacon with bread
Even during the summer season you can sit on the terrace but only for a while and in winter its not only cold outside but inside I recommend warm socks 
I will never go in again in my life we arrive the waitress is disgusted we sit at the table we wait 10 minutes the service did not even intend to come to serve us Meanwhile she was playing on the phone So after 10 minutes of sitting in the dry we left In the end he doesnt even say hello Thank you very much 
The only thing wrong are probably the photos of Slovak cyclists on the wall 


We had reservation on Thursdays after wedding I have to say that food was very nice and tastyit was good that we was placed upstairs that we had privacy
On internet it says its opened but its closed in reality so I would say you can go to restaurant that its opened instead to actually get some food  Gea
Excellent fantastic a 10 in all deal menu prices and facilities Of the best Ive tried on Presov 
Nice pub nearby the city center Good Slovak quisine Amazing pub during the summer time because of local musical bands playing the local Slovak music Strongly recommend when youre in Presov
The business was not open during opening hours We waited half an hour
Good place with public transport connections and a separate parking lot currently poor service
A business within walking distance of the main station in Preov
A pleasant cafe with excellent Krombacher beer on tap
Nice place to have a beer play some darts table soccer or pool so plenty of choises and in summer you can have barbecue outside and sit next to river
redhesd waitress and her colleague are the best waitresses ever
redhead waitress top with her colleague too
I like this place
Good sitting with a beer
Pretty good


Great cozy place with a nice friendly atmosphere Just when you come in to this place make sure youll bring your own  ice for the drinks as I was told by the waiter they dont have any at the bar  also there should be more food available not just chips
The beer is fine an they have some food too For me was a big minus that in every corner you were able to look at the big TV screen There was smoking and non smoking room too
Very good and reputable pub amongst young people The long wait time especially for nonfiltrated beer kinda ruins the overalll experience
nice pub with nice people recommended to visit One reservation though no bread available on friday afternoon until 7pm and therefore no way to eat anything but chips
Very disappointed Margarita was watered down and nowhere near authentic For a place like this bit was a very poor effort Putting profits over quality
Nice experience welcoming staff and great drinks with a spectacular view of the city square
Awesome drinks with comfortable and in many ways special atmosphere
Nice view and drinks
If you are from Nitra and you love rock music you know this is the best place for you to rock whole night

Great rock club with perfect sound
Super
Dont drink bloody Mary It is just terrible Other cocktails are quite nice
Perfect bar for drinks which were delicious  Staff was perfect
Definitely good place for start evening drinks staff musicsometimes loud for chat  smoke and nonsmoke area nice ladies friendly peoplestopping by is a must for evening in Nitra
I like it so much The best coctail bar in Nitra They have special cocktails the stuff is very friendly
We discovered this place by chance while descending from the via ferrata and we have to say that we couldnt have hit it better They just had the socalled October fest We were attracted by the smell of grilled sausages and the nice man behind the grill Come and taste it he called us  Unreal goodness Quality sausages from Slovak farmers We had to take a double too  Excellent beer and cheerful babies behind the bar Really nice atmosphere Conclusion If there are still such companies in Slovakia and among us such great people who enjoy their work it is not completely lost here You made our day very pleasant Thank you 
I dont know if it was because I climbed halfway to Zobor But I think I can recognize a good beer Really special 
Absolute unit among pubs in Nitra Great beer atmosphere and must be experienced 
Home atmosphere with the best draft beer in Nitra Whether you are going on a hike or just for a walk on Zobor refreshing yourself with Svijani among pleasant people and always cheerful service is the right choice every time




Ive been there a few times every time there was a drunken man behind the bar and it didnt matter if a person came there at 6 in the morning or in the evening always drunk its just a disaster 
It is located right next to the new bus station
Bad environment The operator is obviously under the influence of alcohol man

Best place
I didnt eat anything but we drank a lot in a great atmosphere
A cozy place where you meet the same drunk people at 7am and 7pm All warm great service great prices By far the best pub Ive been to outside of Germany
The pub is already 100 years old and still has the same owner values and advantages specifically the arrowrenovated improved and there are no differences 
Beautiful ancient space Good beer and great offer of drinks Nice service Best burgers in town right at the corner
Its most lovely Bar in Banska Bystrica Best barmen and good quality alcohol with nice service
Great coffee for good price The view is amazing and the esthetic is gorgeous Would recommend this to anyone
Best coffee in BB Service A1 and really nice servers A
Pleasant establishment wider selection of capped beers even though Prazacka was not there during my visit Caring staff interested in clients comfortable sitting in the atrium part
Very nice place Very tasty beer I only saw the bachelor here Thank you Mr Martin
Inconspicuous from the outside pleasant space from the inside The owner took care of the business to have its own atmosphere They have great Bakalr beer on tap and have a large selection of drinks The fact that there is a pleasant atmosphere in the company is made possible by the nice staff The owner is very helpful and plays music on request 
Excellent nice environment nice staff they have a wide selection of beers and wines Very pleasant sitting I recommend a good one for me
Nice place with great selection of tasty local beers on tap
cozy pub with great beer selection friendly service
Very nice pub with big variation of beers you can play billiard chess and other games Indoor is nonsmoking but there is a terrace where you can smoke Personal is nice and quick prices are normal You can buy a beer from 130 to 2 Have a fun
Very nice place with nice landscapes churches or other historical buildings Almost evey second week there are some atractions sponzored by the townhall In sum very nice calm place with proper bars restaurants with siting directly on the square

Super
I recommend all for 1 
I recommend it to everyone who has a request and a taste for good beer Every Friday evening there is country music until 0100 in the morning Im drinking beer Urpiner 10 Staroprame Brno 12 Corgo 10 at a price of 130
Very bohemian and decadent
Urpin 12 a Gambrinus 10
Dirty smelly pub village style
Varman didnt fire us even though it was already after the final Respectively he also tapped others Big 
Great and friendly staff especially owner good beer and drinks
A great business on the square in Bansk Bystrica that has original spaces whether its a night bar or a terrace with an offer of fresh drinks high standard and great service Cheers 
Excellent atmosphere with excellent and professional service Its been a long time since Ive enjoyed mixology in Bansk Bystrica For a mixed drink definitely come here well thank you
Nice beer pleasant service great seating
Great company nice staff I recommend 
Pleasant service everything top
A beautiful business with nice service  I recommend visiting
A great business that was missing in the center of Bansk Bystrica
Fantastic place to have a night out in Bistrica I walled in around 11 pm and people were already dancing on the tables Drinks are affordable and the atmosphere is just fantastic The only thing I would possibly improve is the amount of staff behind the bar as you could wait to get served a while Other than that the perfect place to get smashed and dance
It is a good place to enjoy but not everytimeSometimes there can be fights and racist people 
They kicked us 15 hours before closing time even if the pub was still almost full
Cheap bar with rock or oldies music
Great Prazdroj For me the best beer in town right after the Academy
Nice environment for social events excellent environment
Great as always  Definitely a must visit at any price
Something Ive been looking for in Trnava for a long time
5th anniversary of the founding of the club good action nice guys

The perfect clubhouse for bikers and friends of this club
Clubhouse where you wont leave thirsty Alcoholic and nonalcoholic snack The advantage is a large parking lot I recommend and will come again

Cozy with great selection of beer as well as nonalcoholic beers and small things to nash
Nice bar just waited little bit longer to be served

The best beer in Vrutki 

Rock
If this place ever gets resurrected let me know I have sneakers locked in there
Everything is okay but there has been a problem with the toilets for years unfortunately people are to blame
The only ones open after 2300
Very nice place to spend the time with friends
Try the hermelin 
Beer very good Pilsner nice on tap tasty exactly as it should be The waitress took good care of us The price matched the quality Satisfaction
A smaller nonsmoking establishment with a terrace A good selection of alcoholic beverages and there is also draft beer and nonalcoholic draft beer I also caught an offer for something light to eat so its worth a look
Place is nice and quiet and its a much better option than sitting in overcrowded mall next to it They offer snacks beers coffees and they even had nargilas You can play darts and they have a lovely collection of vintage lamps in their windows I would describe the place as warm and cozy
I go there all the time They have great live music on Friday and Saturday Not folk but it is Serbian The waiters are terrible and always try and scam you Pay after every drink do not wait until the end of the night to pay They do not give you actual receipts but somthisom they make in a computer Their prices are not the same all the time Yesterday I paid one price for a beer at 7 and 20 minutes later I paid a different price The lines for the bathroom is always long and they only have 2 unisex bathrooms so even the guys have to wait a long time if you dont mind all of this and crappy service GMP is a great place to go to
Nice and cozy place but stuff is not patient and rude to the customer Also bot everything from the menu is not available we came for snack and there was no food available Belvil location
great place with good beer choice situated in the business district of New Belgrade perfect for a coffee or a beer break from work
Fine pub nice and quite at the time we visited fine service and polite staff clean and a few beers on tap great place to have a quick pit stop for our party as its a reasonable walking distance from a few points of interest Will note that I forgot inside smoking is still a thing in parts of the world but this was not a problem here could still smell but wasnt overwhelming
This place gives off a local pub atmosphere and I loved it It spans two floors and feels like a chilled place away from the madness of the city to enjoy a few drinks  Staff and service are great and the drinks are very reasonably priced Heavy pours and welcoming locals is what we experienced and why we will be coming back
Cosy local pub You can visit if you stay around here otherwise no need to come
Great little pub with friendly staff Definitely a place with regulars Easy to lose a few hours here
Actually we got just for coffee but I really enjoyed looking at the photographs on the walls
Nice and quiet just so you can enjoy your coffee
Such a cute place with a fun and cool design A real neighborhood gem And they serve Turkish coffee
best recommendation for BPR it is do jaja
I must have walked past this place 30 times and just not fancied it It looks a bit too dark a bit too smoky not for me I finally popped in on the hunt for some footy and was pleasantly surprised Decent prices pretty decently sized inside various table options small tables large communal raised counter tables  definitely worth a shot if you are walking by
Absolute brilliant pub Staff very friendly and atmosphere was brilliant Beer nice and cheap and even sell in litre glasses Would highly recommend a visit to anyone that is near
The best pub in town Has such authentic vibe I love the lights and atmosphere Music is cool and rockish You can meet interesting people A lot of foreigners
Great place to go out with your friends and have a couple of beers They serve peanuts with the beer which is awesome Theres a cool basement like room with a pool table as well
Good beer very decent food Ive tried Corner sausages and its really good Definitely can recommend this place
Its close to bus station and it was one of the open places early in the morning Staff was kind and food was good price was normal Kitchen serves untill 2100 pm
Its really 5 Tasty and lowsalty food A lot of type or beer Friendly English speaker personal Good air condition and range hood
Its a restaurant design rather than a pub Good sraff and usual local draft beer
I believe this place is great at night when you wanna chill with a beer  As a restaurant Im not too sure  Jolly Roger is ideal if you enjoy smoking cigarettes indoors where its dark during the day and appreciate ancient cliche rock music We asked the waitress for a burger with lots of meat and this is what we got It I was tasty and the price was good and the people who worked there were kind and helpful
The food is fine but the chicken could have been more fried Cosy place and the waiters are able to speak English 
Nice atmosphere but service is not very good They asked me to pay when I just started eating and after that no one came to offer me another drink or something else so I felt quite unwelcome here Also there were some pieces of bones in the sausage or smth like that very hard The cocktail tasted like water
Brilliant Burger cant fault it Fantastic menu variety and great value Loved the chilled vibe super relaxed and friendly
Its a solid pub with a good selection of beers and rock music playing in the background It gets busy Chicken wings were mediocre
Very cozy reasonably priced and even when its full the staff is fast and professional They have a good selection of beer liquor and mixed drinks Didnt try the food but nachos were great
Very laid back atmosphere great selection of beersdicent pricesrock and roll music  overall this pub is a hidden gem of Belgrade
Its perfect ambient for rock and metal heads and people who appreciates real music good vibe and of course excellent beer The staff is great younglings with smile and great sence for humor ready to serve you the way you should we always leave a good tip for them If you come here you will want to go back over and over again
Last week I was in Belgrade on business meeting During the day i met girl which promote Pub crawl and I took a flyer form her After few hours i decide to go with them in hangover This is absolutely amazing and I must repeat it next time
Best experiance
Wellkept Salon 1905 restaurant in an enchanting location Excellent international wine list and varied and extensive menu Highly recommended


A perfect bar Tons of cocktails a great variety of beers reasonable prices
Really nice and cozy irish style of a pub You feel like in a giant living roomwith people chattering and sounds of games on TVs They also have live music sometimesand great selection of beer
Decent Bar vibes within the centre though up an alley which aided the better environment Sports are shown though without sound and the ambience overall is A with celtic music blaring nonstop Its not too formal or too divelike  so well balanced for all crowds
absolutely great places with amazing staff creating great atmosphere  lots of live music at night great secluded place for chilling in the morning or early afternoon  it is The Place to get Guinness in Novi Sad
Cocktails are good but music is too loud We cant even hear each other
A popart spot in a quiet street of the city of Novi Sad
Nice place with very hospitable stuff Good for chilling
Nice
Really nice pub Ambient is good big cool decorated Nice selection of beer and alcohol in general and also coffee is good The guys are friendly fast service helpful and nice Our waiter has his first day and that was not a problem he was really quick and kind Food is tasty should try burgers they are good and not expensive Recommend this place
Decent spot to enjoy a couple beers before or after a visit to Petrovaradin Fortress
Nice and cozy place nice music but there is no any food and poor choice of beer
Nice place small and not to loud
Very nice to relax and kaffa or drink The service very good I enjoy this place a lot
Great place to visit if you want to get stonecold beer chat with your friends or watch a game or two on the TV Waitresses there are really polite and the quality of service is on a really high level Would highly recommend Bratis to anyone passing by
Fine place where you can feel like at home Excellent music good drink prizes great atmosphere
Nice local pub with good service Quite busy place during weekend
By far the best experience that I had in Novi Sad The atmosphere is great the personal is very friendly and the deserts and drinks are just wow
Pleasant atmosphere great location nice staff and decent food A little bit pricey Overall a good place for dining out if you want to try interesting combinations of flavors and meat
One of my favorite places to come grab a coffee or something to eat 1010 would recommend
An all right place Wouldve been an easy recommend if the service was a tad faster
Very stylish bar with great vibes and really friendly staff The music is cool and so are the people They dont serve food but as i saw you are allowed to order from elsewhere and consume it here Definitely  one of the best spots in Novi Sas I would only suggest a little bigger variety of beers Otherwise it is a perfect place
The most amazing place Ive been in Serbia The atmosphere is so welcoming and the service is immaculate The wide range of craft beers ensures that everyone will find something for their taste Special praise for everyone working at the bar
Not a very large assortment of beer but quite atmospheric place  it is calm and cozy here as if you came to the living room to your friends
Great place Relaxed great choice of beer nice music super service
Inadmissible for one place The hostess at the entrance did not let two of my friends in because they were dressed in sports can you imagine Then when I asked what the problem was he continued to comment on the physical appearanceVery bad purely sovinxtic If you are a tourist in the city never let this place be your choice
Extremely rude houstes Their only jib is to seat people and be nice and even with that they are soooo rude
Excellent restaurant for lunch and dinner great ambience and amazing service 
great place to go out in the city
Nice location but the waiter was not really interested in any service at all
A great selection of bears and spirits They also make a very good Irish coffee and they dont spare on whiskey During the spring summer and early autumn there are many tables outside in the garden and most of them are sheltered from the sun
Nice place with good draft beer recommended
Nice pub with a big garden and good selection of drinks Its located in a passage together with a burger restaurant and some other bars
If you want to taste fresh Serbian draft beer and at the same time feel the atmosphere of a traditional pubs ambiance you should visit this place During the weekend I experienced pleasant light poprock music with two acoustic guitars
Great rock gigs cold beer and good atmosphere in this pub I highly recommend it
one of several rnr clubs in novi sad friendly staff excellent atmosphere and cold beer
Great atmosphere with everyone singing along to the evenings act two guys with guitars evidently giving expert renditions of popular Serbian songs The beer was decent though not a huge choice on tap It gets packed but local punters are happy to share tables with strangers just passing by Great service with the waitress joining in with a shot or two And of course smoking is thankfully allowed A great place to chill and get away from the loud nightclubs neighbouring the pub
Nice selection of craft beers but it used to be better There were more people there Nice place to visit with interesting decoration
Nice pub good beer you can sit inside and outside  No food menu only a small selection of snacks
Great craft beer variety I recommend Akira beer and Honey I Am Drunk These are my favourites Its a small local pub in the heart of Novi Sad If sitting outside you can also order food from a restaurant next door
Cool pub with great selection of craft beers
Very nice place especially for the ones who like rock music and alternative places A bar with a soul and cool atmosphere prices are very reasonable and staff is polite Recommend
Wide selection of drinks great music Best pub in city center
Pretty nice here The lemonade is very good Nice view
Not bad for drinks but the owner of the bar may suddenly ask you to empty the chair you have been sitting in for 40 minutes just because it is required for his friends who came No advance warning no desire to solve the problem very aggressive behavior  For the first time in Serbia I see such aggression
A shame for a city that is called the capital of culture An illegal building in an undefended part of the Danube bill what is bill



Great place casual often has live music
Great Live music is played here very often good live music may I add The staff is organized and nice to the customers And mostly yound people students come here so if youre looking for a happy youthful atmosphere youve come to the right place Music and cheerful surroundings  everything you need in life
We went there to have a cup of coffee during the day outside and it was good We also went there during their live performance at night The staff was different and completely clueless when it comes to cocktails they were advertising Disappointing and waste of money
Excellent place for a night out Its not expensive and allways full Tuesdays and Fridays have live music
Good location good coffee good music
Good location well laid out garden Helpful waiters
A nice quiet place where you can have a coffee or a drink to relax in a conversation because the ambiance of the location as well as the friendly staff make you feel comfortable
Nice and they try but the menu is full of complicated titles and foreign expressions
Great service good domestic coffee
Not so brilliant experience at the moment I was there The whole place is lying in the basement so mobile signal is very weak and Wifi wasnt working then either I felt like blind Plenty of food though at reasonable prices as usualy in town of Ni which I already can see as an attractive tourists destination in future Under circumstances that local auctorities lift up towns outlook
Great beer nice atmosphere looks really cool prices are solid unfortunately the last time I was there end of April they didnt serve food hopefully they change that soon
Perfect place to hang out with your friends and have a beer 
We have been at the city only for an hour and had coffee by the river I just wanted to say how friendly polite and helpful was the staff Thank you
Slow ordering slow delivery of food and when finally the food arrived it was not what i ordered
Cool live Music Nice beers and very beautiful place Also staff was very friendly
LOVE This Place Super casual vibe with a great variety of live entertainment every night The new menu is AmAZing The beef burger is 250gr and so tender and lean It arrives on a stone platter with a separate wooden covered container Inside awaits the most delicious smothered and perfect burger Ive ever had Even the cutlery and napkin is placed on a stone platter Excellent food and fantastic prices Best place in town and especially on the river
Corona pivo 033  800 dinara D Grcka Halkidiki hotel 5 5 eura D eksluzivno  there are no pricing trends in the region with the price this high thats what I am sure of
Very nice ambient and they have some cool offers You should try the CafRaspberry offer Cheap price and tasty drinks
Great atmosphere and hospitality Especially for those of you like us passing by with your motorcycles  dont miss a chance to exhange a few words with the owner Will be definitely back when in town see you
Fantastic spot super friendly staff and the best carrot cake ever
It is a hidden place you can reach by an elevator I have surprised how big is this place and its fancy At te evening the place got full there wasnt free table The staff was correct they spoke english and they were fast enough We have tasted a Hamburger with bluecheese and Fish and chips The burger was very good The toilette is not clean enough and so small for this big place They have a non smoking part but it has a little smoke smell
Great place for a date or just hang out with friends good choice of cocktails and they even have non alcoholic ones and thats rare for nis Fusion kitchen and food are incredibly yummy excellent vegan choices My fav goto place
I mean its not the worst place Prices are sky high Food is okay My pasta was quite disappointing it was cooked pasta cheese grated on top and a few pieces of bacon  no sauce in any form just dry but my grandma liked her masala But my grandpas burger was completely raw in the middle
Experience a stunning sunset in their garden The restaurant is located on top of a building in the center of Nis  The food is amazing well prepared My recommendation would be any of the burgers that they offer  Some tables are reserved for lunchdinner so you cant sit anywhere unless you plan to have a meal There is a nonsmoking zone smoking zone and a graden with an open roof  If you want to enjoy food with a nice view I highly recommend this place  Great restaurantcaffe in general but a bit on the pricy side for Serbia
Located on the very busy pedestrianised street this is a great location to sit outside in the sun and watch the world go by Theres a good amount of seating outside some under cover from the sun and plenty inside too The staff are all super friendly and welcoming and with the music from the bars adjacent theres a good atmosphere without anything being over bearing One of the best options in the area and Ill certainly be back
A classic rock pub a solid selection of beers as well as other beverages  great location in the city center next to the pedestrian zone  Average prices  Good service friendly staff  there is a smoking area  It has a garden on the pedestrian section
Classic pub nothing special but nothing bad either  Only complaint is the general cleanliness of the womans bathroom Standard maybe a bit higher prices for drinks Food I cannot comment on because Ive only had the peanuts with my beer 
Black beer and hot wine Amazing staff lovely music and atmosphere 
A wonderful place after a long night walk we were looking for somewhere to sit and drink and we find this place Everybody smiling toilets are clean Thank you
A unique place Here you can have a drink with a view of Skuptina It already leaves a lasting impression that you can sip rakija near the main building of the country The rakija is great and the bartenders are friendly
Great beer but slow service
Perfect coffee always fresh draft beer Great music
Get 1 litre of beer NoRagrats
Located in the center great atmosphere  various dishes taste amazing pleasnt staff music  in the night live music One down side dough not great choice of Vine
Great atmosphere extremely pleasant staff decent variety of drinks both strong and light variants Lounge music can be a bit loud but you can talk normally wuhout the need to raise your voice
Amazing atmosphere and food Great service 
Great vibe inside and out burgers are really good as well as the appetizers My wife and I live ordering the homemade chips as well  lots of beer choices obviously too Its a really good price for quality of food and vibes of the place We go regularly when we want a burger or beer
You have to try it BeerLand Pub probably the best Pub in Belgrade Amazing beer selection with always adding new beers Very welcome stuff Food is unexpectedly good for that kind of food restaurant For beer lovers and all others it is strongly recommended
They are pet friendly which is the most important thing for me
Best pub in belgrade great value for money
Excellent pub in the city center Good selection of drinks very affordable  The staff is really pleasant Very attentive very fast All in all a bunch of good people  Theres an indoor section which is alright but the highlight is the garden area Great atmosphere good amount of seating  The place is mostly frequented by locals but Ive seen one or the other tourist here  The only thing which would make this place even better would be longer hours say til 4am
Waiter is homophobic He came out of nowhere and started to insult my girlfriend and me cuz we are gay He threatened us that if we do that again kiss that he would throw us out
Dont listen to these LGBTQ warriors who are trying to be offended and make it look like they are targeted everywhere place is wonderful
Probably the worst place ive been to The staff was so rude and the drinks were not that good also Not a pleasant experience here
I love this place The staff is always very friendly and great the service is fast whether youre ordering food or just drinks There is a great variety of everything here beers other alcoholic beverages foodthere are vegetarian options as well coffee  The prices are pretty good too and the decor indoors and outdoors is awesome During the day its not busy at all and you can work on your laptopreadstudy in peace
Nice cozy atmosphere Staff is really nice and friendly Great for nonprivate parties Home beer is really good definetelly a recommendation Seems that food is nice though I have not tried any But food on other tables seemed nice Best pub in this area of Belgrade so far for me Only thing that I have missed is bar stools at bar not enough
Stumbled across this place more by accident than on purpose and was meant to be just a quick stop on a longer pub crawl but it was so good we stayed all night The atmosphere is amazing they had a really good live band in and the food looked spectacular as well Definitely will be back here again
Friendly service and nice pub food Excellent beer selection
Funny waiters tasty and strong craft beer and a homely atmosphere Theres nothing more for a student like me to want
Great place great beer Try their blueberry Bad opening hours on sundays but its ok
This is actually black turtle pub which is great place for good beer that doesnt cost a fortune
Excellent beer Even with some friot flavors
This old bar is still kicking strong Decent selection of drinks and also very good food of you need a quick snack Many similar places in Belgrade have lost their character by leaning towards more general public but IMHO this one still preserves some of its old spirit
After many visits Ive decided to share a humble opinion about this place Its the perfect place to chill with friends do a job or have a meeting as you can have an actual conversation without being interupted by staff or by loud music Indoors or outdoors both have quite decent ambiance so the Pub has to offer both based on your own preference Despite the fact that the place is not luxurious it still definitely deserves a 5  rate based on experience after many visits
Shared a night with 50 other South Africa fans watching the rugby WORLD CUP
Excellent authentically English pub Great atmosphere lovely staff and great beer garden out front
I spent a few hours here yesterday hiding from the rain All off the staff were nice and always had a smile The beer was never cold though which was disappointing I ordered food typical bar snack of nachos Went for the nachos party which I can tell you was a pretty poorly organized party to say the least It was bland boring missing the main characters guac salsa cheese and just a complete let down if Im honest
This is truly a beautiful Irish Pub with huge selection of Beers and Drinks A band playing at entrance life music Seats inside in two levels and outside Fast bar keepers A soccer kicker upstairs and a dart game makes friends Had a wonderful time in this bar Strongly recommend to visit this beautiful place in center of old Belgrade
Atmosphere of bar is great also cocktails  Bulldog margarita was our favorite I could recommend Harats lager as beer Workers were friendly Generally thanks
Pretty cool Irish pub in a busy area of Belgrade Waiters were friendly and the atmosphere was nice A good selection of beers and good music Im sure people will enjoy it The only bad thing is the smell of cigarettes inside since they allow smoking
Bad staff low service I asked if they have domestic rakija she said ofcourse and brought me some kind of poison rakija And on top of that i had to pay right after she brought drinks even though i was sitting inside  winter time  Cheap place There are many better places closeby i do not recommend coming here 
Nice quiet place for a drink Nothing fancy but nice interior and terrace
Im a simple man if its not allowed to smoke I give 5 stars
Very lovely placeEvery sunday live music and great atmosfereNot expensive
Went once had some beers with friends and some finger food Decent place to hang out at night 4 star coz a lot of stuff can be better but all in all i would recommend this place to go out for a beer with friends Music was rockpop  For some reason they have hostess in a pub  
If youre a scotch and cocktail fanatik this the place Just make sure to see whats on the shelves or ask bartender for choices Waiters dont know the scotch list so you have to find out yourself
An amazing place with big beer selection and great food but awfuly loud music The waiters are very helpful and overall service is great There are usually quite a few people here later during the day and especially during the weekend so be sure to have reservation if you are coming in larger number The prices are also quite reasonable Edit Its still an amazing place but the music inside is extremely loud that you can barely talk
Great place to have drink and food Every time I visit Serbia this is place I spent with fiends Gabriela waiter makes our stay always amazing
This bar is the best one on all of Belgrade  The barman Jovan took great care of us and the drinks are genuine with a great selection of cocktails and other spirits Of course the classic plum Rakija and ye old B52   Highly recommended for group events night outs and a special place for trivia nights  Highly recommended
Lovely small pub with bar stools with armrests and backs A good bartender Ivan who helps you with drink selection Lovely music
Live music poprock great atmosphere Owners and staff super friendly
Excellent place nice atmosphere and well designed Staff is very kind
Very nice place a bit on the rustic rocknroll side located in the heart of Belgrade Nice and imaginative decoration Service was a bit slow but we came in to relax and take a break from a hectic day anyway
Really good range of cocktails and other drinks  decently priced but not a fancy sophisticated environment more of a relaxed vibe which I prefer Visited here twice whilst in Belgrade and sampled a lot of cocktails
This place have been her for decades They have one of the best cocktails in the city and prices are fair Whoever is visiting the city and looking for a good preparty bar or just to hang out with a friendsthis is definelty a place for you Cheers 
The best the salads   A great variety of food actually From salads to pizza and ice cream so it is perfect for breakfast lunch or dinner I tried the chicken salad with avocado  it was delicious and enough for one person
The place is nice but the waiters sit and smoke and chat instead of dealing with customers You have to wait a long time to order Apart from the indifference of the waiters the place is nice
Even though its February its Wednesday and its 2200 and theres no place to sit There are two floors and both floors were occupied Luckily a table was vacant and we were able to find space A nice bar filled with locals and tourists Drinks are good service is fast prices are reasonable I recommend it to everyone thank you Red Bar
Its always pretty crowded For this reason the service can sometimes be slow and you may have to wait for 1520 minutes  Cigarette smoke is annoying time to time  BUT I loveeee their Black Russian cocktails Red Bar can be preferred as there is no open bar around until late
Easily the best bar in the Belgrade Bohemian street The staff is extremely friendly and the selection of cocktails is top notch totally recommended
I was positively impressed by the speed of preparing and serving cocktails The staff was friendly The place was not crowded though all tables were reserved and occupied  The garden is really nice  Definitely will come back  Update  Im back 
The cocktails are just okay nothing special I didnt like the strong cigarette smell inside of the bar and the staff could be more polite I There are far better cocktails in Belgrade
Nice atmosphere but the waiter was not really polite so 4 
I liked the vibes the garden and even the cat
We had a sour beer with cherry and one with kiwilime which were both really good Theres a lot of different beers to choose from I recommend trying the cherry one There is a great atmosphere and many seating options inside and outside As a bonus there was a really cute cat outside This is truly a hidden gem that we found on our last night in Belgrade
We came in the evening to grab a beer  This is petfriendly place that huge garden suitable for families as well  I tried their raspberry beer  If you like sour flavors try it   The only problem is the mosquitoes which are too many  PS Beers are self service
Good brewery with lager ale APA Ipa ne ipa double types Food overpriced a little Very good music and wibe
Good selection of home brewed beer and also beer from other breweries self service bar Good selection of food items Patio and indoor seating options Takes credit cards
It may look like your average neighborhood pub but Bazar is anything but Although not the largest of pubs it packs all the key ingredients in  a good selection of real ales friendly knowledgeable staff and a great atmosphere   I wandered in with two friends on a Friday night and was immediately greeted by the friendly staff and incredible aroma of unusual cocktails The pub was filling up quickly it was almost 900 pm but we managed to snag a table   To produce good interesting cocktails at keen prices rather than just cheap standard fare is not easy but Bazar Pub manages it   Give it a go 
I didnt try the food but the cocktails are very nice and they are very descriptive about what they put in there They also ask you what taste you would like so they can make you a recommendation
Only good to say artsy friendly place with amazing location Great variety of drinks friendly staff and amazing atmosphere
Very nice place good service nice cocktails good prices
Good options for beer ranging from more fruity brews to laggers to stronger craft brews not too expensive Also good options for food ranging in prices depending on how much you planned to eat Food is high quality and its worth the price Lovely atmosphere beautiful garden and friendly staff Its near the social center of the city but in a quiet area so its a pretty good spot to stop by while waiting in the city Owner is also really friendly and doesnt sit in an office and actually works with the staff Also a good spot if you dont speak Serbian there always seems to be someone who speaks English and sometimes German
Amazing place with a very cool staff who know their beer The place has an APA beer brewed exclusively for them which is a must have All in all if you happen to be nearby pop in and enjoy it for yourself
Best place to try beers from all around serbia and the world Has outdoor seatung and indoor too Can get busy but seats atvtge bar are an option too Fab athmosphere and music too  Good for kids too early evenings and afternoons
Beer is excellent you must try Mexican Mix its a must have with beer
Good restaurant Traditional cuisine with  vegan choices good and polite staff all best
Ok

Nostalgia for old times I leave room for new generations
Nice local 
Good food for little money

The restaurant is nice and well equipped with benches and seats for eating The guys who welcome us are all extremely kind and helpful We had dinner on two evenings with our 3 dogs and we were able to choose a position at the table on the sidelines so as not to disturb other customers Dinner was great All very good I advise
Ive been coming back for years The owner Mattia is easygoing and willing to dialogue with the customer Very good appetizers also for honest prices The kitchen recommends eating spaghetti allo scoglio The friendly and active staff
Great craft beer bar Although they dont have so many Italian beers 67 out of 33 well thats a sign maybe that this bar is a genuine localpeople oriented bar Amongst the Italian beers you will find some verylocal ones Awesome PUBfood  stuff with an Italian touch Great service even when the bar is stuffed  A must have for every beer aficionado in the area
Excellent selection of craft beers from around Italy and further afield Burgers are awesome Large portions and about 30 different varieties of burgers including wild pork and fish burgers
Fob is a big restaurant that offers you a large variety of beers from a lot of countries Also serves good food that comes in big portions And has some interesting decorations with beer cans from around the world
Fantastic selection of beers and decent food The portions are generous so come with an appetite Prices are reasonable and service was quite good Only 3 stars because 1 Food could definitely use some seasoning 2 Perhaps suggestions of beer and food combination I liked the beer I picked but it didnt go with the food at all Book if you come at the weekend
Nice atmosphere good music very good beer  especially the red one 
Is there a job available for you
Awesome place to go out for a Double Saporito and XL lemon Tea but if love beers then go fire yourself up Good quality bit pricey but hey nothing is perfect Give it a shot well worth it 
Best Old Fashion English Pub One of the oldest in San Marino My favorite California SandwichLondon s Ice Th
An ok barrestaurant A server insisted on showing us into thepub There was no one there at the time but he offered us the choice of only two tables Would have preferred a seat by the window Didnt eat however the German lager was acceptable  though pricey  and came with complimentary crisps and popcorn
A great club with very nice people We had a lot of fun there and wish to come back sometime in future We were looking for a karaoke bar and accidentally found this one  we really recommend it And they checked our green passes  thats really great of them made us feel safer
Tasty food and quick service All dishes were tasty
Fabulous pub in Rimini Well worth a visit
A clean bowling alley with everything that is necessary to have good training or fun session Nothing too fancy but more than enough
As always very nice place awesome for families with kids all the way up to grown old ehmmm  anyway food is great just walk in the pub and let it roll Bit expensive but hey cannot have it all
Beautiful area Great Customer service  Call ahead if travelling hours away to ensure facilities are open Didnt open until an hour later than posted on website
huge arcade bowling alley with space for kids lots of pinball machines good draft beer and pub food
Dont eat here This place is an embarrassment to Italian food culture The reviews that says that the food is good must be fake The magerita pizza was absolutely terrible and the hamburgers tasted like seafood Confirmed mystery meat patties We couldnt even finish the meal out of pure disgust
Super tasty drinks and amazing snacks you get with them The choice is huge and staff is very friendly Loved it here
Perfect so nice and the service is top Such a good price for everything worth every penny 
Very nice place and delicious food plates come here take a drink and enjoy Grande Aperitivo Some drinks are very strong  the food is beautiful served and tasty It will be the night you never forget
Really nice place I defnitely recommend it for few good drinks The bartender mixes with taste love and style The waitresses are lovely and smiley real Italian treasures Make sure to take a Irish bomb for the latest guests they deserve it and the bar knows how to make them properly Recommend it surely Cheers guys
Nice quality and right price for food and drinks

Great cocktails
A restaurant which open early than other 1900 Inside look highclass  friendly staff with  speaking  Foods serve on times  ok  only not happy was the beer not come with full glass bubbles 13  base on it cost 67 dollars  Other things all good 
The best coffee in the center of Rimini The staff is super friendly and polite and they are ready to help you with all your needs And very important the food is really good and they made amazing cocktails
good piadina and great location the cheeseboard is ok
I liked this cafe Full of Energy and the cofe is  great Good serves
I dont recommend The service is not good waitresses is disinterested Food is good but not look like in a menu
The service here made me want to avoid this place Even though i live nearby and it is one of the closest places to come hang out i choose not to Ive been here at least 3 or 4 times and had the same problem The waitress has a really bad attitude towards the customers and even has fights with the other employees The food is okay nothing special
Good service the waiter would constantly keep an eye on my beer level and a big plus for me is the nonalcoholic wheat beer  The nachos were great but the fish and chips was a hoax the fish was the frozen type not made with proper batter Not acceptable for a proper Irish pub themed place Furthermore the beef schnitzel is seethrough There were a couple of folks having some nice looking sausage fries n pickles dishes  About the atmosphere the place is nice and could watch a rugby game however theres a noisy glass cube kind of terrace right in front of the entrance playing loud music totally unpleasant
The service was not that friendly despite what looks like a cozy old venue Lots of beer choices with guiness and local beer on tap we tried a whiskey cocktail but it tasted like mango juice jalapeno nachos were quite salty and the cheese and sauces tasteless
Black Angus steak  recommended Brisket cheese and fries also tasty Beer on top
Me and my boyfriend asked for the lunch menu The pumpkin soup was really liquid The 4 formaggio pasta was one of the worst plates Ive ever tasted It only tasted like cream and no cheese or salt The crispy chicken is much better on KFC for sure My plate was almost full when they picked it up and they didnt even bothered to ask what was wrong with it or why I didnt eat it Really disappointing Honestly just a tourist trap but the beer is nice
Everything that we eat and the service was amazing I totally recommend this place  Especially if you are a first time tourist in Romania
Beef Tagliata with zucchini and cherry tomato is excelllent I ordered medium cooked Very friendly staff Fully recommended
The food is full of flavors and the employees are open but still full of professionalism Its a lovely place
We stopped here for lunch Nice place and friendly servers The food was good
Huge change in fortunes here I visited 3 years ago and it was terrible  However now it is a super little place great decor reasonable prices for food and drink relaxing atmosphere with polite and welcoming staff if youre in the area you must drop in for some food and drinks
The food is very tasty The staff speak English and you can pay with card Prices are reasonable The special beef snitzel is very yummy The cheesecake is a must try too The only thing that I would recommend to the waiters is not to check all the time whether they can take your plates Not everyone is fast eater
Prices are way too high for this kind of food and dish sizes Guy with the sunglasses inviting people in is pure cringe  Good location
Great place to chill in the old town atmosphere is awesome The food was great proper fish n chips and the service was spot on They also serve nonalcoholic Paulaner which is my favorite The prices are a bit on the spicy side being in the old town
Good food good beer nice atmosphere Usually Irish pubs keep up the good quality Service could be definitely better but in my opinion its the managers fault not the employees Overall you can try
Very nice pub good rock music down to earth prices good beer and some interesting whiskies in their selection Most of the customers while we were there were expats or tourists but its really not a tourist trap They have another level under ground which seemed to cater for parties and events and different kind of music
Totally worth it The guy that served us was super super cool and polite The bug beer costed almost 2 euros And if you sit outside you have a nice view of the old city street while sitting inside you have a nice ambience Definitely sit there for a beer  if you are tired from strolling the old city
One of the bests bar in the old town Atmosphere is nice there are many options for beer food is very tasty and service is the best
A good place to have a drink nice view of one of main streets from Bucharest Old Town It is not a place for eating but you can grab something if you are hungry
Really excellent bar in Bucharests Old Town Good music and atmosphere Daniel is a fantastic host who made us feel at home with excellent advice on local craft beers and great conversation Best Guinness in Bucharest
One of the best places in town Food is delicious with a real irish touch Looks authentic and the personnel is really friendly There are nights with music and dance and nights with football games Whatever happens its always fun
Very nice pub really enjoyed the Guinness beer
Good beers and tasty food The local is nice and people too
Good imported beers variety Nice atmosphere and tasty food
Very nice Pub with friendly staff and good atmosphere The prices are really good for location of the Pub much better than the others They have really fresh Guinness
The service is excellent We chose this restaurant because it was cooler than the others from the area thanks to the water splashing the terrace The ribs were amazing and for me one serving was more than enough I also ordered gin Prosecco and the fruits from it were all fresh and delicious They were really nice and allowed us to change seats when the sun reached our table
The wine was awful but the service was good and its a nice location We only went in for the novelty and because we had time for one drink but I cant say Id be racing back
Hello  Visited this cafe 2 times already I liked the food with pork  Pasta carbonara is delicious  I didnt like the fish salad I didnt like the onion in large pieces and the salad dressing  but it is clear that this is all an amateur the staff is polite
Overall an ok place to go out with friends or discover Bucharests Old Town The place is neat spotless actually the bathrooms are clean and the service is fast The staff is helpful polite and speaks English There are some tables outside and frankly theyre more enjoyable the inside seating is more somber dark even making a sunny day not that wonderful The overall quality and experience is OK the only thing missing being more beverage variety The prices are high but thats the trend in the Old Town
Music far to loud no atmosphere very little air conditioning  and very poor choice of beers Took 15 minutes to pay avoid many  nicer bars in area
There are plenty of pubs down the street It is one of them which serves decent food and desert The price is more expensive as well
Lovely place and great atmosphere
Good food a multitude of tastes in one dish Excellent service many thanks to Miki who maintained the atmosphere and served us food with lots of smiles and kind words If you are good customers a row of shots from the house
Was there during Saturday the service was very fast i can say the burger was the best in town and the fries with parsley were amazing I totally recomand this place for burgers
Short story Food is tasty service is horrible  Long story I recently had the unfortunate experience of dining at The Temple Social Pub and while I must admit that the food was indeed tasty the appalling service left a bitter taste in my mouth My wife and I were excited to try out this place due to its positive reputation for good food but the overall experience left much to be desired  Upon arriving we were promptly seated and we decided to order both food and drinks To our dismay the drinks we ordered were never served to us We waited patiently assuming it might have been a simple oversight but as time passed it became evident that our drinks were not coming We tried flagging down a server to inquire about our order but they appeared to be preoccupied and rarely made their way to our table  Eventually after what felt like an eternity we went to bar to ask for our bill However even that turned out to be an ordeal To our dismay when the bill finally arrived we were shocked to see that we were charged for the drinks we never received It was frustrating to think that we had paid for something we didnt even enjoy When we attempted to explain the mistake to the waiter they seemed dismissive and uninterested making the whole situation even more unpleasant
Loved my time at The Temple Our waiters Mario and Alexandra were both great The food was delicious the prices were reasonable and the beer was great I highly recommend it
I stop by here every couple weeks staff is exceptionally friendly remember your drink and the sporting events are all visible on their 9 screens around the bar
Cool pub to stay at cocktails are good We went 3 times here during our trip and they openned earlier for us today because we wanted a cocktail after our walk  Waiters are nice 
Reservation is a must and come with 1 hour earlier at least 1 hour before a big game because they dont keep reservation even you have made one before for a specific time  Great place for atmosphere Average food Good beer Perfect for sport watching every kind of sport
Cool place to see F1
Awesome service nice atmosphere cool people
Great little bar with fantastic escape room above Good prices and friendly
One of the few pubs in the area Nice atmosphere good drinks You can order pizza from a nearby Dominos
Very nice neighbourhood bar and terrace Good products friendly and quick staff wifi device to call the waiter The espresso could be better
Great food and service best food we had so far in Bucharest
The baked potatoes with rosemary had dark spots which had a bad taste My stomach ached after eating them Really not recommend them
A twin of Primus but with different design Also cool and awesome
Read the reviews and walked here as close to my hotel well priced beer 18 each just dont expect the 2 change  and barman was friendly enough to be honest wished Id stayed for food as instead wandered to the old town which was a waste of my timemoney wouldve given 5 stars had the barman at least offered me my 2 change which I wouldve left him anyway
Great food the pasta is delicious The Sangria a must try it will send you right to Spain Thank you for the great atmosphere
Very cosy and charming location The staff was very nice and customer orientated we asked them if we could another table and even if they were booked they found a solution to accommodate our needs The ribs are amazing and the limonade unbelievable good
Its a nice place although it struggles too much to resemble a rural british restaurant Overall its very cosy and a nice place to eat something or just have a drink with some friends The food is very diverse ranging from appetizers soups pasta to grilled meat all kinds of fish dishes and other
A disappointed experience I visit it 5 years this time a overcrowded with a single person service an event upstairslong wait for food and over charge for a 2pers dish152leiin meniu 139 pieces of meat missed really awfully experience I have a 6years old cries for one mititel in that dish and theyre not willing to accommodate itA two persons dish should have two pieces of meat Very disappointed experience for service
TLDR version if you knew it and loved it its best to stay away nowadays  In the past 57 years this was a goto place for good food and affordable prices for city center standards Knowing that Im just coming from an embarrassing experience with foreign friends who were looking forward to the Romanian hospitality good cooking and the aforementioned decent prices  Apart from the general atmosphere which still works for the food and service we were provided we definitely paid about 34x the deserved price To showcase find the black tiger in the paella the prosciutto and pouched eggs in the breakfast plate
Its been a while since Ive been here but I was surprised in a positive way The food was good big portions The atmosphere is very cosy The people are very friendly I enjoyed my night out with my friends
Well placed in the city friendly staff Otherwise too expensive for what its being offered If not for the sweet taste the burger I had might have been good Limited vegetarian choice with average taste
Awful out of date food and bad service I complained about the thai chicken which is supposed to be a highly rated dish and they made no effort to put it right then continued to put it on the bill My partner ordered the ribs which was edible less than mediocre Lacks cleanliness too Loads of nice spots in the area this one can definitely be missed
I recently ordered a hamburger from this place and unfortunately it turned out to be one of the most disappointing meals Ive ever had The bun was extremely dry lacking any moisture and the meat was overcooked without any consideration for my preferred level of doneness as they didnt bother to ask Meet fell significantly short of the advertised 400 grams they claimed to offer On the positive side the beer I ordered was decent although it didnt do much to salvage the overall experience Shortly looks OK yet barely eatable
Later Edit  Been here again the food is goodvery good however not everything  We had a burger some garlic bread stuff and ribs The ribs were arguably the best in Cluj on par with the ones from Euphoria if not better However the fries that came with the burger and ribs were average and the burger itself was average the garlic bread  stuff was also really good  Good service good atmosphere overall a nice place to go to slightly crowded when sitting down  Happy to see it hasnt gone done in quality from 23 years ago since I have been here thats quite rare
The best Irish Pub in ClujNapoca  Authentic design great prices amazing pints and sizings good food in satious portions and quick serving  We had a mixed platter for two a club sandwhich and a chicken mayo with a brown big pint angelo porretti 4 and a papaya lemonade They were wonderful  1010 Would highly recommend
Great place to have a drink especially if you only speak English  Service was great and friendly
Food is flavorless cooked properly but it lacks flavour This place used to be packed with flavour but a few years flue by and chef might have changed Good deals for drinks
Very cozy place a lot of tables fairly priced The atmosphere is nice 70s to 90s music The toilets are pretty clean I usually visit this place for the spicy wings they are delicious
Location is great very central and accessible Food is good and portions are decent and prices are appropriate For instance last time I checked a beef salad had the same price as the chicken salad in some other nearby restaurants
It was difficult for me to accept that in a city like Cluj there still exist places where one can be refused their order I am vegetarian and even though I ordered a platter the server said he cannot serve just a side dish next to it I had the same issue many years ago but it was hard for me to accept that it is still an issue They only had meat dishes to be served by the sidesand they literally do not serve you if you cannot eat meat I could not believe it Romania is a country where people still fast  and the period is close in just a few daysand still they will not quit some absurd policies So disappointing And the restaurant was almost empty  incredible that they preferred to have no order at all due to a stupid policy
Service was great but only me and 5 others all night Tuesday is a quiet night it seems
We try to enter and they didnt let us in and the explanation of bodyguard was if u are not Romanian u cant enter without have a reservation I think this is honestly racist So dont came here if u are not Romanian Good luck and hope u will fail  maybe try to change ur bodyguard
Really liked having one beer on their terrace to continue our walk throughout Cluj  Four starts for not having any English  Irish tap beer the only tap is Heinikens Anyway having London Pride is a decent advantage
1 star because he doesnt let me in because Im a beautiful italian girl and maybe he doesnt like italian people so I think also he is racist Were serious by the way Dont come here also because one time they gave me hot beers
We had tea and cappuccino after breakfast  Super nice  fast service Very agreeable place to sit and enjoy the view  Only the choice of honey could be better the mixture of honey from several countries even continents is always a little dubious 
So we just passed on the street and they have a nice terrace between buildings that looks great so next day we went there for drinks The lady that served us was nice and also the serving was fast but I guess theres no way you can delay drinks I tried CheGuevara cocktail was nice The nonalcoolic coktail Cuban Love was too sweet for my taste but there is not much you can do We also had Cuba Libre  not very good From shots we had kamikaze and B52  were very good We also tried a strawberry beer I didnt feel the strawberries We didnt try food but I have seen at the table next to me some ribs and looked great They also have terrace outside with view towards St Michel Church but in the terrace back is a better atmosphere
very atmospheric place  mostly people come here to drink but we ate and were pleased with the food
Not worth it Awful service Better go to McDonald Cheaper and the stuff is nicer and you will get the same size or  even bigger size of burger  I have never had that small  burger in the restaurant Service is awful I have never been served as bad as here Dont expect to be seated No one care about you No hello no smile nothing and when you approach them they ignore you go away or stand and do nothing If you dont want to be a Waitress just change your job Not give this awful attitude to the guests Food was okay nothing special but I will remember how angry the stuff was
Nice big restaurant with a nice outside terrace Starters were excellent
Cozy place with a big terrace for summer The staff are OK the server we had was a little forgetful and it was harder go get a hold of them  Their Gin Tonic is good and the Negroni is on the sweeter side  The food is good they have options for just about anyone You can share their appetizers we had the cheese and cold spreads one everything was of good quality  I tried the Hanger Steak which was cooked perfectly medium rare I am usually not a fan of anything rare but I actually enjoyed this a lot The Artisanal sausage was good but nothing amazing and a little but dry  I remember the duck being much better last year but now it was quite salty and not soft  The Orzo and Salsiccia is amazing and you should definitely try it The Stuffed Chicken was also good  The disappointment for me was the Tiramisu which is not one at all Its biscuits with whipped cream and nutella Thats it They should change its name so as to not be misleading  Overall good location near Central Park On weekends you might also share the place with people that went to a wedding in the park Highly recommend making a reservation
Went here for some beers in the afternoon Has a nice open terrace with good ambiance Personnel was very friendly Cant say anything about the food as I didnt eat here but the beers are great and the beer menu is extensive
Great location with the outdoor area being renovated since my last visit Busy with lots of customers and plenty of staff Unfortunately some staff need to he aware that without customers they dont have a job and respect them more 
Very overpriced for what they offer 18 lei per shot We ordered 12 shots which was 216 lei They made shots and instead of offering to us quantity that they made additional barman choose to throw it in sink dont get me wrong but they shake 2 alcohol types and one syrup  so why to throw it when you customer paid you so well Music has a bad quality for sound and inside smells very mold Do NOT recommend even once to go there And also the attitude in your reply justify why you deserve 1 star Best regards to your management
One of the funkiest bars in Cluj they shine out by having a huuuge shots menu written across a whole wall It is also famously popular with students and tourists alike A party place the atmosphere was really good everytime The bar queues are long sometimes
My visit to this cool basement bar was marred when one of the barflies or staff tried to follow me into the coed toilets when all the rest were unoccupied not ok They made unwelcome comments when we left too We had only stopped in for one while visiting Cluj for a friends birthday had been no bother Ladies beware
Lovely pub great atmospere cheap JD
One of the best places to sit outside and enjoy a drink in the old town due to the fact that it is airy and not cluttered like the rest Love the pub quizes that they organize weekly
If you wanna a whiskey go to Londoner Pub
Great cocktails The bartenders can make you cocktails that are not in the menu if they have the booze available Best place for Quiz Night
Friendly staff and interesting cocktails
Probably the best restaurant in town when it comes to food qualityserviceprice relation Menu has it all from cakes to soups risotto fish Huge portions great price  Sports channels all day  Great job guys keep it on 
One of the best valuefood places in town Really fast service excellent food big venue nearby parking and reasonable prices
Food came out pretty fast and the guy serving us was pleasant and helpful
I entered the restaurant and got a table for me and my friends and near the table from the plants or whatever there was a yellow liquid leaking secondly if you look up youll see pipes and the air vents they only have frozen food from what weve ordered i dont even know if they cook in here tbh which food is almost below average so my advice is dont come here if you wanna have a good time
Great place with great rock music alcohol and great atmosphere There are lots of great rock and metal parties and concerts and fun rockers
Great metal pub friendly staff cheap beers closes at 5am perfect for a Rock n Roll night
Awesome people great drinks great music  Mikes pub is the place to go at least once in town 
Good music decent prices but its pretty dirty
Great place to grab a drink The food is also really good and the staff is always super pleasant Highly recommended if youre out on the town in Cluj  Headsup though they dont do reservations No knock against the place its their choice I guess but that means it can get pretty busy and youre not guaranteed to find a table especially on the weekends
The steak is not a real steak Feels more like a diagragm but still very tasty Overall a good experience with great service as the staff is very friendly Prices are maybe the best you will find downtown Cluj and theres lots to choose from The menu is awesome accurate description of the products lots of details on the online version Its a big place so it takes a while for the food to be served but its a great place to hang with your friends
Great food for a good price Friendly atmosphere an unpretentious place I dont smoke and sometimes it is unpleasant that smoking is allowed inside a roofed terrace It can be a little crowded and loud but in good company these things go unnoticed
Very good food and many drinks to choose from all in the city centre and for lower prices Definitely will come back to try more from the menu 
Its not the best experience I had the America  steak but it lacked taste and the meat felt old as it was very chewy The place was quite loud so I would only recommend going there with friends not adequate for a date night As many people were going out on the terrace it was also pretty cold The burger was decent and the desert was tasty The reservation was also easy and the location  is convenient Prices are also reasonable but overall I believe that the experience was in the lower half of what Cluj offers
Modern a bit like US diner style restaurant with a great terrace Perfect for a nice summer day The California Burger was excellent
I got the Springtime Burger and it was amazing Honestly the fries are probably the best ive ever had secret baked parmesan on the outside The staff was also really nice and it was great to sit outside under the umbrellas
Really cool bar and restaurant Fun stylish design inside with a great theme iykyk The staff are all very friendly and helpful There is an excellent beer selection including Ursus draft right from the tanks above the bar I also love the greenery behind the bar to give a nice ecological feeling The terrace outside is big and spacious and very comfortable Didnt eat any food on my visit so I cant review that but the menu looked really good The wifi password also gave me a good chuckle Would definitely come back here for another pint on the terrace or comfy seat inside
Ive been a client for several years now and I can sincerely say that besides an irreproachable service and a welcoming atmosphere Shto bar is a place where you can find a community either by participating to quiz events or by simply hanging out with your friends on a regular I have witnessed many friendships being formed in Shto while also having the opportunity to meet a lot of interesting people in the last couple of years  To conclude I would definitely recommend you give it a go and who knows maybe you will end up with some long lasting friendships and some fun memories worth sharing with others over a glass of wine or a beer 
Pretty cool place Serving both delicious meals and a variety of special beverages Delivery is always on time and has great music playing in the background  Varied crowds  nice friendly peepsespecially being in the center and staff where you could have plenty of hearthy funny and unexpected convos Would recommend 100 for an enjoyable experience
Very rude staff asked us to move to a smaller table even though there were plenty of free tables moved upstairs and it happened again The waitress called me passive aggressive because I couldnt understand why we were being asked to move again with plenty of free tables in the establishment We ended up finishing our drinks outside the bar Very strange experience
It is a nice bar right in the center of the city The atmosphere is buzzing and you feel comfortable The toilets are in a bad shape and it feels cramped if more people go in the same time We waited for a long time to get our dinks at the table and we were ordering some whisky but the staff couldnt remember the name of it so they keept coming back and asking us again which one was it We ordered without ice but we got ice in the glasses Overall it was a good experience
If you want to get drunk this is the place Beside alcohol drinks they make good coffe with a lot of syrup You do not even need sugar Important notice pizza is all the food they have
Rude staff and average drinks
It has indeed a warm environment good chill music polite staff and the prices are okay I recommend this place
Cozy good for groups works best if you reserve your table
Our walking tour guide pointed this place out very interesting concept  Super friendly staff great chilled vibe and very reasonably priced Romanian and international beers Noroc  Rock music and a young crowd 
Last nigh with my friends we set down to  one of my work colleagues table on the terrace and the waitress said to us that she will not serve us because we joined the table of some people we doesnt even know and she already reserved that table for some loyal customers In the mean time another table got free we moved to that one we wiped the wet table from the rain and moved it 10 cm to avoid the rain to fall on it again The waitress came again and she told us rudely that she still not serve us because now we moved the table and that is not allowed At this point I requested for a manager and she refused to call the a manager I went to the bar asked for the manager I tolled her what just happened and she did nothing just telling me that I lie I was a loyal customer in this place I ignored that the orders are served after half an our no matter the day or the time you go there or you are just ignored when you sit down to a table But what happened last night was outrageous and inadmissible If you dont like your job or you dont give a damn on your customers find another job Some people want to go out to relax not to deal with rude people
Amazing coctails great staff cool music and ironic design Started my evening in another place and regret that I didnt pick this bar in the first place Just try it out and enjoy
The place is amazing Huge good prices It is a punk like pub with style Keep up the good work Also they have electric sockets to use and portable powerbanks
Ordered some food from them on glovo Its not the first time Ive eaten here but the delivery food quality was much worse than what I experienced in the restaurant itself
EDIT We came on August 5 around 5pm  After ordering a beer it took a girl 20 min to realize that they dont have it They didnt have the next 3 we asked about either although the online menu didnt say that they were out of stock like it did for other items Finally we found a beer that they had but the girl brought us another one after 10 more min I told her that its not what we ordered she looked at me and left And we were left with an opened beer that we didnt order After half an hour my friend had at least something to drink The place was not even half full Also my iced coffee came without the whipped cream and syrup like it said in the menu
One of a kind in Cluj of alternative places Great staff great interior perfect coffe and nice crowd It was cool already in 2008 when I visited the place for the first time and its still cool
The atmosphere was amazing Service not so much Cool place needs better service Didnt eat just had drinks Waited forever for everything
We spent several happy hours here this afternoon before our flight home Awesome place with great steampunk atmosphere and trappings and very tasty food
Very cool looking place with great music  The burger was pretty good but not amazing The fries were excellent and I also recommend the nonalcoholic cocktails I had the Green Apple  Service is very good and the staff are super nice  Ask to see the moving mechanisms
The pizza was not that great We had the Pizza Suprema and the Bacon and Cheese one The ingredients were average quality and the crust needed a little bit of flavor In regards of quantity there was enough corn and mushrooms on the Suprema and bacon on the other one maybe a bit to much and the tomato sauce was not to my liking The service was nice always with a smile on their faces and polite
Great service and nice coffee  Spacious area inside and out  Cool decorations
Going there once a month Its a cozy little pub with good selection of beer and other beverages Staff is also pretty nice although sometimes it can get slow on busy days understandably
I absolutely love the service i never felt closer to any bartenders then i have in this place Completely recommend
A nice place with nice staff Dimmed lights music is ok Good for hanging out with friends and enjoy a friendly chat The design of the pub has nothing special fortunately it has a good variety of beers and at a really great quality although the prices arent higher than average pubs and bars from Cluj
Nice bar comfortable chairs outdoors helpful and friendly servers plenty of beers to choose from
A nice place before 11pm when it gets full of people  because of the weekly parties organized here Its a nice atmosphere with good music but it can get too crowded sometimes The prices are good enough for a student The food is tasty but the burger is not the best choice You can try crispy strips Nice place overall
Okayish place for partying if you come without expectations Horrible security and odd rules though like no drinks allowed at tables outside etc
Great food for the price nice decorations packed whenever is a party Great place to go to for having fun
Sat in the patio area  very nice Tucked away from traffic Place is in the university area so prices were very reasonable Just had the local home brew was not disappointed Offered a good variety on the menu Waiter was attentive to customers Would return
Very lovely place with cool atmosphere where you can enjoy listening good music and why not sing a karaoke song with your friends Will definitely return there 
This was my favorite bar in Timioara Great atmosphere and awesome staff who can speak English No snobbery or rudeness and great selection of drinks Thursday and Friday karaoke are tons of fun Check their Facebook for live music Definitely recommended if you like a hometown feeling bar with great service
Karaoke nights very nice
Good and friendly staff artist oriented place with Chat Noir references limited choices on the menu though fair price list  average price is about 15 Euro for a pint of beer  If you want to snack on something they serve nachos with salsa sauce
It was last evenings awesome experience A wonderful atmosphere smells like new all over the place Special dishes and of course the Guinness beer Service was very nice and helpful Recommend this place
It is a regular pub like any other Food wasnt great wasnt bad The drinks were a bit pricey I ordered one drink and got the more expensive version not the one I picked But it was OK overall I wouldnt pick it probay wont go back but I wont avoid it either
Great pub  with interesting name a charlatan is a name for a person who claims to possess knowledge and skills which he is aware that he does not possess
After waiting 20 minutes to receive the menu we had to wait 30 minutes more for someone to take our order food arrived after another 45 minutes We asked for 2 charlatans burgers one well done and one medium We received 2 burgers with raw meat one burger was cold and the melted cheese was already dried out fries cold too the other burger came with boiled potatoes sunk in oil  not fried at all Its the 3rd time i come here all times food wasnt well cooked and ordering takes too long Sorry but this was the last time
Really great place cozy ambiance kind and attentive staff the food was delicious the beer fresh we enjoyed a lot our dinner thank you
Nice Location for a Team Event Menu available in English Service speaks English Food takes a while however the quality decides not the time to wait The Group of 15 was served in one go with hot food drinks was taken care frequently  noone was thisty  Great choice
The highlight of the lunch was the fantastic lemonade Personal kind of rude forgot to bring the extra request and the food was not good and it was also cold There were only a few customers in the restaurant not rushed hour or anything Price does not match the level of service or quality of the food
The food was really good and the burger portion my friend took was huge They have interesting options of Romanian food The place is cosy right in the heart of the city center The service was also good
This has a great selection of beer from around the world So if you crave a home made beer you will probably find it here In addition to that the waitresses are kind careful and the place is happy and full of snacks So enjoy
I had a very pleasant experience here The decor and sandwiches are not impressive but the place is very customeroriented and the staff will do everything to accommodate you I felt very welcome Will definitely visit again
If you ever want to spend an unforgetable night in Timisoara this is the place to come to It is a place that brings back to life the best rock music from the past and they have the most various types of beer that youll ever find in a Pub Every friday and saturday there is live music so all you have to do is bring the good mood with you and a big appetite for beer A small minus for not having any cooked food except for sandwiches and nachos but old Mc Donalds is close by so you wont suffer from hunger Enjoy 
If i wanted to listen to epic vara  music id go to epic vara  80s pub has changed  It used to be a diferent kind of music Thats what made it 80s 
Excelent bar The bartender was a gentleman He may seem scary but he is a top shelf gent my compliments to the chef the drinks are well priced after a night out drinking the overall price was Way lower than I expected overall 5 stars all the way Keep it up lads
Great food and great athmosphere especially in the inner yard
Nice pub Good location
Very nice place and good food
Poor service horrible food I read the reviews and was looking forward to a nice pub for dinner after an 8 hour ride through the rain on my Vespa  First disappointment was I couldnt sit inside Door is locked and I was told it was closed Ive been in the rain all day and now I have to sit in a damp garden and listen to the traffic on the street after listening to traffic for 8 hours  Second disappointment was the burned hard as a rock bun I tried but it was just too hard And the patty was tasteless and a little raw in the middle I like a medium rare burger when the meat is fresh not frozen  Now my hands are sticky and I cant get a napkin The staff is too busy eating and drinking  or thats the appearance I get based on the food and sitting at tables meant for customers  I wish I had gone to McDonalds to satisfy my burger craving
Poor service mediocre food I had to wait 15 hours for a dessert in an almost empty restaurant where the only waiter was having 10 minutes breaks in every 25 minutes And the best is that you can only pay by cash or Revolut Not shady at all
Charlie I know its not your fault however I d like to share your opinion with us about this threes who were savagely cut right in front of the pub Timisoara is going from bed to worst regarding protection of the nature We the citizens should do something the administration of the city is going nuts Please help us to save the Timisoaras threes
The place is named after a dog which is usually outside next to the terrace Sometimes the staff walk him out and he is just adorable They have a wide selection of beer You should also try the burgers A few years ago they had live music with small local bands not sure if they still do it Also they usually play football matches here so if that is your thing its a good place otherwise it gets pretty loud so during those nights you might want to go elsewhere
Only had drinks here but good service seating outside as well as inside
Probably the best burgers in town
Arrogant waiter After 15 min waiting to take our order he was but hurt that i order stuff Not to mention that the table was dirtier than the floor 0 stars sadly is not possible Edit Fun fact that arrogant waiter was the so called owner so if the owner treats its customers like this what else is there to be expected
Great atmosphere at the weekend Nice DJ Oldies but goldies
1110 experience for an evening out with friendscolleagues Great music choice great service great food One of the best pubs I had the pleasure of spending the evening
Nice service 1 June  childrens day  got free juice and a nice pancake We enjoyed the place
Really really good burgers and fries  their food in general You get a lot for the money and everything is made by them The togo packaging is also really cool Couldnt recommend this pub enough  What I can recommended though is that the waitresses should be just a bit friendlier they can give you the high hat at times for nothing
Great vibes Good value per money Polite staff I recommend this place for going out with friends
They did the best they could with what they had Furniture is nice Service as well Menu looks good too
Your local bar Best in this neighbourhood Not the best overall but your best choice in its area Your morning coffee is waiting for you here if you are around
Not the best location but good fries good beer and a cosy place for a drink with friends
Este ok Numa bun de baut o bere
The food is good and with a fair price Be sure to take some cash because the pos conncetion has problems I went there two times and couldnt pay  by card
Orderd twice from them great meniu choice to start with Both on delivery through Bolt Food where we got some crazy good price deals so that was a clincher Also both came in aprox 3040 min so that is a plus First we ordered two breakfast dishes which were both very good secondly ordered for dinner Had a VIP burger that was very nourishing and a Chicken Quessadillia to share as an appetizer which was sooo cheesy and good Contrariwise I had some Tagliatelle with shrimp that was unfortunately not that surprising as the rest of the dishes too much bland butter sauce with garlic and too little spicery Also says it has zucchini but couldve been more generous with that Will definetly order again from The Tube
We went at lunch very crowded We ordered the menu of the day in order not to waist a lot of time The waiter was trying his best but he was overwhelmed The soup arrived after more than 30 minutes we did not get what we ordered but did not return the plate as we did not have time The cream soup was not so good The second plate was ok but also took a while before served Food is average but I do not recommend to go in rush hours
Most people rush here for the daily menu which is quite good actually Went here twice had the house burger the second time An okay experience overall just nothing more Average  Service takes forever Waited 25 minutes for the waitress on Tuesday July 4th
Awesome place awesome people and amazing food A spot where you can drink coffee tea and alcohol drinks All the food is prepared with the best ingredients and the taste will make you asking for more They just updated their menu and its even more tasty
The best burger by far in town U have to try it
Relaxing place delicious burgers with good french fries  lovely owners Recommend the spicy burger
Best burger and best beer chilling place and good staff
Best in town Wonderfull staff grate food but the best food is SeaFood  fresh and juicy
Decent food but overpriced for the quality limited beer  drinks selection The only plus is that this is good place for large groups They dont accept credit cards
vote 1 because you cannot give 0 waiting for two and a half hours and food arrived at the table still frozen after the wait and the quality of the food there was not even 1 lei discount we paid full price to eat poor food arrived at midnight we were not given even a bit of bread in the endless wait dont go to this place  bad value for money
It is beyond me why you would wanna come here repeatedly The staff is friendly and helpful but the food is really not good Granted I have not experienced their  la carte food but only their event catering Ugh Plus the patio gets really hot in summer because of all the concrete and stones
I was in this Pub on 4th of September it is nice and the staff are good and friendly with good prices But there was a group of about 10 people who are too loud in talking and annoying others I personally had to put earplugs to avoid the noise No matter how big the group is as long as you control the conversation and not annoying others They were acting like they own the Pub and they dont care about the other people
Lovely bar Great music Nice selection of drinks including shots Although the bar tender was attentive and friendly we didnt like a 15 lei tip was added without asking onto a bill for 3 drinks So be weary
This restaurant is located at the beginning of the Main Street of Brasov Their staff are quite friendly and speak fluent English We stopped for a quick lunch We ordered local beer and wine and a beef burger and some chicken breast food was beyond acceptable Worth visiting while in Brasov for tasty food and a beautiful Brasov atmosphere
The service was incredible and Sonia was amazing and very friendly My friends and I went on a trip to Sibiu and stopped here to have lunch The food was tasteful and it was served really fast The atmosphere here is wonderful too The only thing that holds me back from giving them 5 stars is that some drinks were not as good as we expected Nonetheless we had a great time and totally recommend it
The people are nice the drinks are hot and the sandwich is tasty Also they have a DJ with good music Its just a nice place to relax and enjoy the winter sun
Good music  good time
Nice staff Great place to take a break Maybe a better selection of sandwishes would be great
Great vibes craft beers
UPDATE THIS IS FOR ZORBA THE GREEK  Not Bridge Pub Really love this place The food is great and theres a lot of different dishes The new restaurant is practical and we personally love the decor The staff are very friendly and  made the visit easy considering our limited Romanian Going back soon

Nice place to hang out with friends it has a lovely terrace and its located in a beautiful area of Braov

Great place with an impressive selection of craft Romanian beers Very reasonably priced Nice outdoor garden with a view of the mountains
A bit unusual design mix of different styles not everyones taste Not mine Good beer average hamburger standard pizza Good place for drinking but not for great eating
Aftar Stube Bar in Brasov is simply exceptional The atmosphere is captivating offering the perfect blend of comfort and excitement Their collection of Romanian craft beers is a true delight for beer aficionados complemented by a menu of tasty dishes dishes The staffs warmth and knowledge enhance the experience even more Dont miss this hidden gem  its a mustvisit in Brasov
Good prices nice chill vibes The staff is very friendly and easily to talk to The drinks are very well made and even the on the house drinks are very much appreciated Fully recommend 
Michael is the best bartender Very helpful and professional staff and great cocktails
Good for mornings coffe or happy hour menu Alone or with friends everyday a good place for a drink time coffee tea or something strongly 
The server was very nice the burgers and sauce tasted fresh and home made which stands out besides common processed taste
Very nice restaurant great food and creative menu
Nice mix of delicious dishes friendly staff  great music and contemporary design Its  hard to find a good veg burger but they nailed it And the apfelstrudel is better than everything I tried in Vienna
Nice experience the terrace outside is 100 pet friendly The waiter gave our puppy a bowl of water The food is nice and the prices are normal
We had BRNO Burger and Pulled Pork Sandwich from their menu It was the most tasty burger that I had in a long time and the most authentic pulled pork sandwich that you can find in any Romanian restaurant Usually the Romanian chefs tend to cook according to the Romanian taste but here we could find the American taste in food Not to forget to mention that the waiter was kind and helpful and very  pleasant to us
Nice but understocked pub
Welcoming atmosphere

Great atmosphere
They serve different kinds of excellent beer including local brands Interior is interesting with good music
Great place for a drink and awesome music quirky and super friendly vibe
A fun bar with good music Great atmosphere Every drink I tried was good
Good beer and other drinks Very specific climate If you looking for a good place for evening its there 
Found this place on a google search for the wheel of beers However they dont do a wheel anymore or is a metre long board now with 11 beers on for 99leu  Although we didnt eat here the food looked good The atmosphere was busy It had a smoking and non smoking area We was with a smoker so this kept him included in our group  Very helpful weightier amd even got me candles for my girlfriends birthday in the morning
Cold refreshing draft beer  in Braov old town We order CIUC 1 Liter 199 lei and 400ml 99 lei Check the size of glasses  Cool vibes 
Came here twice during our vacation in Braov and we were not disappointed The varied and delicious food nice staff and the location itself make for a very succesful meal The chicken schnitzel with sauce and garlic potates was the best Also bonus points for having cats around
Very nice place friendly staff for English speakers and really nice traditional food
I really liked the chickpea curry I got with basmati rice and garlic nan  The waiter was especially kind and asked my preferred spice level and made it happen Indian spicy level hehe Their terrace has a nice open vibe I fully reccomend 
Amazing beers and incredible Bloody Marys with great service highly recommend
Great pub with good bartenders and well made drinks
It says it is open till 2 am and me and my friends grabbed a cab to have a drink but bartender told us that it is closed and it was 1244am
We only had draugh craft beers no bites but the menu pressented a variety of pizzas snaks and yummy confectionery The staff and cat were extra friendly and caring The cozy terraces one under a canopy of trees and one under a pergola made our stay a wonderful experience Serving was exemplary restroom clean friendly atmosphere and the volume of the music allowed conversation to flow naturally I strongly endorse this establishment
Best pizza and romanian craft beers in Brasov Super friendly staff and great atmosphere Oh and btw its pet friendly
Intimate pub offering a good choice of local beers Very nice and helpful staff Nice place to rest in shadow during Brasov sightseeing
Great spot to stop in for pizza and craft brews Nice outdoor area under the trees along with indoor seating Good selection of craft beers from local Brasov brews other breweries in Romania and beyond Service was friendly and helpful with the beer selection Our pizza was delicious and came out promptly
We went for a hike in the mountain and me and my friends were looking for a place to sit for a beer and some light snack We found this cool place in the plaza and decided to stay Not long after a waiter came and took our orders Very attentive fast service and good quality food The location itself is very good as it is in the middle of a busy street I recommend to try this place Amazing
Its a beautiful and chilled place to enjoy a cup of coffee while you watch the locals passing by It is located in a lovely street in Braov downtown and they have this Lavender Gin and Tonic If you like GT you should definitely try this one Very refreshing drink Enjoy the local cuisine and have fun in Braov
A soft location You should pay attention because it is at the 1st floor and the entrance is through a alleyway with stairs At the top of the stairs the first door to the left 
Nice atmosphere good food Went in the morning so I dont know how the pub works in the evenings
Great place Tasty food and drinks Very good service Recommend Will definetily be back
Enjoyed the afternoon watching the football only downside was it was quite cold inside but apart from that the barman was friendly and the beer was cold
Today two times here morning caff ristretto  excellent  evening draft beer and fingerfood  very tasty  and last but not least  friendly and professional service nice atmosphere  congrats
Good beer good snacks great music Still the same The finest pub on Lpuneanu not only with a good variety of beer but with a very nice selection of single malt whiskeys
I see many complaints about the staff But you must understand that if youre acting as a peasant they will treat you accordingly  Its really that simple   From my point of view this is one of the friendliest places Ive ever been Clean decent prices and pretty good music The perfect place to get out of your daily routine 
Best place to spend a night with friends accompanied by good old music 
They staff is very very rude and if you try to suggest any song to be played they will call security on you Please I urge you to not come to this place Only cheap peasants come here and music is for them
Nice place located underground permits you real evasion You will forget about anything going on outside cold snow etc The music is OK  the average age 18 to 30 years old Go see have an experience
I dont really know about it during the day honestly Ive never been I love this place for its Latino Dance Party on every Thursday hosted by Magnitude Dance Fiesta Latina is the best Latin party in town if you want to have the time of your life dancing salsa bachata and kizomba
Its decent and is well located in the Palas mall area The dj plays nice songs but has to listen more to the beats and learn to harmonise the transition and mix Service is ok not hyped but not happy to have you as a customer either Its a good place to get the groove on and move somewhere else after 1h
Save the date 7th of January 2017 Crapiest music ever The dj have to practice some more on his skills and harmonic mixing Even though the place was half empty the waiter forced us to spend at least 300 Ron on drinks at the beginning of the night that was at almost 11 oclock Until 1 am half of the people already left maybe because of the music
One of the worst pubs in town No ventilation working only 2 or three types of beer and sometimes its not even cold Waiters are always grumpy and takes forever to bring you something
We went for lunch Even it wasnt full they served quite late even the daily menu Food was tasteless Some chicken wings had taste of fish The American BBQ ribs were fat and tasteless The cooling is done by some hanging air vents but they not enough on hot summer The service was ok
The placr is usually very crowded and the service is slow because of this Otherwise the staff is very nice I like that they knew off the top of their hat which menu options were in stock and which were out
What kind of serving is this The beer is more expensive than in pubs in Dublin but the quantity is far from enough 6  for this one I do not recommend the place
Great cocktails Liked the Margarita and the Byzantine
Amazing experience best food in Iasi reasonable prices great deals and good staff Their gin tonic cocktails are also fantastic Cant wait to go back
Fun place its one of the few places in town where you can watch sports Other than that its pretty bad the food is mediocre and on several occasions Ive waited close to 30 minutes to place an order when 3 or 4 staff are just hanging out behind the bar talking to each other and playing on their phones
Fish   chips was to die for for  Fantasic  Guinness was lovely  Friendly staff  Overall very happy
Very Lively Seats were mostly occupied on a Wednesday night The guy working there was very nice and helpful
Waiting for one hour than left as not even the lemonade was served
A place where you go and the bodyguards are not very welcoming they reject you and tell you to wait at the door even though the club is empty high prices on the weekend very disappointing
Nice beer and food The fish is great
Nice restaurant Good food drinks and atmosphere
The name says it all A bar terrace for youngsters Unpretentious good place for a glassbottle of booze and a laugh Nice staff
College bar is the perfect place for students to hang out between classes The food is not too expensive and it tastes great All burgers are very tasty but sandwiches are a tad bit small Moreover drinks are not too expensive as well There are many types of cocktails soft drinks beer which is great The staff is very very friendly I totally recommend this place There is also a terrace for smokers
Was a nice place to see the students and support the student bar
If you want to feel young and enjoy a tasty burger alongside a good selection of drinks this is quite a nice place to enjoy the atmosphere of Iasi as a university city 
Want to meet new people or just need to chill Wanna have a cold one or some hard spirits Wanna boogie or just relax on a jazzy tune Well this is the right place friendo No food doe
You will wait a whole lot for someone to attend to you at the bar when its full 2 out of the 3 people working the bar usually being in break that is if you dont offer them a little something like a little tip or a drink You can get out to smoke or for some air with your drink only if you put it in plastic cups at the entrence The atmosphere is pretty neat tho
Bodyguard beats people without talking first My boyfriend was knocked out 20 seconds in front of the entrance because the bodyguard saw us going to the bathroom together He didnt say anything to us to leave or anything at all He just threw him out and started beating him until he passed out  and then went inside without even checking if he was ok Horrible experience considering it was the first time that my bf came to Baza  Edit after the reply It seems you are talking about a totally different event as the one I am talking about resulted in no arrests date 29 April because nobody else was aggressive The womens bathroom was completely empty and we were absolutely nonviolent with the bodyguard or anyone else He didnt askedinvited us out he violently grabbed my bf without saying anything he hit him in the back of his head and threw him out resulting in him falling and hitting his head on the cement He passed out for 20 seconds in front of Baza and a young couple that were the only people standing outside helped him to regain consciousness After some time another woman came that was our friend There was no police the bodyguard immediately went inside and nobody tried to hit him and after my bf woke up we just left to find our friends We are aware that were not allowed in the bathroom but we were having a bit too much fun We had no idea that instead of asking us to leave  your employee will leave us unconscious on the floor Please consider a different approach for non violent persons at least as next time they might not wake up
Nice drinks and you can put your own music
A nice bar cheep and good location
Covid free 
No investment has been made in the toilet for at least 20 years
Very arrogant waitress Effectively the menu is for nothing as they only have 3 things on it anyway And seriously 4 lei for a cappuccino in an envelope
Great food  drinks very nice atmosphere good music and service
Incredibly tasty beer beating in quality many artisanal beers in the US The very diverse types of beer  Maybe 20 or so are produced at several brewing sites of the company and distributed in select places in Romnia but also in exclusivity under the labels of prestigious brands in the Netherlands
A nice atmosphere lovely deck The food is decent but not great Prices are too high for the quality of food and location Are at the same level as Fenice at Palas Mall The staff and serving are great
Cozy place nice music good beer selection The food was tasty We went during the day so it wasnt too crowdy
Very nice place but there is space for improvement The menu is confusing and some drinks we not availabile The music si boring and too loud its a Pub there is not that much space Its more of a place people would come to talk make jokes and such over a drink so the music is not helping
New in the city Modern and cosy 
New kid in town 
You see it
Amazing dishes and polite personnel Best soup ever evereverever Also best service we got in our 5 day stay in constanta I dont know why all the people are so agressive in this town
Delicious food smileing and welcoming staff great music
Modern interior design in a relaxing atmosphere with great food and drinks chill out music for an amazing go out with friends and family
Cool place to meet up or just have a coffeedrink Music aint loud so good for conversation Tried the food today and it was quite nice too
Great place to go have a cold one and great food Atmosphere is chill for the most part Staff is friendly and food is good Nice hang out spot for a drink with friends That seafood plate 
Mix between a British pub and a local Romanian type restaurant hence the missing star for atmosphere Was expecting a more authentic British experience but hey not everyones into that Nice drinks selection Very good food selection Has an entire Ghost Pepper food section ribs wings burger etc Overall great place
Nice place in Constanta  The foods was amazing delicious Had some problems on the fitness salad they bought it pretty late but in exchange for small trouble they bought shots of something to the whole table 8 people  The staff was quite good fast on reauest but also funny  Surprinsingly affordable The terace was a blast We felt incredible good
I really enjoyed it thereA wide variety of food and drinks  Amazing design and really cool music Going back there soon
1h to wait for 2 burghers And fter waitress checked it was just the next one on the list Or maybe forgotten
Lovely place with tasty burgers for everyone Take your time and youll be amazed
I made the order on Glovo for a Double Trouble burger I received it in a very very bad condition the first if I made the order take it and its the last and Im very very disappointed with what I received have a little respect for the customers please at least a little
Never order food from them Apparently the food is only good at the location but when you order via delivery I cannot guarantee the quality of the food When you order a 50 lei burger but the quality is worse than an 810 lei burger at McDonalds then something is clearly wrong with that restaurant 1 The bun that crumbles instantly after you take the burger in your hand has a horrible taste apparently its normal for it to be sweet and taste similar to bread left to mold for 3 days in a row 2 The meat is not even half a centimeter thick although a burger should be at least 2 cm apparently what I ordered is a smashed burger even if this is not mentioned anywhere in the product list or in the product title  false advertisement  3 They changed absolutely all the ingredients compared to what they used 1 year ago  the quality is noticeably worse If you want to eat the worst burger ever try ordering from a burger pub and youll really see what bad quality means when you say everything is expired
The place is not so bad The stuff is either a little too cheerful or a little too sad and indifferent It took an extreeeeeeaaaaammmmmnnnnlllly long time till the food arrived and it was quite cold the taste really had potential We were with a dog and the storm was coming  they let us in with the pet which was quite nice The place was absolutely empty despite 2 3 regulars The price is a bit too high for what they offer
Absolutely loved it here The waiter had a great vibe the music here is souuuuul The food is amazing and we did not wait much We also had a guest at the table a cat who joined us by sitting on a chair and wait for some foood Of course we welcomed her with bright arms and gave her fish   Later edit here again Definitely favorite restaurant here in Constanta I will attach more pictures from these days
The food was ok We had some beef stake I can say that it was eatable The waiter didnt ask how wed like the stake to be but medium rare is the safest way to cook beef  The place wasnt at its fullest but it was really crowded and it took pretty much time to give the order But they have good quality drinks I mean the bottles not the bartender preparation  good music and the place looks a little vintage and it feels very cozy I will surely come back to try some drinks and maybe different food but to feel again that vintedcoziness 
VERY BAD EXPERIENCE They keep deleting the review i will keep reposting it Food was okish not great a bit salty but not nearly as salty as the staff Very rude condescending and ill mannered staff and let me tell you why On my visit there i arrived with a friend of mine who is priest and was obviously dressed as such At first we thought the waitress was very new then we thought she was on drugs or similar due to her behaviour and the way she spoke to us when she took our order  While we were eating the waitress came from his back with a full bowl of boiling water and spilled it all on my friends back there was no reason to think she tripped as she had nothing to trip on and we were not sitting in anyones way so she had to go in between tables to reach us and also she did not lose anything from her tray it makes no sense unless this cruel joke was fully premeditated it is unacceptable this discrimination and religious hatred in 21st century Europe  More to it none of the staff expressed any surprise not the person who burned him nor the other members of the staff nor any apologies for what happened to the priest not even to ask him if he is ok or to bring him a towel to wipe off the steaming water from his cloth He went for medical check as we left and had severe burns on the back of his head neck and his back from this incident but curiously he did not want to press charges  although advised to  Would NOT RECOMMEND anyone to go there  food was not bad bit salty but not as salty as the waiters one thing i would never understand is how are they allowed to serve when clearly they have antisocial and maniacal behaviour because i went there with a friend who is priest and came dressed as such during our short visit the staff was rude and condescending one of the waiters even faked tripping and spilled a full bowl of boiling water on his back could not believed my eyes as she went away without even saying sorry or asking if he is ok did not even provide him with towel to wipe the steaming water off his cloth nor a chair to replace the one she got wet none of the staff expressed any worry or sorry The priest did not want to pursue this and did not press charges although they certainly deserve it Obviously I DO NOT RECOMMEND any sain person to go there Shame
Superb 55

Cocktailuri foarte bune privelite superb i personal amabil
Gorgeous view
Scammy prices and behaviour regarding the pricing The pizzaburger offers were not applied they changed their mind and had no clear prices We were not served the drinks menu the prices being pretty much random i guess  The food burger and fries came colder than my dead grandpa  sorry i highly recommend to try the other places around with more reviews The lemonade was good the only good thing
Ordered a Tequila Sunrise and a Pink Gin tonic for two 10ml of alcohol added is an overstatement Then we ordered a Kamikaze shot Felt like a shot of lemonade with no alcohol At least the shots of pure tequila were ok They couldnt wash those down What a joke Very friendly staff though
Messed up 2 rounds of drinks Then the service got extremely rude when we tried to actually get what we ordered
We sitted ourselves and picked up the menus from the side table at the entrance because we were never greeted Waiter was not rude but mentioned that they only had pizza to serve which was a lie because 20 minutes later he was delivering hamburgers to an outside cubical Waiter never asked if we needed anything else I had to get his attention if I needed something else
A great relaxing atmosphere with interesting interior decorations and good lighting choices The menu is decent enough to cover most tastes and the wine selection is equally good The pub also features a small stage for live concerts mostly targeted towards rock Highly recommended
Place is decent but they allow too many people inside And dont get me started on the music Not sure where they got the DJ from but if you like the 90s you will love it here I dont
goodmuzic goodvibes lovelypeople perfectplaceforlovestory
The place has a lot of potential unfortunately it is ruined by the awful djs whom purposely make it so that the music drives the people out I mean take a look mr dj and see no one s dancing on the oldies you re playing and even your enthusiasm is showing Le He can change italthough this time it took him a bit longer that it should
Really good food We all ordered burgers and loved them one of the best burgers Ive had actually However the cocktails were extremely strong almost undrinkable
I randomly decided to sit down The burger was great but the fries were seasoned perfectly and wonderfully crispy They have Guinness too Definitely recommend
A decent place with good vibesThe food ordered here was quite tasty We ordered grilled chicken and French fries which were a 55 Also we had ordered liquor which was very reasonably priced Also the waiters serving were very polite  Do hop in here if youre around
Great place for a beer andor burger Nice selection of beers from different countries The vegetarian burger was delicious  light but still filling I liked that you could choose the type of onion in the burger red caramelised or pickled and the side French fries or chips Really good fries and the ZigZag sauce Not expensive at all especially for this location and sizes of portions Definitely recommend 
The shrimps were veeery good The waiter recommended them and it turned out that he was right  Also the fries were quite tasty
Great service and excellent food
Very good shrimps indeed the best Ive eaten so far The drinks were quite good also they also had a DJ and the misic was a little too loud for a place without a dancing area D
Great atmosphere and food One of the real nice places in Constanta
Amazing hospitality coming from a tourist By far the best Caf not just in Constana Its very cozy and it feels like home
Loud music cool environment Somehow was there in a karaoke night the singers were quite good Some nice pool tables five I believe But totally occupied for the 12 hours I spent there So try to book in advance dunno if it possible Have to check their rooftop next time
Clean and sober Probably too sober for a Cafe But is general trend so it is just fine for a quaiet time and a chat along a good coffee served by smiling faces
Good food Great ambience
The services were fast the food what miraculous and delicious the price is very affordable for the amount of food you recivehere is an example of pork ribsexceptional  I recommand 
Humus and burger were really good Tiramisu was way too liquid definitely not what it should be
Great food good prices friendly staff a place to go for having good food
Does not have all the items in the menu although the food was ok Pay attention the waiter will add 10 tip on the bill without asking
Great Playlist Chill atmosphere Right plate to have a chat with the bartenders I really enjoyed their company Good prices  Location is not great but is a good tradeof for the small proces  From time to time they have livemusic So stay tuned
Great place great beer professional and friendly staff  the right place to spend an evening  advise
Nice place GREAT MUSICK Friendly stuff
Had a great time listening to Bucovina
Near the park right on the main road you can find this great place The interior is very nice and there are also tables outside Unfortunately you hear all of the cars passing by but all of this is forgotten once you take a bite from their delicious food  Dont miss the garlic potatoes they are great great The tomato soup is very good tastes very good well made and also looks nice  A great place for a beer and some food Definitely recommend this place
very good reastaurant the prices are normal the meals are tasty
Food was delicious The salads great Drinks even better some of the best Craft Cuba Libre Another Round and Mai Tai weve tried Overall impression  great
Normally  the coffee is very good opening the venue at 8 oclock but serving breakfast from 9 oclock is very unpleasant
Nice and cozy place to grab a drink and some food far from the busy part of town The food isnt something to write home about but its definitely OK and reasonably priced
Cozy wood panels design lovely stuff terrace and good food
The music is good the food is good Not to many beer options but it is ok As a minusit is a little bit tiny But definitely I will visit it again
Cozy neighbourhood pub with good music cheap drinks and friendly staff  The food is ok just not the salads  who goes to a pub for a salad anyway and they have a great variety of homemade snacks
I know this restaurant for a very long time was a nice place with very pleasant staff a place to spend nice time with friends I dont know what happened over the time but today was a very disrespectful staff and they claimed that they have to fallow a stupid rules from the management I dont know how to say but definitely Ill not recommend anymore My advice just stay away from this place
Food is good but the staff is impolite They put their tip in our bill without us knowing as we payed via card
Very good decoration ambient and also very good food If you are near try this restaurant you will not regret
1 star due to disrespectful staff most of them are just rude and showing a poor level of education Its a shame since the food is good and the atmosphere is ok
Nice 
Ok
Nice place
Ok
10 out of 10 serving experience The stuff is very nice and helpful
Good food beautiful ambience  You can watch a football game here on a large screen TV  You will find here a good offer for drinks and the prices are right  All of the above are not enough to come back if you have only one unpleasant interaction with the owner in a drunken state and this can happen quite often  So be careful  I will never go back there
Cozy atmosphere a nice design with warm materials like timber exposed Tasted some medium quality boiled wine Not the best place to work or concetrate in the evenings because it is so crowded and loud you should remind this is a bar and not a hub or coffee shop for working remote In the morning is quite and a good place to work though All in all a good experience
Excellent pub right next to the Romanescu Park biggest green spot in town This place has a warm atmosphere very kind staff good selection of beers and spirits great music mainly pop rock blues and alternative and also host of some happy felines It also has a nice terrace greenery and covered by a huge walnut tree for a perfect shading in the summer
The waitress was quite insensitive The raw food when I called her to see the problem she nonchalantly told me that she didnt cook it and left A gross insensitivity Just sit for a coffee and a cigarette I dont recommend it Im sorry I cant post a picture to prove it
The menu of the day ends immediately you wait 15 min for a waiter to come and take your order 30 min until he comes with it Even if he has an ok position the services are below expectations disappointing  I do not recommend
Visually pleasing very good food The waiting time was a bit long and the AC was not turned on
Great food and very kind staff recommend
Very kind staff very good food and enough to fill you up the menu is perfect to be accompanied with the good beer they have Its a great place to hang out with friends
Prompt service and very good food dont miss the pork burger
Very pleasant atmosphere super good food pleasant atmosphere and a very friendly staff I recommend 
I ordered amatriciana pasta and although their menu says that they are with guanciale instead of guanciale they had kaizer which was not even well fried it was more boiled horrible I understand that its hard to find guanciale but at least dont put it on the menu if you use kaizer
Me and my friends came here for a few drinks Located in the beautiful center of craiova The drinks are reasonably priced maybe a little more expensive than nearby bars The staff are very friendly and the service is rather good The hot chocolate is amazing if you are used to drinking hot chocolate in the uk this is like drinking hot chocolate milkshake it is very thick and rich in taste They also sell a range of cocktails cider and beers Also the music is not to my taste sounds rather generic and doesnt have any popular songs playing
Good fun Nice bar Highly recommended Great Carlsberg 
The place is well set up has alot of room and nice decorations The service was very good and the staff friendly The choices on the menu are good and if you need any help in choices it can be offered by the staff in being able to craft your type of way
The place ist pretty  but the service has no clue what he ist doing there The music is nice  but the drinks you ask for are replaced by drinks they want  they make really bad drinks
Really good hot chocolate The place is nice and cosy Great energy and smiles from the waitress
The perfect place to hang out with your friends Amazing food and a cozy atmosphere The staff is very friendly and that is definitely a plus Would recommend it to everyone
A great place to hang out with friends in any season of the year Pretty diverse range of dishes great cocktails and a very pleasant atmosphere Positioned in the heart of the Old Town in Craiova its a mustsee for tourists and locals alike
The order came in 1 hour but only half of it the food was horrible with bad quality ingedients no straws or teaspoon for the drinks Not coming back



Ok
Ok
Ok
Ok
Absolutely loved the vibe of the place and the house brew called dont feed the cat Its super informal yet somehow special
The best venue to spend your evening out in Craiova Lovely garden and relaxed atmosphere Eclectic rock musicVery good selection of craft beers from the Hop Hooligans brewery
It s a nice bar Cheep shots tasty beer I loved the salad and the corn dogs Music is perfect I feel younger whenever i go there
Very nice place offers a variety of drinks both alcoholic and nonalcoholic The vibe of this place is really special and unique the lights are incredibly pretty and make the place more lovely Of course the best thing about coming here is the spoiled a bit fat but simply charming cat  Misha which every visitor loves




This is the right case to say Dont judge the book by its cover Super tasty foodvery rare to find nowadays PS Igor Chivser
A very ok pub the food is good and personally the service seems very ok to me I have already been a customer for about 2 months and they have not left me with a bitter taste For haters who have something with the serving staff 1 as long as you are waiting for 5 restaurant services from a pub put your appetite in the cui 2 think that there are 5 tables with similar claims its not salty enough etc often being just a waiterbartender Im curious about your reaction speed and not to count it as many times you dont think that x person is standing and trying to make you leave with all this so fuck off to all the haters because it really is a cool place With the awning on the terrace its also not their fault but you can complain directly to the company that owns the restaurant Peace PS my menu small portion 27 lei plus beers around 70 lei
I ordered now through Tazz for the first time Beef soup parmesan potatoes and chicken breast skewers Ill show you what the chicken skewers menu means Basically3 small pieces of chicken and the restvegetables My first and last experience with them
This is how a plate for 4 people worth 120 ron burns
Food and drinks are very good price is reasonable



I came to this small town three years ago no matter what time of day you dine no matter whether it is full or not the place is quiet and comfortable This restaurant is my first choice for business talks and gatherings with friends I cant explain it I just like it if I like it
They have tasty food cooked right with qualitative ingredients The service is also good and reliable the location is nice The youth seem to enjoy this place a lot The prices are medium to high depends on your order
I ordered humus and the salad part was a bit under my expectations certainly not looking as in the menu pictures The foccacia was a bit too dried out
Been here a couple of times but Ive been disappointed on both occasions I wanted to give this place one more chance but will NOT come back View is nice but food takes AGES to arrive and its not even of good quality Do not recommend
Excellent place Toto the host has pride in his work Very friendly Good cook Next time im in Ploiesti I will come back Thanks Toto
Very nice atmosphere and music The staff is extremely friendly and helpful The prices are quite decent for a centrally located venue
Not easy to find but great atmosphere
A very nice place with friendly staff Perfect for grabbing a cold beer with friends on its terrace in the summer and in the winter to have a boiled wine inside
Nice friendly staff Good place for relaxing
Great hot chocolate quite different than usual but I certainly recommend it
Nice place to get a cup of coffee If you are a smoker you can smoke outside in the improvised deck Even in winter its heated  Downrated to 2 stars after they messed up my order two nights in a row without even saying sorry  PS  They dont know the difference between dense and liquid hot chocolate
Ive been here a few times and every time the service was pretty bad Last night I saw an emtpy 2 ppl table and I asked if I could add 1 more chair and the response was and where am I supposed to pass by After that I observed that there were 2 more empty tables that they the 2 girls that worked the shift were saying anything about so we were about to leave when we noticed and asked about them All night they didnt empty our ashtray once although it was full they didnt come to ask us if we finished our drinks once we had to look for them all the time and they were impolite The drinks are good and the bar is nice but just for this I dont think I will be going there again
Super location food at 7star level as well as service and atmosphere Well be back as soon as possible I recommend to those who are picky
Our office is next to the restaurant we eat the daily menu here every day or when we cant find it anymore we order something from the menu The food is very tasty the service is quick and the staff is kind
The best frapp Ive ever had It has the same satisfying quality every time I come A very friendly and professional staff excellent food
I ordered the menu of the day besides the fact that the food arrived in a maximum of 20 minutes the food was excellently tasty still hot the portions were very large I did not manage to finish the second course Qualityprice ratio the food seems extraordinarily cheap compared to the quality and quantity I will order again with love and confidence I recommend
A relaxing place with good music perfect for young people Those willing to experience new things at Jordan House they also have hookah for 25 lei  the price of flavoring and charcoal can reach 4045 lei I recommend this pubclub 
Beautiful location fff food hello and the patrons are extraordinary people Grade 10
Pleasant atmosphere super okay staff hookah and good prices
A lovely secluded place for young people He also has hookah
Great atmosphere and great music all rock all the time concerts are held here by various bands the service or menu is not that great but this place has been my favorite hangout ever since my University days
Awesome metal music Perfect ambient and really good food Host was polite Recommend 200
Quite a nice bar with a good atmosphere went here with some Romanian friends the back garden is really great Dont know much about bars in Ploiesti but this one is a place to see
Best food and lounge
Not a bad bar at all Lot ofdrinks to offer good Beer and fair prices I was Just missing some people wednesday evening and almost nobody inside
Good drinks but staff could do better Some drinks in the menu werent actually available Staff could do better Facilities were quite poor  But the beer we had was good so worth giving a shot
Not a bad place especially for students to have funBut the quality of people they let in can make this place inappropriate and uncomfortable to enjoy especially for women
Crapy service and music The place is nicely decorated but the music electrotechno poor quality is not consistent with the decor with soft rock Execrable serving  had to ask for the waitress at the bar after we waited 15 minutes when we ordered they refused to serve us cocktails and some of the coffee specialties and tea because they do not have time to preparebut half the place was empty  It was first and last time for me here
You can enjoy a good cup of coffee while watching the beautiful center of the city with many historical buildings It is also close to many turistic locations In hot days it is a breezy place Unfortunately the waiters are not very friendly
I ordered a classic lemonade  I got a glass of water with very little lemon juice  Prices are of course like in the city center  The products are worse than in the slum
Pub with good music and artisanal alcoholic drinks
Super slow service servers not serving  they just left things middle of your table And beer wasnt cold They were rude  Update for this comment  a blond lady come and fight with us and they kinda forced us to delete this post I never faced this kinda situation before It was nightmare  Pointing out people not cool I know but in this situation I kinda have to
Great place great service Visit any day there is always a party inside the place is nice and welcoming the terrace is awesome during the hot season and the location is unbeatable
Nice Irish pub right in the center of Oradea Nice atmosphere quick service and nice music Of course drough Guinness
We were on the terrace the rain was coming and they closed all the umbrellas casually leaving us unprotected Is this respect for customers
A good little pub that you can enjoy
Excellent food Everything is freshly made and the food came out hot Everything was so tasty from starter to desert The restaurant is huge with a bug terrace and has a lot of items on the menu Service was good and staff friendly
Food was good but rather disappointed in the service When the bill was ready I have asked if we can pay separately as we were a group of 8 The waiter said bluntly No I said then how are we going to pay for the bill individually I was told that the person who booked the table should pay which obviously should be up to the group of customer whohow they decide to pay If this restaurant really doesnt have the option to split the bill which many other places has then is NOT actually a great place to go as a group and should find a reasonable solution to split the bill
First time here today and by the time I got in the place had  a warm feeling Food was absolutely deliciousthe service was exemplary and the drinks were nice and cold Value for moneyi give it a 910 ai overall very happy Wherever you look you get suprised by somethingmaybe the bootle chandelier or the old bear mugs on the wall but definitely a place I wanna come back too Huge space and everything is properly decoratedI would highly recommend this place to anybody who want a warm cozy meal Keep up the good work guys
Beautiful spacy place to have beer and amazing food They offer beer food like crispy chicken burgers ribs etc as well as many delicious salads smoothies meet meals soups pizza pasta We were kindly surprised 
Great They have quiz night karaoke open mic Its a cool atmosphere
Quiet classy place with great music Has a wide selection of drinks has board games for customers and they let you bring food from outside
Terasa este noua au foarte multe jocuri precum monopoly si catan  Thr terace is new they have lots of boardgames such as monopoly or thr settlers of catan
Was not really happy with the place The design and drinks were nice but all in all there were some difficulties with the proper knowledge of the temporary staff
The fact that you are charging an entrance for entering a regular bar is just embarrassing Also there is the fact that its quite unsafe to use those stairs on a Saturday night
2nd time here  just as disappointed as the first time 
Cosy friendly pub in the Black Eagle gallery It looks like a ship great design touches and wonderful service
Great place nice people and a good atmosphere Cheap drinks and nice people made my evening
Now this is a really nice place that you should visit
Gr8 show
The house of the Rebbe of Vizhnitz in Amhashak Ehvat Yisrael
fun and good cheer at the Impro Patzan shows And for the rest an atmosphere of relaxation as between friends
This bar is literally a scam we paid 60euro to security guard for the entryit was a fully empty inside we thought it is a live music bar but they scam us we are really disappointed  This restaurant must be shutdown I wish I could get my money back 
I visited this establishment yesterday and encountered a highly unpleasant situation The owner decided to kick me out solely because I was wearing a cap There were no prior warnings or explanations as to why wearing a cap was an issue  I understand that some places have specific dress codes but I believe that at least a brief explanation or time to rectify the situation would have been far more respectful to a customer  This incident left me disappointed and I do not plan on returning to this establishment anytime soon I hope that in the future the staff and management will reconsider their approach to customers and treat them with more respect and understanding
We were a big international group that entered an empty bar to drink We ordered drinks for everyone As normal nowadays a few went out to smoke After sometime the security guy started to ask for an entry fee we left to the next door
Quiet when i went so quick service Dark inside Drinks ok but not a place to come for food
Sweet place awesome staff and atmosphere Happy people having a great time Very inviting customers that loved to meet new people
The bar is very cute and the owner is super kind great place to watch any sport would definitely recommend 
Small but fantastic sports bar that plays American football games live Can only hold maybe 30 people on the first floor maybe double that in the basement Watched the Super Bowl here with a bunch of locals AND paid local prices Only issue is since NFL games run late at night they have to close around 130200am due to noise ordinance laws Otherwise worth stopping in if you are in the neighborhood
Great little hole in the wall sports bar Good bar food excellent prices also

Great place
This place undaunted by cool trends and sad gentrification of the city is the heart quasi spoiler the other way around of the beautiful intimate and triangular Dans la Ville blanche by Alain Tanner With a Bruno Ganz  sad loss  to whom little can be added except that he is very young without knowing him I would dare to say that he plays himself and the Portuguese Teresa Madruga It is worth the visit to confirm that time stops there or even goes against the current If you havent seen the movie dont miss it
Lovely spot for a postwalk beer We didnt eat but the food also looked good Great selection of drinks and well decorated Loved it
Casa Do Fauno is a great hidden gem from all the touristic hectic hecticness in Sintra you can come for a fresh pint some coffee and cake or their awesome Tostas  You can definitely wind down and enjoy some great space  They also have a shop upstairs where they sell Christmas and incense among other things  Will be back
It was a very nice place and I liked the atmosphere of it if you are really into geltic stuff this is your place only down side was we could not get any food cause their toaster was broken 
Amazing location excellent staff Pay a visit to the little shop warmly recommended to bring home a piece of this lovely place
Solid bar with a big range of cocktails Blues rock playlist and sport on the TV when we were there bartender was charming and accommodating Bonus for being the only place open this late in Sintra particularly on a Sunday
Love Bar Fonte da Pipa Amazing atmosphere top tier music and service This is a must if youre visiting Sintra and want a low key amazing drink spot Intimate and cozy wholeheartedly Got some great drink recommendations too
Really cool bar with a unique interior  AWESOME MUSIC an extensive drink menu and small plates too The bartender was super friendly My husband and I had a great time relaxing drinking sangria and eating a tasty charcuterie board while watching a Portugal League Futbol game Great time
Excelente place for a delicious drink after exploring the magnificent Sintra We had an amazing charcuterie board called Smoked sausages with some warm buttered toast  We were served by Bruno who went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed charged our phones gave first aid to little boy who had fallen and whos father came in seeking help as he couldnt find a pharmacy and kept us entertained The decor is very cool and we got to sit on a very comfortable lounge arm chair Prices are very decent They only accept cash but there is a ATM next door
Such a warm and happy place as South Africans just looking for a watering hole it was the perfect spot Such a friendly place to be with staff giving proper banter and making us feel part of the regular crowd Great cocktails and mocktails real Irish charm will be back as often as possible
This is the best place for a good night out wether you want to watch a game we came for a rugby game and the energy was so awesome or the live music it varies day to day Ive never been disappointed and the servers are a good banter Summer or winter this is the place to be
Very rude service We were told go somewhere else were full Completely understandable if theyre full but absolutely no need for such a rude response Just walked round the corner and other bars were super hospitable
Good Irish pub with great beer and lovely bar staff Didnt eat so cant comment on the food Kitchen closes on the early side
Great Atmosphere Staff is friendly and music playlist is excellent Great spot to have a Guinness
One of the servers was so rude that he would not take the ashtray from our table when asked and then when we offered to pay he snubbed us and laughed and said whatever you want to do inside or out and walked off Very insulting and and total disregard for customer service This person either owns the bar as he was doing shots inside or should be fired Dont go here There are far better pubs with pleasant employees
Lovely Irish pub Good variety of beers ciders and spirits The food is quiet good we had the classic hamburger with chips and the ham and cheese toasty Staff is very friendly and the prices are absolutely  fair
Cool little British Pub in Cascais steps from  Praia Ribeira
Incredible Bar in a beautiful part of Cascais The owner is a great guy who serves even better drinks If you like good music and having a laugh you will love this place
It was an incredible experience They bar is lively the drinks are fantastic the staff is so accomidating  they have every sport you can dream to watch I highly recommend this place The icing on the cake is everything is so cheap
If youre looking for NFL games in or around Lisbon this is the spot The owner moved tables and got us a spot by a tv just to watch the game This was while a huge introLisbon soccer match was on every other tv We were the only people in Cascais maybe Portugal who cared about the game we watched and the owner gladly tuned it in for us What a great guy He has all the games 100 would recommend
Good place for a beer and relax with rock and roll
Cozy place and good variety of beers You can relax drinking and listening to some jazz
Very nice place to be with friends to drink some beers or a good caiparinha along with some original Portuguese food The burgers are magnificent The vegetarian burger is almost better than the original We will be back sometime
excellent local joint good food nice staff and beers great place
The Beer Hunter is a very unique bar with an oldschool flavour It also has two outdoor spaces You have the opportunity to play Billard or Snooker inside the bar I recommend you the delicious craft beer called Pato
The perfect spot Every evening i stop there to have a drinkalone or with family or my friends The view is amazingthe staff is amazing and very polite Everyone that visit Estoril must stop on this location I highly recommend
Walked by it every single day we were in town and finally had to stop From what I can tell dont stop here for a real meal maybe a snack Live entertainment was really good and found the spot relaxing But drinks are the order of the day Note to self Never start a sentence with the word but
The rude waiter was stoned and talked to her friends for 40 minutes after we gave our order We asked about it twice but it took an additional 15 minutes We and her friends were the only people in the bar Felt like a waste of time
Its a bar drinks ok but dont go there to eat food was very pretty much unedible very disappointing
Great drinks and good live music It would be 5 stars if they didnt look the other way and allow people to smoke inside Its a small enclosed space and to share it with smokers is very unpleasant but  to be fair  that seems to be the norm in Portugal even after the law that forbids smoking in closed spaces passed Shame
If you are looking for a late night drink when visiting cascais this is the place to go
Good Music  great ambiance  great staff   Well  good for all ges   20ish to me   40ish    Musical selection is GREAT 
Thats an awesome place to listen to a good music and have some pints with friends Ive been there few days ago those guys on the bar smashed Bar service is great too
A dartboard in Monte Estoril Whats not to like Good service and great place to catch up on American and British politics as there are numerous world leading experts who happen to live in the area and attend this bar You dont even need to sit next to them as their volume allows everyone in the vicinity to be enlightened by their insightful and brilliant opinions Incredibly there are also world leading epidemiologists who also live in the vicinity and can share their deep researched knowledge on any pandemic that happens to be the occurring 
Is a great bar the best in Cascais Coast
Quirky pub and very friendly staff and locals Good value and great to stop for a couple and have a chat
very chill local spot  relax have a drink enjoy
Staff was nice and friendly Beer is cold and 15 Its a good place to drink but food was not that good We had chocos fritos and they were frozen from a supermarket packet no taste at all and expensive for what you get
First time at this lovely bar last night  We sat outside had lots of wine and gorgeous food  Was a fantastic experience  Thank you Shauna
Cosy great service good price Only tried the drinks though Nice Gin and tonic
Small little bar with typical Portuguese tapas great spot for a beer and a pint
Such an amazing place to have food and drinks Staff is great and make sure you reserve a spot Food is amazing too
The view is amazing The food is not As you see in the picture all looks good Not sure the orange Juice is realIf something is homemade its even worst Nothing is tasty Croissant overcooked and hard Very very nice place that deserves better kitchen And surprise on the ticket Tips are added automatic 10 in my case I will go in the evening for the cocktails but the brunch doesnt taste what is looks like
Im sure the food is good but if youre going just for coffee better make sure you can take the eye looking from the staff It was raining and lots of wind so couldnt enjoy the view from the terrace but that might be the one thing that is amazing there By the end of my coffee I felt it was a bit pretentious hence the low rating
Went at a time when the place was nearly empty Nonetheless everything took ages from getting the menus to getting the food Initially they rudely said they didnt have our reservation but I had a confirmation on my phone We werent allowed to sit under the parasol because there was a reservation that specifically asked for those Ok no problem Well the only problem is having a rooftop restaurant with only two small parasols during the super sunny and super hot Portuguese Summer months Food was unmemorable and totally overpriced for what was served Orange juice was sour and when we complained the waitress said the oranges were off season It was July Two kids at a nearby table also told their parents the orange juice tasted bad Waitress with her huge nails had a hard time placingremoving things from the table and seemed to be totally bored Another waitress was chewing gum and blowing bubbles Really
The food was really good the waiters were friendly and the view was also nice During our stay we were the only dinein guests which made the experience more exclusive
Waiter must warn about this ridiculous 5 card limit They took my money for not providing any service food or drink Robbery
Amazing beach side restaurant Good views Diverse cuisine Pizza available Very friendly staff
Delicious food and great staff much more that I expected from this place Prawns 1110 
Super cheap disgusting cheap compared to many places in Lisbon Mixes foods and drinks the toasts are cheap tasty and absolutely massive The music is varied but always pleasurable and not too intrusive you can smoke sit and there is enough space for everything
Drinks were very good but unfortunately people smoke in there
Bad experience  1 Bad service  2 People smoking in a closed space
Chill out bar Cool to meet drink and have fun Pretty girls in town a place to see
This is a London style pub food menu located in Lisboa airport and an extremely nice respite from the craziness outside Orders are taken at the counter and brought to you once prepared which keeps the process nice and simple We had the Fish and Chips and the Shrimp Linguine and both dishes were great especially for airport food Only comment is that the shrimp had not been deveined which I am not a huge fan of Other than that the restaurant tucked away out the back and out of sight from the entrance was calm and comfortable and definitely what we needed before our next flight Would stop by again next time we are transiting through Lisboa
Horrible horrible food Service is awful as well I knew things would be overpriced but I expected a little bit of quality We could not finish our meals because they were so bad Probably the worst airport dining experience Ive ever had
I found the food and drinks amazing The service while not five stars was good And the place as a whole was one of my best airport dining experiences something that is essential if your flight is delayed like mine was PLUS I got to watch the first part of the England  France game seated very comfortably and surrounded by other football fans It also helped to have a screen inside the place to see the status of your plane
Do not eat here ESPECIALLY if youre in a hurry I had two hours and somehow they still made me late There is one serve for the entire restaurant even when its busy I was NEVERA checked on So I had to fight for attention to order my meal drink and pay I asked for a small discount given I had such a bad experience and they refused All employees r male which are inherently let attentive Cannot tell you how BAD of an airport restaurant this is
I was there for a little bit until I met tue owner Hes an incredible guy full of stories Wow What an incredible place Totally recommend 
Poor service bar tender makes it seem its a huge burden to be working there which is unpleasant Easily not returning This rocket will not leave the ground
Been there 3 times in 2 weeks and 3 different prices for same drink seems like a scam
Nice outside area the employees are very polite
Experience your beers where every can has a story Snacks mostly
I loved it As soon as I arrived right before the openig hour they instantly greated me and offered my dog a bowl with water Right away asked me if I needed anything else like water or something refreshing  I ate a mozzarella and prosciutto which was lovely and very crispy and the coffee was splendid  Thank you so much for your hospitality and see you soon
Been here a couple of times First was a Friday night had a couple of beers and a free shot of pipoca which was good
Great selection of craft beer
This place is so nice and chill The sushi is just ok not really special The staff was first so great but after not really If you can find another sky bar its much better to sit
Beautiful views Ive been here twice during my time in Lisbon The staff are quite friendly The atmosphere and ambiance are wonderful  very laid back and relaxing A great place to hang out with friends or just have a calm moment to yourself perhaps before grabbing a bus out of town at the nearby Orient Station  I will say the first time I came here it took a while before I was served maybe 1520 minutes although it wasnt super busy The food made up for it though I had the ceviche  amazing and worth every penny The fixed lunch menu 1230330 MF as of June 2023 is also fantastic and a LOT of delicious food shrimp tempura starter sushi main course dessert and a wine or beer drink for the 25 price  While food and drinks are on the more expensive side if you know that before you arrive you at least know what youre walking into   Food is fresh and tasty and I couldnt be happier
Absolutely amazing experience Beautiful views and a great staff Honestly Vaz was the true reason for this review He went above and beyond to really allow us to fully enjoy our experience Food was delicious and ambiance was beautiful Thank you for a great dining experience
We had a reservation for 16 people The service was very slow and we had to remind several times about the drinks we ordered and didnt get The food was just ok the prices were not too high although What we went there for was definitely the view It would be nice if they added more warm dieshes on the menu Also we were seated at 2 tables 8 people at each It felt too tight like sardines in a can and we had absolutely no space for our plates and to sit comfortably We would need an additional table
One word  Awesome

Sympathy all around Genuineness Craft beers Masters in haircutting Everything mixed together contributed to an excellent experience and top service Be it to drink a jola and relax or to cut your hair In my case both 
Amazing Cozy space Impeccable staff Everything always with good energy Good fines Reference spot Thanks
Funny
The best bar with the best service ideal for any type of person with the best music They make you feel at home
Definitely  The best bar in Bragathe best staffthe best atmosphere Obligatory meeting point for Latinos  Keep it up Greetings
Horrible venue horrible music with very highpitched sound Very poorly attended
I went to F with my friends to watch a Portugal football game and dinner For appetizer we asked for Ovos Rotos that were well served with good and tasty ham For main course I chose Pinga Amor and it was one of the best burgers I had really well put together a great Hamburger beef bacon a fried egg and a good mixture of sauces Really flavorful that will make you feel good after the meal not heavy Everything was brought really fast with little waiting time The staff was helpful and checked with us many times throughout the night It is a good place to watch football with friends
Really good francesinha with good options for desert starting the meal with the free shot made it all much better
Amazing value for quality  Shrimp and Brie were amazing and junior service even more Would definitely recommend Great place in braga
They moved from Makro and opened here The space is very cool and the food is also quite good The ladies serving us were super nice and the prices are accessible
Not too crowded on a match day There are two screens and one is delayed than others so not a good way to watch football if you sit the other side
Fantastic pub in Barrio Alto Clubs and Fado joints surround this friendly outpost The employees are not Irish but thats ok they have the friendly spirit to make everyone feel welcome Plenty of sitting at the bar and some high tops Soccer is always on the two big TVs inside and some good music is usually playing Cocktails are simple but generous Excellent whiskey selection Jameson tullamore dew johnny among others Guinness Kilkenny and several other Irish and American beers are on tap with a knowledgeable staff to serve you Just overall a great little bar to try  I really enjoyed my visits to this location and would come back anytime Im in Lisbon
My friend and I went to Lisboa for 6 days as soon as we found out that if you want to party you have to go to Bairo Alto we went there five nights in a row We found this Irish Pub and stayed there basically every night to party and meet other people  If like Guinness and good service go there  The Barkeepers especially one guy with shorter hair are very nice
No food available or at least I do not know about it Smells funny inside Good bar however would only recommend it for football games
The best karaoke pub in the world  The staff made everyone feel welcome and took great care of us  The Karaoke DJ did a great job of keeping the music going and the crowd full of energy  I cant wait to go back
Great pub karaoke on one side and live music on the other bar staff all really friendly our fave pub
Best Karaoke Pub in Lisbon Anyone who loves Karaoke this is the place guys  With full of Worlds most friendliest staffs here You will have guaranteed fun  Strongly Recommended
Super ratchet inside with karaoke  Beer is only 4 per glass and they take credit card  Most people are drinking outside because its too hot and crowded inside To take the drink outside you need to get a plastic cup  The restrooms are in front of the entrance I think there were double doors
The service is not very friendly and quite confusing you are not allowed to pay by card for less than 5 euro Also you have to go to the cashier to ask for your service and then go to a bar to get your drinks which makes you feel not very welcoming Overall the bar is ok but a bit dirty as well
Best Pub in town My favorite snack is Jalapeos with chili sauce always blindly ordered virgin cocktails from them and its always so gewd And dont forget the weekly pub quiz for free shotscocktailsbeer for the 1st and 2nd winners
Excellent pub with a lovely menu Best fish and chips Ive had in many many years  I will go there more 5 stars
Great service nice people delicious food and the best thing Pet friendly  my dogs loved it they received lots of love from everyone there
Was very nice but now service become to worse side Changeg commentars We asked personal a lot of time  reaction  just a finger  waiting Just a few a table busy but we waited 1520 minutes just to ask Terrible
wonderful place great service and I would like to thank especially the waiter Joo friendly and super attentive
Great Irish coffee delicious homemade nachos with a scrumptious cheese sauce  super fresh flavourful chunky guacamole have to drop 3 stars for the AWFUL service Went inside  waited over ten minutes for the two ladies at the empty bar to even acknowledge us we eventually got an unbothered boa tarde tried ordering  were rudely told to sit outside We waited outside another ten minutes before having our order taken Then waited another 15 minutes for the food  drinks but it was worth the wait Tried to order a shot of Jameson  the lady acted like I requested her first born child she brought a Jameson  7up its a sin to mix Jameson lol  informed that they dont do shots Trying to pay was another ordeal we waited 15 minutes for our change my boyfriend had to go in to get it  they said they forgot Personally I think there are several better Irish pubs in Lisbon with far better service which is a shame because I loved the outdoor seating and views of this place
Nice place but not Irish No fish and chips shepards pie corned beef and cabbage pasties steak pies The only thing Irish is the name But they do have Guinness
My favourite kind of place Cool atmosphere good beer and the staff are great
Perfect bar with quality beers and bar snacks The ambiance also very nice I liked the place completely
Nice place fun and nice bar tenders  Got too loud for me when it was packed but I had a good time
The burger was ok the music was too loud at least for my taste for such a small pub Only one toilet
The George is a pleasant afternoon bar and a roaring evening sports bar We visited most afternoons over a three week stay in  Lisbon and got to know the bartenders and staff A  delightful group of youngsters anxious to chat Overall the service was good and the drinks well prepared We give it 4 clams on the coveted Five Quahog Rating Scale
Nice place went in looking for a quick bite to eat The menu I wouldnt recommend for any fussy eaters We got fish  chips which were so lovely the fish was nice and crispy Then we had chicken wings  sweet chilli sauce it was 650 or 750 and they were fairly small but good I tried black fish for the first time its very soft and the chorizo sauce was amazing The atmosphere was nice not too crowded However one of the toilets wouldnt close  the other had no lock so i had to go to the shopping centre next to it to use the bathrooms which was a bit frustrating
Fries are soggy and dry and as for the fish batter is too thick but at least is crispy chicken wings are dry and blended Service is nice
The food was fabulous It was a wonderful surprise to taste such beautiful and delicious cuisine with complex flavors like a ceviche prepared in a celery root bisque The drunken pear dessert creatively prepared with crushed walnuts is essential This place is Lisbons hidden gem
Came for lunch and was welcomed by a wonderful waitress with the eyes the cor of the sea She was very nice and attentive Inside the staff was nice while paying out as well Food was great for the price and the beers were nice and cold
Great terrace for having your coffee or a couple of beers Inside it is a traditional Portuguese cafe Unfortunately anywhere you turn there will be a TV in front of you making it hard to focus on human interactions If crowded you can expect an often very slow service
Very good local barresturant They usally show sports which is cool cause you can go there and watch your favorites
Its five star as you can watch all the football games here And other sports Reasonably priced and nice staff Decent food
Awful bar The most arrogant and unfriendly staff Ive ever seen anywhereparticularly the old bald barman Avoid
Nice atmosphere great seating options
Quite unwelcoming staff Rude for no reason
Friendly quiet and nice place Really close to the metro station wich helps after a few drinks The staff was really nice totally going to come back
Im not one to go into aBritish Bar while away on holiday in another country Stopped off here though because it was extremely hot and we had been walking around a lot so needed a rest  Fairly quiet while we were here Tried the Super Bock stout and the 1927 IPA both very nice Managed to connect to the free WiFi from the bakery down the road as well
I thoroughly enjoyed the space despite the service being slow to serve I admit that at first it was understandable as it was full however at the end of the night there were very few patrons at the bar but the service didnt get speedier at all Love the atmosphere despite how small it is but the prices and service should be improved
Just visited this bar and what a rip off Ordered 1 alcoholic free beer and what was supposed to be a large leffe beer got charged 10 euros  The large leffe was 33cl the same size as a can of coke Tourists avoid this bar otherwise you will get ripped off  there are a lot nicer bars and a lot cheaper 
Was here for the RWC 2023 Ireland South Africa game Food was limited to cheese and ham toasties and portions of chips I dont know if thats always all they have but what was served was fine Friendly bar staff and a good atmosphere Super Bock was 5 for half a liter
Incredible english pub Well received and well served We were greeted as if we were known Moreover the staff was friendly and allowed us to sing our own songs The ambient played music is both joyful and moving If you seek a calm bar to enjoy your evening either in a large group or between few friends go there
This isnt called wasp bar anymore nor is it a metal bar Its an english pub now  called english pub as well Might be good if u are into english pubs
Its a hard core Rock bar its small but with a massive personality It decoration is a rock mad teenager that decided to cover ever available space in rock memorabilia Not the expensive auction kind but the real life kind The barmaid is hardcore rocker We drank whiskey and sang over the great sounds playing You like to rock out and drink hit this place or be a geek
Heartbreaking google stated it was open Walked all the way there to look up and find the English pub It was very bland looking  just your old regular English pub Thank god for the Cave rock bar around the corner to Satisfy our needs
Very chill place with lots of beer choices Did not try the food Balcony seating is amazing Much bigger on the inside than I initially thought and restrooms are decent 1010 would recommend
Well what I can say Perfect Really I was a long time to find some beers like that Finally I can say that is a perfectly place to enjoy a beer So the food I have tried a burguer and for my surprise Its amazing too The staff is also friendly I must recommend this place
Great place to watch sport Service a little slow but good selection of beers and yummy beige food  This would definitely be a lively spot in the evenings and probably a better offering than some of the places in the vicinity posing as Irish pubs
We had an Octoberfest special with two salchichas a burger and 2 Delirium Reds All was very tasty but remember that Delirium Red is 98 and it feels like it  The visit was on Thursday which was a holiday in Portugal The place was halfempty with high was nice not that much noise and we got a table with no problem Ill def be back
If you are looking for a place to have a drink dance play table football darts or snooker this is the ideal place
Very expensive place terrible service and the food is bad it needs to improve a lot
The Wall Street Bar is located at the Sana Metropolitan Hotel Its a cozy bar with good service We placed our order which was quickly taken care of The Bar has several tables with armchairs but what draws attention are the extremely comfortable sofas
Relaxed comfortable and relaxing atmosphere Live piano music as ambient sound Equipped with various types of foodsnacks whose qualityprice ratio is good Food well served and friendly service
Got super drunk here for super cheap and met some drunk Irish chicks there Yaaay Liquor 
good bar for cheap cocktails one of the best pina colada ive ever had they made it with a bit of condensed milk
Great atmosphere with everyone stood on the streets its definitely an experience not to miss
Maybe the best cocktails in Bairro Alto Definitely the cheapest Very good Margarita Not a half point of crushed ice just a really good short cocktail
This place offers a great value for money especially considering it with other restaurants located at the city center The food is super tasty and the staff is very friendly The portions are very big and they have a lot of vegetarian options Unfortunately they only have a few tables so it might be better to book it in advance or to get there early to secure a spot We definitely recommend this restaurant
What a special place We had a great gazpacho and some mortadella focaccia great qualityprice ratio The owner is so sweet and the decoration feels like home 
We went there for drinks and meals last night Everything was excellent so much so were going back tonight Food was 100 excellent drinks were amazing They even accept BTC as payment
Nice chill vibe with an interesting bar deco Bartenders were friendly and warm Cocktails were ok good but not great and to rave about as per other reviews The cocktails were decently priced as well so nothing to complain there  I also had a slice of their apple cake which was delicious 
Tapas 45 euros without invoice bad hygiene in wc
Nice
Total tourist rip off We asked for tapas the waiter said he only had bread and cheese left We got a cheese sausage platter and had to pay 21 Underground
We had a great time the food and wines are beyond excellent The welcome is just great We came back the next day because it was so good They speak French  An obligatory passage Thanks to the whole team
Great little place for some good fun music and danceNice friendly staff and quick service We were going to Irish pubbut people having a great time in front derailed us and we didnt regret it
Fully a VIBE We passed by and the music made us dance in the street so we came in and its so fun and welcoming Well be back
Brilliant little bar right beside the Irish pub we were going into The loud salsa music blasting out caught our attention  especially Mary who loves dancing and within 30 seconds she was dancing with one of the staff Its a small intimate bar  but with a great drink selection  including cocktails The music is infectious and you cannot help yourself but dance A great party bar thoroughly recommended Marcos one of the barman was particularly good He used to live in Ireland and knew all our favourite pubs in Smithfield
Its a normal bar with a great environment Latin music and good service For drinks and dance is perfect The bar is small but the environment is pretty good If you want a place to talk the music here might be a bit too loud
We stopped in for a couple pints and really enjoyed it The bar has inside seating and rooftop patio with a great view of the city The staff are very friendly and the beer is well priced
I was introduced to this bar during a stop while on a walking tour  I didnt partake the first night because I was exhausted and didnt want to have a drink  However  my friend and I made it back here twice before leaving Portugal   Both times we visited this dive bar at night   It wasnt as busy as it seemed to be during the day   The only downside is that we never made it to the rooftop  The first time we ordered a Caprinha Black and it became our drink of choice at this bar  On the second visit  the drink was better than the first time   Id definitely recommend stopping by and having a drink and possibly a bite to eat  The vibes are great
Went here for late night drinks on a Wednesday  A little busy but it didnt take long to get served  Wife had a big glass of fantastic sangria and I had a beer 1150 total We sat on the rooftop and enjoyed the views and atmosphere  I wish we would have discovered this place sooner on our trip because we would gladly go back
Coldest and best beer in Lisbon Great relaxed environment Do yourself a favour and try it we did and came back daily on our trip
Crazy busy but excellent craft beer list and nice vibe for hanging out Loved the interior decor and overall mood Big screen for games
A wonderful craft brewery in Lisbon Very friendly and attentive staff Nice comfortable surroundings Good music playing too A very relaxing atmosphere to enjoy some suds We had the cheese board too which was great Keep up the great work
Cool hangout spot for beer and cider lovers Pub food and good salty snacks for drinking Lovely servers Go here for a chill evening  10 for a 5 beer flight Honestly pretty bummed I didnt try the piri piri chicken wings
Trendy craft bar selling a good selection of craft beers and open a lot earlier than a lot of the other craft bars in Lisbon  Nice open plan style place so nice to get out of the sun for a bit and sip a cold beer
Great place to take a beer listen music and relax enjoy the day and taste all food and beers great value and full recommended
Fantastic food  drinksthe mixed meat skewers were our favorite and the Gin  Tonic was the best that Ive ever had a great selection of beers and a comfortable atmosphere with chill music playing The owner takes pride in what he does and it shows Dont forget to bring cash as that is the only method of payment available We will definitely return on our next trip to Porto Well done Dont miss this stop
It was very nice time There is a very kind staff and very delicious food He also recommends the menu well
I have visited dozens and dozens of pubs in a lot of countries but this one is one of the best Believe me Very good food very good beer very good bartender and cook in one person If nothing else from Porto this place I will remember and if I ever come back to the town I will come here
Pretty chill experience the prices have gone up a bit in the last few years which is normal now The drink was well served
Amazing pub near the beach It has that Irish pub vibe with an attentive staff who makes you feel at home The food is top notch and theres a fantastic selection of beers Definitely worth a visit
Lovely time Really good vibes Peppers were so flavorful and the whisky sours were well balanced and delicious
A cozy bar near the beach open after midnight and always busy and crowded Prices are a bit high but the atmosphere is so nice It reminds me the movie the pirates of the Caribbean sea You may initiate some friendships there so enjoy the time you are there
This is it  Great place The service is perfect  friendly smiling people who are interested in customers  We wanted to watch the match and theres no problem in doing that  thanks They have my favourite Guinness and many other beer wine and whiskey I think everyone will find something for their taste The view is cool as they have a roof top places to admire it The food is also okay  And the prices are the same as in other places I can highly recommend it 
Nice Pub  The drinks were good and the staff is very kind  The only issue I had was with the toilet Very small and not clean
Very lovely place with kind and friendly stuff We got perfect drinks for fair price Thanks a lot guys Good luck
Awesome place to enjoy food and drink with a view of Porto city If you like Irish and English style pubs this a must Located by the river in Gaia you have a perfect view of the city across the river We spent a few hours just watching the boats on the river chilling with a Guinness and Mojito It was fairly quiet when we where there but I surmise that this place may be arockin on a Saturday night Which is also nice sometimes  Recommended 
Lovely friendly staff and lovely red ale beer Delighted too to have sampled  enjoyed greenwhite wine  But frightful pizza Hard to believe it could be so bad and even harder to believe it was baked at all as opposed to being just heated upslightly 
This restaurant doesnt serve excellent food but what we had was good enough The bacalhau a Braga was Nice and also the steak
The black vodka drink was awesome and the chorizo app was good The Portuguese steak was totally trash The service was also garbage
It was quiet but we were there outside traditional dinner time had a lovely meal food was delicious Would definitely return if when we go back to Porto
Interior design is perfect Beer choices are not bad but I was expecting more The food is ok they had few options to eat although they had a lot more in the menu I ordered chorizos when I started eating the waiter came and said now they have all the optionsSo it was too late
Attentive and friendly staff Fantastic cocktails Couldnt even say which one was the best
Went there at a very busy time The waiters were nice even in the rush and offered complimentary drinks for the hourlong delay with the food Its a great place if you just want to get drinks Loved the veal croque The ambience is cozy and the lighting is on spot
Went here to watch a Champions league game with friends and it was very pleasant Good atmosphere with Porto fans 100 safe place Also good beers and good and appetizers The staff is very nice
We went here with some friends to have some drinks and enjoy the sunset It had a nice vibe and a great view  The staff were friendly and all spoke great English  There was a good selection of drinks and cocktails  we had beer fresh raspberry lemonade and espresso martinis  and pretty good food It is NOT very coeliacfriendly as there was only one gluten free thing on the menu shrimp salad and it took a lot of asking to find out the allergen information In the end it was an ok salad The rest of the food was good quality though my friends enjoyed their ribs steak and fries  Id recommend it as a chilled place to have some drinks near the beach especially at sunset Not great for dietary requirements though
Perfect place to watch sunset  The beach club with dancing atmosphere The food is average Its more as beer or cocktail place
After a long day of biking alongside the beach coast this was like an oasis  We came here little bit after noon and there was no problem with seats They seated us promptly and they managed our order just as quickly  We went for White sangria and nachos Sangria was very good But sadly nachos was on the other side of a bridge  I cant talk about other food but from observing of other tables it was looking very tasty 
Beautiful view nice to stop by when going around Prices are average drinks are good services is okay It was a bit crowded around lunch time so we needed to wait for a while to be seated but it was worth it I enjoyed the seating area in the sand nice idea
Horrible Fisch soup for 12 was very bad without any taste Pommes was a disaster small sandwich for 11 very bad in taste We waited for drinks 15 minutes restaurant was empty Hands away from this hole
Terrible service They have kind of a competition for worst bar in the town Heritage could make it to the top
The location was great but the food experience was forgettable The waiter whose attitude wasnt great got our drinks wrong our food order wrong and the food itself was nothing like what we expected My cod salad was a cold bowl of chick peas swimming in oil and a few shreds of fish for 1450 The tuna fillet looked straight out of a tin Sorry not one to recommend
Terrible service We waited 20 minutes for someone to take our order  well nobody did The waiters were actually waiting for what that I dont know doing nothing
Return visit for my daughter First for me Lots of bars in this area and good prices 2 for a good sized beer Lots of outdoor seating Will be packed later on on Sao Jaoa festival BBQ smoking getting ready for sardines Ended up having more beers and growing odd head growths
very affordable and incredible atmosphere my friends and I returned multiple times during our stay in Porto 
Place is great Ambiance is perfect for night drinks But a great line to follow for drinks
Quick easy super affordable and so good We went 4 times in 2 days Try the white sangria
We booked a table for a rugby match and arrived late so understandably our table was given away but despite the full house we were still warmly welcomed and could watch the match in a friendly atmosphere
Trying to find a place to watch Rugby in Porto proved tough Luckily we looked this place up and was able to book a table to watch the Springboks Vs Irealand RWC game this is recommended as its not a pubclub that is simply open to the public for walk ins The atmosphere was great and everyone was very respectful not like your usual pub where things can get rowdy or messy Thanks for hosting a lovely game day event
A great find for us Was looking for somewhere to watch the RWC finals and took a chance at the rugby club Staff are super friendly and helpful Food is basic sports bar fodder but they are really nice hamburgers Large selection of beers   with a mix between the craft market and lager selections
Great pub to watch sports We went for rugby had a few drinks and a burger Everything was great from the ambiance to the home made burger Prices were very reasonable with a cheeseburger and fries selling for 8 or 9euros Highly recommended
Cocktails 5 
A pub with a good atmosphere and various types of drinks and tapas The service was excellent with a staff that makes you very comfortable We will return
Strong smell of food  Super slow and inefficient service despite being friendly  Absurd prices for the environment and quality
Great cocktails interesting decor Normal prices for the type of drinks Friendly service by the bartender We just highlight the intense cloud of tobacco in the air sometimes with children in the place and little ventilation
Great music top drinks super nice staff five stars 
A well decorated place Good for relaxing It has  smoker and non smoker zones A little bit pricier than usual but it is a good price for the way youre served
Always a pleasure spending someone with good friends at this pub Friendly staff We thoroughly enjoy the place Highly recommended
Good ambiente and good drink thanks for your welcome
A great pub Lovely atmosphere and vibe We had a great night meeting new friends The owner and bar staff were very friendly and we received a warm welcome I can see why this pub is becoming so popular
Joao is an absolute legend we came back to this bar for 5 nights in a row for his awesome energy He makes the best cocktails we have had in years 
Have to say this bar had a great atmosphere off the beaten track in Porto Good music nice vibes Unfortunately there was a mix up where they came at the end of the night  accused my friend of not paying for a round of drinks on card however I saw him pay cash They accepted this for a while but then asked us to leave Having managed nightclubs in England I can understand these mistakes can happen but I guess they were pretty convinced they were right  asked us to leave to their credit they were very polite about it  I do believe it was a genuine mistake but its a shame as otherwise was a brilliant bar  I think they just made a mistake
Outstanding bar with cool atmosphere bar staff very attentive and chatty a must once you are in this part of city
First time trying proper Portuguese food We ordered Francesinha Calamares Bolinhos Bacalhau and Chourio Assado The staff were helpful and very welcoming Price is also reasonable but some can be overpriced however its expected near the centre
I order a pizza for 10 euros  there was not tasty at all I women on my side  complain about a cold potatoes chips Try to pay with credit card but they not accept  I pay in cash
Fast service waiters with the right attitude The best salad I had so far in Porto Salada Portugesa
I happened on this place while strolling on the river walk They have enough purely vegetarian options for a decent meal The staff is extremely friendly and the food is good Its less pricey than everything in this area and enough vegetarian options  I would come back here again
Starved after our 6 hour train trip from albufierathis was the perfect spot  Didnt realize it was a pizza place  s being lactose i tolerant was going to leave  Buthungry The vegan cheese which I have never had but tried because the waiter said is good was great   The thin crust and the sauce is delicious     Perfect for a quick meal
Everything was great To really be perfect was just missing two things 1 smoking should not be allowed at the entrance of the door because all the cigarette smell goes inside In our case my wife was pregnant and Im not a smoker so we had to eat pizza and enjoy our time with smoke of other people the same goes for the terrace inside Point number 2 the music could be much better The loud rock music doesnt fit the place and environment elegant cocktails environment ask for a nice jazzy soul music which invites you to keep drinking and dont want to go home Maybe a bit of an upbeat funky music or some old classic rock could work but not heavy rock or metal Otherwise pizza and drinks were very good Keep it up and wishing you could improve on these two points 
The hubs and I decided to walk by one afternoon just to see what it looked like We were pleasantly surprised to find they open at noon so of course we had to stop in for a cocktail I had El Mario and the hubs had the Anne Bonney Both were not only beautiful but absolutely delicious The vibe during the day anyway is very cozy with a nice outdoor garden and a little quiet space above the main bar We will definitely be back We didnt try the pizza but we will the next time we visit  it looked and smelled delicious
Came here on the basis of a google search and left completely satisfied I picked a time of day that wasnt busy at all and Im glad Perfectly executed cocktails an El Mario and a Tripitaka Highly recommended and cant wait to come call again
LOVED IT the whole vibe was AMAZING it was my first time  for carnaval  and will def return people very chilled good vibes music a bit strange  dj changed the style quite often but overall WOW Will def come back
Great outdoor area in those summer nights Wednesdays are capirinha nights for just 3 Nice music with a nice staff Calm ambiance Great for a get together with a group of friends
pleasant environment excellent to relax with friends
Really disappointed as they overcharged me Not about the money about the misleading information given upon the order Otherwise not too bad place for a night out
Great little place with a wonderful beer selection Our apartment was just down the street so we stopped by here several times while in Porto Very friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere Besides a good selection of beers on tap there is also a large number of bottled beers to choose from If you enjoy good craft beers make sure you stop by here next time you are in Porto
I went there to try some beer from Portugal  I started with a Good Old Days from Fermatage a dark beer with only about 35 alcohol The taste was ok but I felt that it was too flat  After that I could not really connect with the bartenders so I decided to move on
Nice little craft beer bar this 10 taps of quality craft beer good range of sour lager weiss stout etc Lots of different countries too And loads of cans in the fridge too Comfy seating The decor is a bit rough and ready but its nice and theres a small outdoor patio too Staff are super nice Lovely place
We just came for drinks It has a layback vibe with a good tap list I enjoyed my stout The barman was very welcoming
Commenting on the outdoor bar A little less impressive than I would expect for a hotel rooftop catering to a mediumhigh public The view is short of any Douro river sight and you can only guess the sea is in the horizon The decor and sound are uncreative accounting for a bland atmosphere You can pick your drink from a reasonably extensive list without any eye catching option and there arent many food choices and no ice cream to my amazement All in all its a quiet place without any ruckus or crowding which may be a good thing for some but there is nothing that can make this rooftop experience into a lasting memory
Some of the worst customer service ever While the view and the food were good the entire experience was ruined by the nonexistent wait staff Even though the resturant and patio were near empty we constantly had to track down the waiters and remind them repeatedly about out orders Dont bother go to another rooftop
Awesome place Not really a point of interest for tourists Perfect for a first date during summer Never crowded during regular week days
A very nice view and great place to relax and watch the city go by
Good place Not bad burgers nachos with tasty souse and Guinness
Irish man in Irish bar drinking Irish beer left bitterly disappointed Sunday night dead was only customer and no chat with bar man who was more interested in hiding out the back Tut Tut Guinness was just about ok
Great place in the centre for all your sport Best thing I experienced was the very friendly staff who seem to always smile and put up my poor attempt at polish The best  pub in Warsaw  Cheers
Irish and living in Warsaw Ive tried many of the fancy and trendy places in town but I always come back to this place for the authentic vibe great draft beer nice bar food and good value Staff and customers super friendly  If your visiting pop in for a quick pint Highly recommend the cytrynowka shot  homemad fresh lemon squeezed lemon  juice with vodka served ice cold from the freezer Best cyrtynowka in town
I visited this bar an hour before closing and ordered some amazing cocktails with a couple of friends We sat right by the bar and the bartender was really nice to talk to and made us really good drinks  She even made a custom drink that tasted amazing The atmosphere was really good We didnt visit the upstairs but I think that would also be something to try We didnt order any food neither but the drinks and staff both were great
Very beautiful interior inside They have also sits outside during summertime Prices rather high but this is heart of Warsaw
Irish bar for some reason playing very loud heavy metal music bar upstairs also largely for watching sports As far as I could  see the only thing Irish about the place was the name Stayed for one drink wouldnt go back
Shocking prices  10 for two halves of Guinness The barman laughed at me AFTER Id ordered and quipped that its just 5Z extra 1 for a full pint After I asked him why didnt he inform me of this before I paid and can I now pay the other 5Z for the rest of the pint he got nasty and shouted that hes already completed the transaction THEN his misdemeanor towards me became even worse
Curtis the owner was amazing he went above and beyond to make sure that I was able to watch a LaLiga While other more popular games were going on at that time I really appreciate the customer service Also the drinks were fairly priced
The staff at Shamrock are truly the heart of the place Their genuine smiles and attentive service add to the welcoming atmosphere They have a knack for making each guest feel special whether youre a regular or a firsttime visitor
No cleared empty bar Good music but this is only one plus Paid 42 z for one Baby Guinness the barman previously announced a 30z price When I asked again why I paid 42 he told me that the price is 42 z  Also they didnt give me receipts which is highly forbidden by Polish law Soap in WC is missing as well as lock for the door
Shamrock Pub A Rollicking Good Time   If youre in search of an authentic Irish experience filled with laughter music and plenty of pints then look no further than Shamrock Pub This lively establishment boasts all the charm and character youd expect from a traditional Irish watering hole with a few quirks that only add to its appeal  From the moment you step through the door the sticky floor seems to grab hold of your shoes like a longlost friend making it clear that this is a place where folks come to let loose and enjoy themselves The friendly atmosphere is infectious and it wont be long before you find yourself raising a glass with the regulars  The pints at Shamrock Pub flow as freely as the River Liffey and youll find a wide array of beers on tap to quench your thirst While the food choices may not rival those of a fine dining establishment the nofrills menu adds to the downtoearth vibe of the place Dishes like Whatevers Left in the Fridge  will make you feel right at home  But what truly sets Shamrock Pub apart is the live music Arrive after 11 pm and youll be treated to a veritable feast for the ears as talented musicians take to the stage and fill the air with the sweet sounds of various tunes The energy in the room is palpable and its not uncommon to see patrons dancing and singing along with the performers  In short Shamrock Pub is the perfect destination for those seeking a night of genuine Irish craic and ceol While it may not be the most polished venue in town its rougharoundtheedges charm is what makes it truly special Whether youre a local or just passing through be sure to stop by for a pint and a song  you wont be disappointed Slinte 
This place was ok The service was good but the food was mediocre I had the fish  chips and the fish was OK but the fries were not good I like the Grimberger beer on tap but I doubt I will return Theres so many places to eat in that area
Terrible terrible Guinness in this place I ordered two pints and both bartenders didnt pour the Guinness correctly As you can see there is bubbles all over the inside of the glass indicating the glasses are not clean  its likely these glasses were washed with other food plates  utensils which is why you can see the bubbles  Guinness not lacing to the side of the glass as you drink it Two disappointing pints Glass cleaning and staff training on pouring need attention
Nice spot to have a good drink and watch a good game Toilets could be better though In general I loved the place
Cant recommend the pub We were ignored by the staff When we wanted someone to come to our table we were told we have to order by the bar because they dont our table is too far Lowest level of customer service I ever experienced when servers dont even care enough to take an order If you are looking for the worst place in Warsaw  thats the place
To notch lively craft ale pub pints about 188 great jukebox and good vibes
In Side is a pub located at Nowy wiat 27A in Warsaw Every day it draws many people who are looking for a fun night out and know how to actually find this place  The location is quite unique Situated in an old and partially abandoned building to get there you need to pass a dark corridor filled with graffitis and trash Even though it may sound sketchy I personally quite enjoyed this urbanist style  The beer is very cheap Probably the cheapest you can get in the city center There are just a few varietes of beer served from the tap and its possible to add some sweet syrup for a small fee However you still get a choice of many other bottled drinks  The jukebox is a nice addition For a small price you can set up your own preferred music with karaoke which makes for a great entertainment for the night especially if you come there with a large group of friends  The toilet are not in the best condition Only one is open it is usually dirty and often without a functioning lock  In conclusion Id recommend this pub for anyone looking for a fun night out without spending too much money The location is pretty interesting as well and the addition of the jukebox adds up to a quite unique experience in its own right
Certainly one of those cool drinking places for students
Cool alternative pub with the cheapest beers in Warsaw
Really fun and friendly pub that shows all the top football games Their pirogies were very good too
Nice pub with London atmosphere Good beer and sausages
Great venue The closest youll get to a traditional English pub in Poland Owner is always available and active in ensuring people have a good time Food is brilliant too
I remember this place many years ago Now No atmosphere  very poor service  not too friendly either The waitress we had spent more time on her phone than the customers  all four
Now  if you are looking for a place to quitely drink your cheap beer then this place is for you  Half liter for 8zl probably one of the best deals you can get outside happy hours Its a very traditional bar no fuss Perfect location people here are usually middle age and in the nights they can be quite drunk  but its a real Polish experience 
Fabulous local bar Lovely staff 
One of its kind original vintage Polish bar Not another stylized copy or a network but a place ruled by same person for over 30 years Homemade food vodka and the owner lady makes the magic Dont let it fade away and visit with friends
Cosy Loved their local cytrusvodka Great view on always busy nowy wiat boulvar Also quite tasty was local polish drinking snack  Tatar
Polish friend did not kid around when describing this place as a comfy place with a bit of a character  4 taps so quickly explored yet you want to stay just for the ambience Has a bit of hidden gem feel to it
Tiny cozy place Craft beer really good Pork tamahowk was good Thanks for evening
Great food great beer great vibe 
This is probably the best bar in Warsaw They have maybe 4 or 5 craft beers on tap and also more cans and bottles I had a pastrami sandwich which was excellent The owner was happy to chat and tell me about the place The decor is really cool and gives the place a nice atmosphere A hidden gem  This is not your typical Warsaw bar Recommend 100
Cool bar and interior Design Payed 40 for 2 Beers they also have a little Beer Garden outside
Probably the best pierogies Ive ever had Handmade and so delicious Drinks are good too and atmosphere is chilled out
I think this place comes alive only at night because I went there midday and it was almost dead Ordered pierogi and they were strictly okay There was only one person manning the entire place and service was quite slow
Quirky place with good craft beers and honestly some of the best Pierogi I ever tried in Poland Stands out from other places so I recommend it highly Smokers lounge in the back is a plus Lots of expats and locals alike Do visit
A large group of us went here twice on our weekend in Warsaw in June 23 On the Friday we went in the basement  very atmospheric good music decent drinks On the Saturday watched the Euro final upstairs  brilliant value for money
Love at first sight A lovely combo of local charm and Italian hospitality thanks to the bartenderwaiterowner A cosy and warm place with good food that you just  wish to return to over and over again
Great Karaoke Bar Drinks are very reasonable staff very friendly and atmosphere was electric
Happened upon this bar while walking around Old Town Met a ton of incredible people at their amazing karaoke night Literally ended up staying till close Come here if youre looking for a great night out in Warsaw
Great atmosphere beside alcohol drinks theres also coffee apple  orange juiceabout food last time Ive been there there was only chips and peanuts it would be better to make reservation earlier as you probably wouldnt find a seat if you came lastminute i can say there are approximately not more than 30 place including the seats next the barman one more thing you need to be aware this place accepts only cash payment
Great place Live broadcasts Good beer Friendly atmosphere
The place has its own atmosphere I was a stranger and I think I didnt get into the atmosphere a bit because its a typical place for regulars Little space cramped and quite a narrow range of alcohols In general I recommend coming to drink on an ordinary beer day If something happens like a match etc I advise against it
A bit of a murderous atmosphere Probably only for local Legia fans You can drink beer but there is no food Payment only in cash Only two tables outside not much space inside Nice owner
An embarrassing breakfast Not worth any money  First of all coffee is BAD The coffee was burned  i didnt touch it  Second of all the food is also embarrassing I ordered a bagel with guacamole and what came was a not fresh bagel with a small portion of avocado without any addition so it was not a guacamole And the salad is just a bunch of lettuce with one cherry tomato  And also my husband got a soft egg which could only be described as a hard egg Not to mention they gave him a fork to eat that  Had to give him the spoon from the cofee to eat that
Really great pizza and tagliatelle with a 2 for 1 cocktail offer every day Unfortunately we were not given an English menu but they have one online
I love this place Ive been here a few times during my time in Warsaw for breakfast and dinner and never disappointed They have a lot of vegetarian options all very tasty and perfectly cooked and the staff are just lovely and very attentive Its also open 24 hours which is mind blowing  I will be definitely going back on my next trip to the city
Amazing place with a big variety of drinks  and food  Two floors so it is spacious and interior design its modern and music suits that place a lot We dine here after 11pm and place is very vibrant and busy The waiter was very nice and really helpful Really worth it to go especially with family and friends For sure Ill come back here for more good stuff 
Amazing pub good vibe nice drinks with decent prices The staff is amazing and proffesional except the DJ since he plays only his favorite songs and sings every time while the customers want to do that But all in all amazing
Nice thematic place a little bit longer wait today like 25min waiting for herring and it wasnt like all of the people was ordering food Now good things Shots are very good prices on the lower spectrum for city center also it looks controversial and stylish You have to order on bar so its probably a good idea to sit on bar like lots of people does After all place is nice for a pub tour or something like that
Nice that they are doing karaoke but the guy organising it is just not respecting the orders of the songs sings his song every 2min as if it was his only and one moment in his whole life Sharing the mic with his friends only Staying 2h and still no song
The dj threw ice at me this is unacceptable What a shame on Poland bar in the most touristic street in Warsaw is run by such rude staff Id never witnessed anything close to this before
Recently visited this place myself and it has left a great impression on me The menu has a good variety of food and wont leave you hungry Meals are very impressive on taste and the hot wine is the best seasonal drink for now The most important thing that I have to mention is the working crew everyone is very nice and positive I had a good time definitely 5 stars and a great perspective for growing
Food are great personal and atmosphere are perfect And count of people in Index confirms that the institution is good we will be back for sure 
Food I ordered the roso soup and chicken with mushrooms and mashed potatoes  The soup looked decent but tasted just tasted as if it was made with one single bouillon cube the croutons on the side was good  The main dish was what disappointed me I ordered chicken with mushroom sauce and mashed potatoes One would think the mashed potatoes would be a side but I was served the smallest amount of chicken with more mushroom sauce than meat on a bed of mashed potatoes I liked the mushroom sauce but the dish itself was relatively small and I felt like the plates main character was mashed potatoes not chicken  The atmosphere was a bit shady the reason was probably the karaokestage side since it was inactive there were no lights in that corner while I was sitting couple tables away and besides me there was only a couple I liked how subtle washroom entrance is but there was a strange smell coming from it
Horrible experience 34 degrees really hot day and we had to ask three times to turn on the air conditioning We were a group of seven people ready to have lunch and drink a lot We had a drink and ran away  They are not attentive at all and there was nobody else in the bar
As an American  I wanted to try this place out   Fur those who know Applebees or Chilis  this place is similar   Great wooden accents with modern touches   The menu has a great selection   We were there during happy hour  so my husband and I enjoyed a few special priced cocktails   The food arrived quick and everything tasted great We both got hamburgers and they were in the larger side  we had to take the rest home   So if you are visiting from the US  this place will give you a touch of home
Delicious food and wine they serve your wines in Riedel glasses They do serve some Americanlike dishes as well as a standard selection The cocktail menu seems to be extensive as well catered to everyones taste The service is admirable
Great ambiance  Warm service  Delicious food  The ambiance is perfect They have screens inside and if you are a sports fan  It is a great place to watch the sport  The staff is polite  Their classic lunch menu has huge portions which include a soup and a main course We ordered 2 lunch menus  Tomato soup and Spinach Pasta  French onion soup and Chicken tacos The thick and creamy tomato soup with crispy bread was such bliss The french onion soup served with bread dipped and topped with cheese was very tasty Chicken tacos and Pasta on the lunch menu have huge portions and were delicious The serving presentation is impressive too It was a perfect lunch couldnt ask for anything better  Found it one of the best places for the lunch menu which is absolute value for money HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
As a fellow American I had to put this place to the test it passed From the ambiance to the service and the food its great I would recommend any of the burgers for anyone looking to have an American burger while in Warsaw
An excellent craft beer pub Some of the reviews may be a little confusing because its run as a joint venture with the place across the road  We visited twice and had a great experience Great beer and a welcoming atmosphere  Also excellent staff who understand both the beer and peoplefocussed sides of the job  and seem to enjoy them  The only negative is that the single toilet should be better The very small WC has a translucent door while theres a sliding door to the sink area which doesnt lock so its not the most comfortable feel  Still highly recommended as a modern craft beer place that anyone should feel comfortable in
Enjoy a Beer under the Dragon They also offer Pizza and Burger Good Stop for a drink on a long sightseeing day
Yes to all Even if the food is not top notch everything else is Beer selection look at the fridge and the other fridge with barrel aged dark stuff  The service is super friendly Music is not cliche and very interesting  Love it
If you are a beer fan then this a place to visit in the old town of Warsaw A very wide selection of different types of beer  The taste is great and unusual you will definitely find something you like  Price is also good enough space for friends and company  The atmosphere inside is very friendly and welcoming  I would love to come back some time in the future Definitely worth the visit
Pizza and karkwka both good but service very variable Check your beer to make sure you get full measure Some staff nice others rude
They try to scam you on the number of drinks you have had so always make sure you check the bill before paying I am disappointed as I used to come here for years and at first I thought it was an honest mistake at their end Its not
A very nice surprise Napolitanlevel pizza and quick and efficient service I do recommend
Normal pub in a great location Perfect for people watching What distinguish it from other pubs is the neapolitan pizza easily one of the best pizza in town by the sheer fact it is made with the original recipe as in Naples If we compare it to the pizzerias back in Italy it is very average I suspect they dont keep the oven hot enough and pizza remains partly uncooked If youre expecting a Polish or American pizza look elsewhere
Very hospitable They accommodate a large group of 10 in a cozy private area perfect for a group setting Loved the setting wine was great and food was awesome The main duck meal was a bit dry but otherwise everything was spot on
Amazing polish food and service Nice staff they are so friendly their food is amazing I had the best tomato soup ever And I had dumplings stuffed with mushrooms and sour cabbage it was so delicious and tasty
Excellent eatery Great duck Perfectly cooked Great beers Hidden gem Amazing Friendly service Make sure you have a spot outside Inside is nice as well but the music is a bit loud Outside is absolutely lovely
A gem in a tourist area Beautifully balanced tastes in the beef tartar Both duck dishes were delicious Nice atmosphere and the owner clearly takes pride in his work and enjoys what he does Highly recommend
Great atmosphere and very good prices for drinks
Edit  this review was in error intended for an Irish bar in city Centre Although in response to the responder of this review  it would seem you have a chip on both shoulders  Take a pint and relax yourself  Certainly no issue with Irish owned bars doing well and I also have 5 star reviews  But I will leave 3 stars anyway for effort it takes for the angry reply All the best X
Absolutely great atmosphere especially during the RWC23 final Just a shame that there isnt always enough space for everyone Really worth having a pint and a snack during a visit in Krakw
A very nice Irish pub with Guinness live music and sports One my favorite bars in town very friendly staff and opportunity to get food from nearby food truck area
Popular loud pub food is pub grub nothing special but fine Staff are efficient but keep asking if you want another drink before you have even had chance to enjoy the current one Good place to watch the football
Great craic Great service  Great Guinness OK karaoke Good night out but a bit pricey when you enjoy 16pints of Guinness n your daughter like the same 
The staff food atmosphere is brill we returned the following day the bacon sandwich and pizza were delicious cocktails are fab The staff are so friendly chatty plenty tvs is your looking to watch a game
True irish pub Great Fish  chips great burgers
An Irish pub in the Maly Rynek They show sports games There are Guinness and Murphys Guinness tasted somewhat strange but it was acceptable I sat at the bar and asked to pay asap which was weird though
This is a typical Britishstyle pub that appears to cater mostly to the expat and English tourist crowd as well as the stagnight scene Decorated in the English pub style ie wood paneling and dark wallpaper There is lots of room inside and quite a few tables outside You can watch an FA match here as well as cricket and rugby along with other sports There is a kitchen serving up the usual suspects of pub grub fish and chips bangers and mash English fry up hamburgers and an assortment of other deep fried foods The food is hitormiss the staff is fairly unfriendly and often acts as if they were doing you a favor for serving you There are better English style pubs in Krakow
Lovely atmosphere here Drinks are fabulous especially the strawberry and passion fruit daiquiris Not that expensive which is a plus And all the staff are so welcoming They have karaoke most nights which is a good time too Definitely go visit while your here
I was disappointed that service charge was added on to our bill when there was no mention of service charge beforehand This is unfair trading practice  Prices are relatively expensive for Krakow  From what I experienced theres a lot of people celebrating stagdos here  On the plus side they do have many large TVs to watch sports matches on
Very cool pub  Even though the climate is to be marine in Krakow it actually works The atmosphere and the people are very nice and the menu of drinks and snacks varied The only thing is that the tables are close together but thats a thing in all pubs  Busy but not extremely crowded Found a table on Friday at 8 pm Relaxed atmosphere to a point where a dog came in with party and no one minded Thats a definite plus for me
We found this place on the way back home and were surprised to find a decent variety of craft beers The interior is well decorated and has good amount of tables both inside and outside
Stumbled upon this quirky nautical bunker Good beers enough rums to sink a tanker and singalong ditties to keep you merry
Cozy nautical themed bar  Decent enough service and good beer except for the Murphys on tap Awful and undrinkable But I should have known better to order it in a Polish pub Best to stick to the local beer
Thats a nice pub They have some remake of IPA from 2000th called Dog in the fog Good place to get one or a couple of drinks
Nice atmosphere Note that you should order at the bar at the entrance and then take your seat Food was good drinks as well Nice place to go to after work Guys do serve napkins with the food please
Food was spectacular beer was great service was excellent and the staff were friendly Honestly all of the bad reviews are from people with no sense of humor that take themselves too seriously The staff like to joke around here which is how I think any good pub should be Will definitely return
The food was simply amazing Traditional Polish cuisine at its best The portions are immense The staff are very polite and welcoming and interactive The Krakowstyle stew was the star of the evening Best of all the price is very reasonable  Regards and recommendations from Serbia
Had the English Breakfast Would liked the eggs to be runny Overall a nice breakfast but has gotten smaller since I last visited last year Friendly staff and prompt service
Popped in here several times at different times of the daynight had morning coffees and breakfast To the evening listening to great singers relaxing with a bottle of vino Great atmosphere and very friendly staff
Came here originally to drink and then they recommended burgers Terribly over cooked Music was top loud
The food was okay but was quite disappointed with the staff We had to wait for quite some time before someone came to us No menu on the table and the atmosphere in the pub was quite off Not friendly and every staff was rushing around  Not professional at all
What a fantastic pub staff second to none 5 nights almost same seat no problem at all Would like to know what you call the hotelapartment before you go downstairs
I ordered burger and fries 1 Unfortunately the burger was really tasteless 2 Didnt get my fries There was a big order on a different table so the staff brought every order together and apparently gave the fries to someone else even though Ive asked them about my order they said that its not yet prepared In a few minutes they brought the burger but not the fries and I was under impression that they are still not prepared In 30 minutes I approached the staff and they informed my that all ordered fries were already given Even though its not my fault that the staff has mismanaged the orders they kinda made the impressions that its the clients fault that I did not inquire with other customers if they took my fries even though Ive asked about my order After all The staff did not want to prepare a new order for me Highly disappointed in a poor order distribution system and on the fact that the staff didnt want to compensate for something thats clearly not the clients fault  Also the AC was blowing cold like crazy You can maybe put in a mode where it just blows on the ceiling only
Football Football  Mainly from England So this is your go to place to watch Football From England  And elsewhere  Around  1300 Polish zloty 260 295 euro for a large  And always better when your team wins as mine did  One word of caution  the Bar is a Cellar Bar so steps down into the Bar and also up steps to the Toilets
There is not great selection of beer and some positions are overpriced Also there are no food at all but you can order or bring whatever you want Atmospheres is the best that this pub have
Service 1010 Shots 810 Pierogi 210  Amazing place for daydrinking
Great place to have many kind of drinks in a relaxed atmosphere for gear price
Very cheap and good I recommend this place
Good and cheap alcohol sadly there were no cocktails but you can make one with just ordering a shot and add put it in sprite i reccomend the apple shots with sprite they have cheap 15l beer too this was the most affordable alcohol i ever drank i paid less than 150 for a shot of alcohol
Calm atmosphere soothing vibes and beautiful interior It is possible to bring your pet here but do confirm with the staff beforehand
a travel to the past nostalgic
Cracking boozer
Time stopped in this place and thats good  I played truant there in high school I went there during my studies I stood behind the bar for a while and returning to the same place after many years was soothing Although everything is in perfect order here  delicious cold beer as always cruelly disgusting wine  as always darts dancing around the tables  everything is there Even if I didnt want to I would still come back D
Small and cosy and a lot to look at as a football fan  also friendly staff and very cheap beer  7 zloty which is less than 2 euro for a pint I wonder what its like beeing there during the world cup the whole place outside was full with people in jerseys
Nice beer great for the Ireland match in June with the outdoor area beside it  Cheap too
Amazing bar Well worth the visit Lovely owner great beer 10 out of 10
Love this place super friendly and funny little bar
Great place wit friendly atmosphere to stay with friends or colleagues
Bar with welcoming and nice atmosphere for a drink or more At city center with nice music and welcoming atmosphere Totally recommend it 
love this place comfy warm even has fireplace can order pizza from Presto wide variety of  and nice staff Every Wed they host Pub Quiz but keep in mind to book table before comming in
Friendly bar man friendly locals great choice of beers atmospheric interior and of course Royal Family plates  love this place
Great atmosphere and friendly staff with very well priced and tasty cocktails on the menu
Beautiful place  service amazing cocktails love it
Mariusz is a great bartender very energetic polite and good vibe Nice evening
even if their are little people y have to ask fir drink by yourself nobody is coming to serve y a security is cimming telling y y have to order something typical poland rude no style no culture barbares as guest y are just a pieuce of coin if y want to drink a monte white wine they dont know what it is why not replace service stuff with robots
This is great Been there recently with my GF for some cheese toast not only was the food great but the staff is very friendly and helpful too
I really like this place They have tasty food cakes and all types of beer
Very tasty  cakes as for such a small place Place  deliver current points for pc users
Cozy and friendly environment I really love their breakfast choices
Amazing place with tasteful beers Best place to enjoy beers in relax
Quiet Sunday evening need customers I arrive the brown haired bartender is polite the blonde haired bartender however looks at me like a piece of garbage No pleasantries I am English but approached the transaction in Polish no attitude just a guy politely asking for a beer If thats your attitude you need another job
Good choice of draft beers They change periodically and usually have some for every taste
Funky and unusual beer Nice service
I had a good time over there The owner is a genuine person Overall it was an experience worth having
M3 Pub feels like home People from India with nice and warm hospitality
Great service and good atmosphere I fully recommended it
Nice Pub interesting place too go in Lodz
Its a pretty nice place  The sauces are as delicious as the pizzas  If you happen to drop by definitely stop by you wont regret it
Amazing experience at this pizza pub the owners are super friendly and the food is tasty
Tasty fast and cheap food Perfect place
Nice place and also good for vegan food
The worse ever burger Only bread and and meet
The ambiance of this place is attractive but that is it We ordered 2 items Ice tea and an appitizer of chicken The iced tea took 30 mins to come and the chicken never came after 1 hour I paid and said thank you Then they said the chicken would be out in 2 mins I declined and left then I realized they still charged me for the chicken which never came to our table Terrible Avoid
The food here was horrible The tempura shrimp were tiny and were served cold The noodle salad on which they were served seemed like a concoctuon of leftover tagliatelle with the leftover pieces of ginger from someones sushi and an entire bottle of a very strong storebought condimentlike sauce  I also had a chicken bucket which was simply horrendous The chicken tasted like it was cooked frozen and then reheated It was way overcooked and had a floury texture The batter lacked any flavour and had gone all soggy at the bottom  My wifes tomato soup was the the best thing we ordered The soup itself was tasty but at the bottom sat a mass of mozzarella that hadnt melted and could easily be a choking hazard  Service was friendly and drinks were good Hence the 2 stars
We have eaten breakfast There and recommendations it to everyone it was excellent Different menus We had Scandinavian Mens breakfast and sweet crepes for three person Very tasty Good prices One cafe is without a charge The service is really good
Amazing placeThe best Mad Dogs around Must seen
Ok
Nice coffee
Delicious food great service  I recommend it
Great little cosy coffee place Espresso was perfect and went very well with the cheesecake yummy Will be back for a longer break with bigger coffee and surely another dessert
Great place to sit down and have a coffee Im here pretty much every day They have quite great selection of drinks including alcohol and wine A few times my evening tea sessions turned into a good drinking festivities
Delicious desserts and coffeeunfortunately small portions It is not a place for every day consumption prices are higher that average
A nice and friendly place for drinking coffee meeting with friends looking at the people in lively piotrkowska I preferred to sit there for working with my laptop Although midaged women groups prefer here mostly a midaged male digital nomad may also enjoy the atmosphere at least for looking at stylish women while working If anyone can find a big americano for 14 zlotys and an actually functioning electricity plug in piotrkowska she should feel happier
Cosy place standard beers on tap Some craft beers in the bottles but nothing special Lots of other alcohol as well of course The place is cosy bartenders are ok Theres a mezzanine if you like it but I prefer to sit at the bar
Love a Scottish pub on foreign soil it is actually a mish mash of Scottish and Irish Id say but we were made to feel most welcome on the 3 occasions we visited we were only in Wroclaw for 3 nights but it was on our way back to the hotel local vodka and Coke 10 zloty jd and Coke 17 zloty Generous measures and friendly service Whats not to love Its a bit of a sports bar as well volleyball was playing every night on the big screen
Nice Pub with very good craft beers The bar is roomy an upper story on the top half friendly staff and an Irish Pub feeling that you forget youre in Poland Best AIPA in town
Good pub nice staff and Guinness on tap remember when it opened
This is an excellent bar inside and out day or night Good night time atmosphere in the bar but the seated area taking in the square is worth the wait if its full
Great place always busy even on a Monday night enjoyable atmosphere and very decent prices
Great place to meet your friends Always good atmosphere cheap and tasty food good drinks I guess I should have received their discount by now considering how many times I visited this place
The worst experience ever Not knowing English but with the command written in a piece of paper my father wanted to have a coffee however was poorly treated and kicked out of the bar Awful service will not come back for sure
Great pub good cheap beer Cheapest Guinness Love it
Great place with good prices and friendly atmosphere It offers some draught beers and a range of bottled ones as well as shots and whisky And when youre bored you can always borrow a board game
Cosy friendly bar just a few minutes walk from the market square though its easy to miss  just look for the Litovel sign Theres an AngloIrish feel to the place If you look carefully you can see it has a naval theme Pod Kilem means Under the Keel There is a small room at the back with free table football It has Irish music evenings from time to time The friendly bar staff serve Guinness on the rare occasions they can get it delivered Litovel beer currently just 10 zoty for half a litre Cocktails decently priced though dont expect an umbrella and a cherry On regular evenings music usually plays over the speakers and can make conversation a little difficult although they will turn it down if you ask Dogs are welcome Overall a great place for a drink in town
Drinks are cheap bartender is fun to talk to Music mostly rock and metal quiet enough to talk to people
To eat good quality steaks certainly recommend to visit here All menus ordered were so yummy and nice visually Especially mushroom soup had special taste General atmosphere inside was quite nice with football screen
We were waiting for an order for more than 1 hour Also in menu there was no rukola in burgers In reality they didnt put a salad but there was A LOT of rukola Also no caramelized onion Well the food didnt match a menu at all And it wasnt tasty Disappointed
The best burgers and steaks in Wroclaw And actually the best steak Ive ever eat Our favourite place Highly recommended 100100 Value for price
Wonderful staff  Service  So pleased we found this little gem Apologies for being a little drunk 
All employees were so kind to describe menu in detail Atmosphere is typical local pub with music and conversions by people In case of foods foods and price were great except for fried potatoes
One of my favorite place in the town 8 different beers on offer change every time Their coctails are also good Definetely one of the best places for groups
Amazing spot for craft beer cocktails and good eats Visited twice while passing through town and it was great The buffalo wings pulled pork sandwich and ribs are all tasty Beer selection changes daily and can always find something nice to drink
Excellent beer selection Im in love with that habanero chocolate pastry stout  First ever beef tatar was nice too 
Im an IrishScottish resident of Wroclaw and have long missed the presence of a bar that serves reliable Guinness and also has a good whisky collection Well finally its here  The Guinness is consistently excellent the whisky selection is truly world class and the staff are knowledgeable and extremely friendly  Theres also something here to fit every budget If whisky is something new to you theres no need to be shy as the staff are happy to advise and also offer introductory tasting sets  Also excellent bourbon cocktails are available Superlative my full recommendation
Awesome bar with ideal delicious cocktails that made just perfectly Definitely worth to visit and try few drinks Bartenders really knows what they are doing
Worth visiting 

After delivering many times Pizza Pub decided to decrease quality and sent me pizza which was not fresh at all The smell was really bad Manager decided do not do anything with that Would not recommend this pizza pub UPD I do like blue  cheese and issue was with meat that exactly was stated to Pizza Pub
Super cool place stays open till bright morning you can dance have a laugh or just get drunk    song has become anthem of last night Only downside is small choice of craft beers but other than that I cant complain Oh and bartender was cool af
Very very tasty pizza in Wrocaw We will order once again soon because we really enjoyed it You have to try their pizzas
A great little spot to find a collection of hidden places to eat and drink The pizza place has the most eclectic aray of things Very random but strangely addictive to poke and prod Pizza will take while as its fresh but worth the wait Favourite was the spicy chicken Joice of beers
I had a vegetarian breakfast here  Tofu Salad Toasts and it was delicious Perfectly crispy toasted bread and fresh salad It was made by Chef Krystyna Vinaigreat 
Nice bar with its own vibeGreat spot for people watching suggest you enjoy the beer rather than the food
Very nice classy restaurant with good meals friendly service and typical polish food Recommendation
Food was awful was gonna say the worst Polish food Id ever been served but the restaurant next door to this was even worse Very low quality produce saw lots of food being wasted by customers due to low standard Description of my meal was misleading I was expecting some sort of steak or cutlet said Beefpork but when arrived it was a shaped burger and my wifes sausage was like dry oats Service was slow as they looked a bit understaffed Saturday afternoon but place was not busy and all waitresses looked rushed off their feet Prices not too bad  but you get what you pay for Not sure what it is about Wroclaw square never had a decent Polish meal in the  square itself nice indipendant Pizza place 34 doors up and never been disappointed there
I love this place Disco watching football matches good food  drinks all awesome 
A great venue great for a dance reasonably priced and cocktails and well done Owner fabio was lovely and made us feel very welcome
Excellent place for a few drinks and to watch the football staff made us feel welcome during our stay and also has great prices Would recommend to anyone
I only ordered a drink and was happy to go to the ground floor Not a big fan of basement pubs Its well located but too dark for my liking
Literatka might be my favourite cafe to sit and chat with my friend in Wrocaw The waiters are friendly and knowledgeable and willing to answer our questions about the products Outdoor seating available in spring and summer Two parts available for sitting inside Inside there is a smaller and illuminated seating area at the front entrance compared to the rear The back is much larger than the front smoking is free and has a 2nd floor Prices are one click above the general average of the city There is no atmosphere like any music or party inside Thats why you can see the middle age group chatting inside but also the student group who study In short it is a very nice place for calm bodies and souls to sit down have a drink chat and spend time
Honestly this has been the best pub weve ever been to The interior signature drinks and hospitality have made our night in Wroclaw If youre looking for a great night out with fantastic service and alcohol you gotta drop by  Huge props to our bartender for the night Kamila Hope well come by again soon 
Waited for 20 mins to get drinks Lavender haze is very light aviation is sour but inexpressive and small drink
This place is just a really relaxing place to have drinks and a smoke competent wait staff and great tasting Gins whiskeys and beers even busy the service is quick I am happy to visit this place over and over
Excellent gin cocktails Lot of choices and good advices
Bar is tended by true hobbyists of gin and anything related to stronger liqueur I recommend trying it out to see how gin can be trully different and adaptable to your taste Gin  tonic you drank before is nothing compared to what you can get here Stay open and explore different experiences
Lovely place BUT there is no drinks menu the waiter offered us a gin with tonic for 55 zl ea however he havent mentioned the price my girlfriends had guiness for 30zl ea I mean prices are crazy and the worst thing is there is no info about it No price list on the table its alarming
I was here on One of the happiest day of my mast year and Agnieszka made this day even better One of the best bartenders Ive met Honestly she rocks
Great atmosphere and nice pub food staff are very friendly and helpful Also if you are a smoker and fan of postpunkthe cure etc go down stairs Heaven
Lovely atmosphere a lot of international events langauge events and amazing beers and snacks It was good to be back after a long time Food menu has updated options for vegans vegetarian The bar makes some exclusive cocktails do ask 
Bit dissapointed in music some weird sad polish hip hop Staff seemed unhappy too Expected different mood
Interesting bar in the underground 4 stars for getting the wet glass for beer with water leftover in it
Good service good cocktails but not enough alcohol inside
I recently visited Papa Bar in Wroclaw and had an amazing experience The highlight of my visit was definitely the hostess Viktoria She made us the most delicious cocktails and took the time to explain the ingredients in detail Her proficiency in English and French made our visit even more enjoyable She was super friendly always had a smile on her face and made our time there unforgettable  The ambience of the bar was perfect for a weekend hangout The party music was great and created a fun and lively atmosphere The staff were all very friendly and accommodating making us feel welcome from the moment we stepped in  Overall I would highly recommend Papa Bar to anyone looking for a great night out in Wroclaw With Viktorias amazing cocktails and the fantastic atmosphere this bar is a mustvisit I give it a 100 recommendation
Very nice and big cocktail bar with really good cocktails The service was also great Average price of a cocktail 40 zloty
I was last week with my girlfriend and Konrad made us one of the best cocktails we have ever tried He was really professional the whole time and spoke in English with us For sure we will repeat
Just went in for late night drinks When you walk into the main door of what appears to be a theatre there are two bars one on right  one on left The bar on the left which we went into allowed smoking Very art deco with candles 25 PLN for beer  wine Wine choices are limited as in most places in city bars to red white and dry semi dry
It was a place I heard a lot about before With her suggestion to chat with my friend I finally came across my path after 1 year Contrary to what you might think from the outside it has a very small area inside Prices are not cheap enough to say wow not too expensive either Beer is 12 zloty255 I did not fully understand the concept as I went once It had a quiet atmosphere until midnight but after a certain hour the tables downstairs were removed the DJ came and the atmosphere turned into a nightclub Frankly I didnt like to find myself in a noisy environment like a night club while I was just wanting to chat with my friend that night but as I said I went for the first time I dont know the concept When we asked for an ashtray the waiter told us that smoking is prohibited but no one cared about electronic cigarette smoking inside
Another great find in Wrocaw  Art cafe totally justifies the art it wears in its title Located right in the city centre next to the university of Wroclaw main building this place is worth checking out They have a super vibrant interiors and nice seating space with dedicated sections for smokers and non smokers Great music and amazing staff You can work here all day long or stay for the night to get darker and grab a beer and dance to the tunes of amazing music being played here Give it a shot when youre in or around city center
What a setting for a barbistro in Wroclaw Great atmosphere great choices when it comes to drink and friendly and efficient service staff The place itself is a mustsee Two entrances here one small area for beers seatings at the counter and few indoor ones and the second one with great seating options there is also a terrace
Breakfast and lunch  Excellent coffee choices  Breakfast and lunch items are delicious we already tried many positions  Service is always very friendly   This place is little hidden in the middle of a apartment complex
Delicious place a bit outside of city centre but worth visiting The interior is beautiful and the dishes are tasty  Tip ask for a bread with butter if you want more in addition to the soups Its amazing and was served free of charge for us
Good breakfast nice capuchino quiete atmosphere inside living area
Popular breakfast restaurant hala monko   my disappointment shakshuka with egg shell and hair its combo 290923
if youre looking for a great place and good beer where the service is quick and polite and the music and atmosphere is awesome this is a place for you
A great bar Lovely locals and great beer Would recommend coming here for a few beers Bar staff always really welcoming Darts downstairs in the basement which is always fun too
Perfect place to watch football matches while enjoying beers with friends  Reason for not getting 5 stars was two TVs were not working
Im Irish and I visit Poznan regularly Tanners is a great pub The Guinness here is really good and consistent Its a stone throw from the old square Highly recommend it for a group of lads wanting a good afternoon or a group on a staycation Its football friendly and has a lot of draught beers Highly recommend
Beers are good and there are plenty of seats and an inside smoking room which was packed We sat in the main bar which has lots of interesting art and paraphernalia on the walls The toilets are pretty dirty and disgusting however with no seatslocks on doorssoaphand dryers
Another absolute classic of Poznan nightlife Prices arent what they used to be but the decorations havent changed since ever
Nice place to sit with a group of friends  not as crowded and lound as other pubs in the neighborhood Both smoking and nonsmoking areas reasonable prices good drinks nice climate with rock music
Nice place to chill and it has indoor smoking room
Cool place Same old atmosphere even after twenty years
Coziest bar ever I could Tay here for hours eclectic and welcoming like a living room
The place looks very cozy and the bartender made amazing custom cocktails Totally recommend
Really nice quirky pub with lost of books and art around They play smooth jazzy music thats perfect background for evening chats with friends Only downside its cash only and the are no IPAs on the menu however other drinks choices are plenty
Nice Bar very cheap prices compared to the other bars around Cool vibes definitely will come back
A Great bar A huge selection of cocktails in a building that has an amazing atmosphere and surroundings The drinks are all very cheap especially for the location Well worth a quick visit
Its a good n cheap place u will get discounts on tuesday by 50
Cute little retro bar within the Old Square
everytime I pass through Poznan railway station I break my lifelong vegetarianpescatarian lifestyle And all that sacrifice to devour a home made pork cutlet I will make amends when Im back in London I promise 
Absolutely incredible local bar and grill I had the chuck steak and a few sausages and they were amazing Take the time to check it out
Super hidden but good people good place good food
only a few things from the menu were available
Everything in this place reminds of what taverns used to look like in the late 70s early 80s It is pretty dark in there but thats how it is supposed to be You get to see old radios old cassette players pretty much every gadget from that era Beer is a lot cheaper than most of the places in the area
Nice place to drink a beer Looks a bit old and could use a upgrade
A cool place with a good service and a wide variety of drinks And of course rock music
Good variety of beers great music helpful barmans basically  I really like to spend time there Nice garden for springsummer season
Super friendly bar staff Great atmosphere Great beer
Just a perfect craft bar 8 taps mostly from one loca brewery A lot of bottles  Beer snacks both meet a veggie Friendly stuff nice guests
Great place  after a fun night I left my jacket with my car keys on Saturday night at the bar I was due to fly home on Sunday before the bar opened  I called them up and they sent out the barman to open the place early so I could retrieve my jacket and car keys Excellent customer service  much appreciated Thank you
Great selection of craft beers There is board behind the bar that helps you pick what type of beer would you like to drink which I think is amazing thing really really helpful People working there are always willing to help with a choice
Honestlly  its my favorite place in Poznan Staff are very friendly  helpful Service is excellent Atmosphere is very classy  peaceful Everything was super nice every time I went there Thanks to the management  the staff Special big thanks to Sacha Aga  Gosia Dram Bar is highly highly recommended
Soft light big cocktail list recommend the specials life music at evenings We tried food course soup main and dessert can recommend only the meat 
I heard Jazz and I followed the music and I ended there It was live music No entrance fee I had a good table for one I asked for nonalcoholic cocktail and a chocolate dessert both were great Good prices Nice service I would recommend it
We went there as part of the restaurant week Every few months they rearrange the restaurant This time it was Harry Potter style You can see posters and flying brooms on the walls Live music every Wednesday The food is proper However portion rabbits could be a bit bigger Lovely staff
Nice place to meet if you want to talk
A great place to hang out with friends delicious drinks and friendly service
Nice place for a beer in the center of Pozna

Absolutely great food wonderful service and atmosphere  Very reasonable price
This place is a hidden gem It almost doesnt fit in poznan Pizza is 1010 better than most dedicated pizzerias ans their main course are always perfectly executed
Its a place with very good service Helpful friendly and very professional Food was only decent so only 4 stars Another small minus for the feeling of ongoing constructions
Nice small corporate dinner
Amazing food Cheese burger was to die for Best Ive ever had in my life  Service was 1010 and atmosphere was even better  I literally could not recommend any better
Not quite sure what made it Irish apart from a flag and some Guinness but thats not the point Great bar in a great location and lots of sports on Beer and food was spot on Just remind the bar staff that lager should never come in a Guinness glass and vice versa
Grass is becoming one of our favourite places in Gdask The food is OK snacks and some burgers go perfect with beers they have Guinness is amazing We went there when Liverpool played to Real the atmosphere was great and audience was nice too Staff is good and helpful This place is worth visiting
Ended up choosing this place when we first arrived Even though it has a bar atmosphere it has plenty of menu options to choose from Here I ended up getting the duck and onion pierogi My companions got the burger and ribs good comments all around Staff was great the checked in every so often
About as Irish as an English cup of tea Polish food fake UK interior polish beer
Food was nice but staff not very helpful Asked was there a place to get a taxi and was informed they didnt know but when we walked out the door we saw one to the left of the pub about half minute walk
A bit strange because its nothing like a Celtic or Keltic pub apart from a few posters including a map of England  However it grows on you when youre there for a while  Live football and decent Guinness for central Europe are pluses as is the outside terrace  The staff were very kind friendly hardworking and attentive I particularly appreciated a couple of checks to see if we were okay after a very drunk guy sat down to talk to us We didnt mind at all but that sort of care deserves to be recognised because it wouldnt happen everywhere
Fantastic pub in Gdask and I must say it exceeded all expectations The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive with Maja standing out as a shining example of excellent service She introduced us to the delightful Ksice Pszeniczne beer which was a true revelation and added a unique touch to our evening  The atmosphere of the pub was simply amazing  it had a warm and welcoming vibe that made it the perfect place to enjoy and unwind with friends
Really loved the vibes down there Great value for the price Amazing place definitely will go back
Very bad servicetoo late
Lovely place

Amazing atmosphere and the dj was great but the food wasnt exactly compelling Better grab a meal somewhere else before coming
Best hangoutpub in Gdansk Cheap drinks and good vibes However some of the daytime staff are slightly rude
Vrey nice place Most For Lokal polish but we enjoy a lot  Very good prices for the drinks
Disgusting dirty bar wity very watered down cocktails caught the barmaid selking mojito with only water added unbelievable
Best bar in gdansk Lucas is a Great host Food is amazing The aperitif of cherry alcohol is to die for Wine for the wife excellent and the fizz cider is unreal Looking forward to coming back 5 stars
One of the most cozy non pretentious places in Gdask Old Town Best bartenders and good prices simple and tasty food with a Czech twist And Czech Pilsner You can order Hladinka Mliko Snyt or Rezane
Nice Urquell pilsners and the bartender complimented my Aabshirt
I love this place from first look to menu Small cozy bar with bestest beer Prices surprised and make you happy
simple cheap and lovely nice view and some food stands next to the bar
What a lovely place  we came here every year 
Cheap beer very good
Best Bar in  Town
Ok place for a lunch or a quick dinner Relaxing atmosphere and liedown swinging chairs with lots of pillows Whiskey theme everywhere even in the menu Fun
I was there for dinner with my wife and kids  The place has really good vibe People are smiling and talking  Price semiexpensive but there is no worry about it at all  Staffs are super nice all problems will be solved by them in any case  Drinks Whiskey on the rock was mine It was Fantastic  Foods Pork ribs  recommending Beef dry fry  quite heavy with a lot of cheese and piece of beefs we ate with our own meals and it was more than enough Chicken wings  like Korean hot chicken I am Korean i liked it  Baby care In the toilet you can take care of your baby without any issue  Overall it is very lively place to enjoy the party with your loved ones  I recommend you to visit this place  Youd maybe better to book the table first  Cheers
Excellent food and good looking location the service is good and friendly I had an overall good experience and will certainly be back  If you take a steak then opt for the hot stone cooking option they bring it to your table and you can heatcook your beef yourself so it will not get cold see photo
Very tasty burger restaurant placed in Gdask I was glad to see they have some vege option The salad and its sauce were particularly nice The burger bun was good and sweet yet a slightly bit too dry Still better than 80 of burgers you can find anywhere else The burger itself was very filling with the sides The sauce are super super good congrats to the chef for coming up with such recipes  The place is a bit pricy for my taste but worth trying out
Great bar with cheap drinks and friendly bar staff the home made vodka shots are greatAnd the music is the best
Great place for a drink tasty cocktails and they make their own very good flavoured vodkas
These were the worst cocktails Ive ever tasted in my life
Ola is the best very good pubu good alcohol and very good atmosphere
Great place great service great atmosphere The best casseroles Ive ever eaten the soup is brilliant the beer is reasonably priced  next time Ill have to try the pork chop   EDIT Ive already tried the pork chop its delicious I recommend it
Amazing place You could say that its a neighborhood club next to the queue But this doesnt reflect reality We had the opportunity to participate in karaoke Very nice staff owners welcomed us as if they were their own Homemade sauce was served with the fries Pride Initially we just wanted to have a beer before the concert at Ergo arena but after the concert we came back for the after party  It was badass The whole bar was singing dancing and having a great time We stayed until the last round And we will definitely come back Greetings to the owners Keep it up my dears
Very nice service tasty food
I recommend it wholeheartedly great place pleasant atmosphere delicious food and of course the staff who were so great when I first came that I cant feel that anyone works here but rather just spends time together with customers because here that word is simply does not fit Once again a great place I recommend it
Student craft beer bar Despite me being a foreign non student I still felt very welcome here
Great place with variety of beers and plenty of board games to rent or play inside It got slightly more expensive recently due to removal of cheapest beers Sports broadcasts are usually quite quiet compared to the ubiquitous noise
Love this pub Im American spent a month in Gdansk and this was my neighborhood bar Awesome friendly helpful staff And to my surprise when I got to Poland theres a huge craft beer scene here I love that This bar has an incredible and rare selection Ive tried good ones in my many visits and added them to my untappd beer app  They play Polish sports on TV if your into that which I was watching football and basketball but TV is off otherwise with football scarves all over the walls  The music played ranges from 1960s soul Polish modern hip hop and 90s grunge rock and more Cool They have super cool die hard board game fans All types of eclectic titles a massive collection And the flavored vodkas are really good Plus popcorn Great wifi to get any work done like Ive done there or for students Bar has a cool college town vibe But not a raging party or touristy kind of scene which can be fun but not all the time like old town They speak great English too Highly recommend
A studentsoriented pub with lots of board games to play while drinking or to borrow for a small fee The bottles beer selection is really vast Decor is nonexistent Good place to go to if you dont feel like dressing up
Ive been in this place plenty of times and never understood all the negative reviews so far All waiters nice and make you feel like you somewhere in real American restaurants Food is mouthwatering Ive tried almost everything what on a menu And needless to say I am very recommending this place with all my heart
We had ribs and salomon for dinner Pretty basic Nothing special but okey Service was better than the food We paid 200zloty together w two large beer
If youre looking for a genuine tourist trap experience look no further than Fahrenheit by Jacks My recent visit to this place left me utterly disappointed and regretful From start to finish it was an absolute nightmare  To begin with the drinks were an absolute disaster The beer was served warm which is simply unacceptable Nothing kills the enjoyment of a refreshing beverage more than drinking something that tastes like its been sitting out in the sun for hours It was clear that the establishment had no regard for serving their patrons a cold and enjoyable drink  As if the warm beer and terrible service werent enough the final straw was the overall atmosphere of the place It was clear that the establishment was trying to capitalize on unsuspecting tourists luring them in with false promises The whole experience felt like a trap designed to extract as much money as possible from visitors who didnt know any better  In the end my companions and I decided that leaving was a far better option than enduring any more of this dreadful establishment We paid our bill and gladly escaped the disappointing ordeal  In conclusion I would strongly advise against visiting here Unless you enjoy warm beer awful service and feeling like a cash cow there are plenty of other places in the area that will provide a much more enjoyable and genuine experience
This place was pretty nice but there was one thing that annoyed me a glass of wine was priced at 46PLN That is an outrageous price for such a small serving of wine However leaving that aside the food was excellent and reasonably priced Our waiter was incredibly friendly and nice and the service was good I decided to order a pasta dish and it tasted absolutely fantastic Thank you so much for the great service
Watched the premier league here over the weekend Good atmosphere staff were a little slow to begin with but it was busy They were then very attentive friendly and suggested various drinks for us to try We spent a long time there and can highly recommend it A little quieter than the bars in main town so we were able to find a seat which was ideal Pizza was very nice cocktails were good and the shots were excellent
Came in for a quick drink but ended up staying longer because the staff are awesome and the atmosphere is really cool Also the guys make their own flavored vodka in house which is a must try Good drinks good music great people
Best pizza in Gdansk made in clay oven with fresh ingredients Huge choice of drinks and friendly staff Very good prices Only 28zloty for pizza and pints average 15 zloty X
What a fantastic place Happy found this on the first night and we could frequent multiple times during our stay in gdansk  The cider was one of nicest I have had also the 4x skittle shots are really nice Big shout out to best bat man  server in gdansk Jacob  top guy  Will be back here next Im in gdansk
Great location to enjoy the sports on large screens with drinks Reachable In budget Friendly staff
Great bar and shows all sport including Rugby Artur is a great owner and great craic with customers Will be going here again
Easily best pub in Gdansk hospitality customer service and prices all spot on and best around Highly recommend
Fantastic place best hospitality and the owner is a legend
Beer very good The food is quite tasty The level of waiter service today is unfortunately lower than in McDonalds  no eye contact with the customer once you manage to approach the waitress it assumes that the customer wants the bill instead of ordering the next thing  the staff should be more qualified and there should be more of them  I will check the service level again in the near future  July 27 2019  Beer unchanged still good Despite over an hours stay in the restaurant by 7 people with current orders our requests to create a joint table outside and it was logistically possible the service decided not to go along with us The increased amount of service in relation to the previous visit deserves a plus
excellent brewery very tasty beer except for American Ale it is bitter although I think its an amateur be sure to try beer bread with cheese take a big one  you will be satisfied Unfortunately we did not see at least some kind of childrens room there come Im sure you will like it  doskonay browar bardzo smaczne piwo z wyjtkiem amerykaskiego piwa jest gorzki cho myl e to amator koniecznie wyprbuj chleb piwny z serem we duy  bdziesz zadowolony Niestety nie widzielimy tam przynajmniej pokoju dziecicego chod jestem pewien e ci si spodoba  excellent brewery very tasty beer except for American Ale it is bitter although I think this is not for everyone Be sure to try the beer bread with cheese take a large one  you will be pleased Unfortunately we didnt see any childrens room there come Im sure youll like it
Delicious beer  Great atmosphere I recommend it
Very good beer for not much money
I bow to you shashlik is poetry the price destroys the competition Currently I dont know of a place that could come close in terms of taste and price to this openair museum of yesteryear 
The climate is specific but very positive The skewers are insane Everything Ive heard about them is true Perfectly seasoned with pork fat onion even now my mouth is watering just remembering it  and cold bottled beer All at a bbb affordable price I will definitely come back
Fantastic shashlik pomegranate beer at competitive store prices polite and helpful service and firstclass clientele One of the last such places in Europe You have to survive I recommend
Well its impressive I thought that such a relic from the Polish Peoples Republic would only be seen in a film An amazing contrast with the Hilton located opposite the loop with rooms from PLN 500 upwards Here a beer for PLN 3 we only pay in cash a pork shashlik for PLN 44 a portion of chicken for PLN 35 I sincerely recommend it the lady serving is very nice the company is great I agree with the other opinions it is a bar from another era
We stopped here for late lunch service was fine food was very tasty There is ongoing reconstruction of river bank so view is not so awesome now But still it was good experience
Great little spot for a restaurant by the river The serive was great the pizza was awesome and the beer was cold Ticked all the boxes for me
Place for tourists overpriced with just ok food They have burgers pizza and those big potatoes with feeling Its easy to find a spot here normally without wait as they have a lot of tables and jus okish food Drinks and beers also overpriced but this is how it is when you go to old town I would still choose other place then here Burger was a bit tasteless And I didnt even get a tomato source or anything to dip the French fries in But toilets are clean which is nice Service a bit slow but at least very helpful
Good food
Beautiful cozy bar in the middle of town High quality cocktails especially liked Minimalism The Baltic Martini is a great option to expand the range of flavors youve tried even though you likely will not order it on a daily basis Very worth a visit
Cozy bar with 1930s decor and artsy fartsy cocktails All drinks are uniquely prepared with delectable presentation Some are quite exotic such as the Bloody Mary or simply delightful such as the Avant Garde We love all the drinks that we ordered
I couldnt recommend this bar more We discovered it completely accidentally as we were escaping the rain outside and later we realised we got lucky This is not only drinks but also an experience as they have a big variety of drinks of unique flavours and representation
One of the best cocktail bars Ive been to The cocktails are well balanced  full of flavour and not too strong The recipes are creative and service is excellent They play nice jazz music and its a great atmosphere I highly recommend this place
absolutely amazing atmosphere for some reason i felt like inside some retro space opera series when staff asked for orders a the bar i felt rather like family or friend than customer
Maya is the best host of a bar Ive ever been to
Very friendly place  with great style video tapes  old tvs  retro but funky  decent prices  Only down side is  only 2 unisex  toilets  so even men queue  But hey  its worth it  just dont wait until the last minute
I was there with my girlfriend on New Years Eve on b4 party and I was very positively surprised Nice service good prices but most of all the ambience  wow D Very cool Happy to found this place
Really cosy place with interesting decorations and a great choice of beer The large and full chiabata came well prepared Staff is friendly  helpful and quick on their feet Bonus points for speaking English 
Great food great beer As soon as we discover this place we recommend it to all of our friends We sometimes go there just to eat ciabatta with grilled chicken
The beer is nice but there is a weird smell It doesnt ruin the vibe of the place though Id say it adds to it 
Small but cozy place  great for going with friendgirlfriend of Friday for a beer or coctail informal style It was build as a ship from 16 century and you feel it Friendly staff and normal prices 10zl beer 35 zl meal Things to improve  not much small snack or nibbles in menu  Honest opinion
Lovely pub good vibes and good service
Nice sport pub Good space big screen and cold beer
This arboretum is maintained by students at one of the many local universities in the Lehigh Valley area Its tucked away on a back road in Northampton County Its got about five different walking trails some groomed and some not There are a some rare species of trees especially in the conifer section of the arboretum I love this place Its peaceful and quiet and quite frequently I am the only person in attendance Its not that far off the beaten path that you can get into trouble
Amazing atmosphere Cool people and ofcourse great Szczecin Pogo spirit 
Friendly  staff
Very good pizza  I order it almost every Saturday worth recommending
Very nice service the pub is quite friendly because the same people meet there since the opening of this place
Friendly service nice atmosphere delicious food as always I recommend this place
The security was really unfriendly and  unprofessional We went inside with a group of 6 We had to hand in all our clothes even hoodies even tho we were cold They said its going to be 10 Z for the Wardrobe service In the end it was 20 Z and the guy did wanted to have 30 Z We had some rum and cokes The mixture was awful the Pepsi Coke that they used was either our of date or open for some days because it didnt had any gas anymore The drink was also mixed badly Prices for drinks were ok tho The music wasnt that good it seemed like a spotify playlist Totally not wurf to pay 20 Z per person to go inside I rather throw my money coin by coin into the Oder By doing that I have more fun and a better time then at the Boston 0 out of 5 Stars
If you got some cash you wanted to spend dont you ever think to visit this place  Security does completely nothing Also you may be kicked out of your table just because the guys you let to sit near you starts complaining that this table is their Even if youve ordered one  By the way there is no such a thing like manager If you ask someone who is in charge everyone from the staff will escape from you  1 star out of 193
Very nice place to go It was a great time and great fun was had They were a super friendly bunch of people who wee very fun informative and pleasant to be around I would go again for sure 
Open until 3 am sometimes until 6 am free entry very small place not very appealling good offers sometimes like buy 1 beer get one free Dance music disco polo electronic
Small but charming place with cheap beers
Crowded but its ok to stop there from time to time Not the best quality pub
Nice place with nice music not to loud so you dont have to scream with your friendsThe bartender was very nice  created a drink that just fit in my mood 
Pretty crowded but I would still recommend it as a good place to start an evening with friends
We loved it A bar and cinema Its cosy cool and very relaxed The chairs are likecinema but with tables and other kind of chairs around and they have good options of beers and drinks also some snacks During the hours we were there they screened Serpico Flashdance and an alive concert from Nirvana The films were shown with original sound and polish subtitles so for those who dont speak polish like me and wont be able to follow the subtitles I recommend seating in front so you can better listenunfortunately the sound was not so loud and of course people are talking as its also a bar Really cool Totally recommend
Cool place to chill drink beer watch a movie and hang out with friends I really liked the atmosphere there Staff is super nice too
Very casual place Film posters on every wall You can watch a movie there in English as well There are 10 taps Tap list is somewhat messy but Ive seen worse Furniture is shabby but no one cares   Bartender was a bit arrogant so I wouldnt converse with him longer than necessary Good thing is that craft spirit is alive and well here my partner ordered a beer but it finished while bartender was pouring it so he got what was already in the glass for free Generally that is a rule of thumb craft pub ethics essentials if you will however many socalled craft beer pubs dont respect and dont follow the rule anymore so its always nice to be in the place where staff knows how to be classy There is a kitchen so you can order something to eat here burgers for sure I dont know if theyre decent didnt give them a go However pubs kitchen obviously lacks proper ventilation because the air was literally soaked with fragrances of hot oil frying meat etc which was not pleasant at all
Quite nice place in center of Szczecin Its not a fancy design place but have very specific climat to hangout with firends Music is medium loud so I was able to chat without screaming On bar i have found a lot of different kind of beers I believe they dont serve mixed drinks but i havent asked for one Im pretty sure I will get back there
This place is awesome It has great beers nice music and a very friendly owner I recommend the office to everybody who enjoys a good beer and some chilled company 
The place is somewhat eclectic and very casual There are just 8 taps and some bottles Unfortunately bartender was not helpful he just wanted to sell beer and was not interested in helping customers  So dont hesitate and ask for samples  its the only option if you want to be truly satisfied with what you get
They have an extensive selection of local Polish beers including unusual fruity sours And the barmen really knows what to recommend
Great craft beer shop  only 8 taps but a lot of craft beer on cans and glasses Good prices mixed crowd Would be nice with a list of cans in the fridge
New brewer Its a brewery with a restaurant and bars inside The menu is full of different dishes and a good range of drinks are available including their own brewlarger Different sports are shown on the big screens  around the place The staff are friendly and welcoming they offer a menu in English Toilets are available downstairs Weve been here a few times over the years and we are never disappointed Its great value for money   The only recommendation would be to offer a kids menu  
Awesome place for a beer delicious and served in large portions for reasonable prices However their payment process is a bit chaotic because if your specific server is not around it can take a while to pay because they always have to double check with them Not optimal but if you ask for a bill when served it should be fine
Nice place the food we had was very good the stuffservice could be much better and more friendly
Will lead off with its very loud in there not talking about people talking but the brewing Breakfast is served until noon  The food was very delicious especially the chili chicken which was very flavorful I went their mainly to try that and everything else was secondary They have 5 beers on tap the IPA was out
Really nice pub in the center of Szczecin Not so expensive great beer and cocktails Theres also a room downstairs with Dards
Wonderful local pub Bar staff brilliant and very creative cocktail mixers Friendly atmosphere and the locals were very receptive of us 
One of the best pubs in Szczecin Just far enough from deptak to be nice and cozy

In this murky pub you can expect the bartender to be rather pricky but thats the whole charm A lot of old polish punk cigarette smoke and people with weird tattoos Also darts
Nice atmpsphere and nice assortiments of drinks
If you are a metalhead a rocknroll fan or you simply like heavy music this is the best place for you Very nice music service and good beers Also a place for people who like to play darts I met many wonderful people here whom I will remember forever
This is special If you dont like Rock dont go there You will have a brought variety of good rock music and a fantastic variety of drinks up to very good Scottish whiskey The atmosphere is good and the bartender is a really nice guy
Nice place Quick service Good selection of drinks  Friendly locals  Personally i dont understand the reviews about the smoking room  My partner absolutely hates smoke and the only non reserved table was next to the open smoking room  She didnt smell any smoke and many were smoking extraction system more than adequate Only negative is that because the smoking room is so big  non smokers need to reserve a table in the other parts of the pub at busy times  Glad i smoke then haha
Lovely bar Only problem they allowed smoking in a certain area
Great bar one of our favourites when were visiting Bydgoszcz They do an amazing coconut vodka with pineapple juice
Nice pub with great atmosphere friendly staff good music and wide selection of drinks
Friendly staff and a great selection of drinks Cool atmosphere
Atmospheric cellar bar serving an extensive range of bourbon whiskeys and a decent selection of mainly bottled beers But what sets this pub apart from others is the amazing bartender who is a real character and whose knowledge of his trade local history and just about anything is second to none Absolutely fascinating couple of hours chatting to him and a couple of his regular guests Worth the visit alone
Awesome staff and good selection of beers
Good drinks enjoy a lot 
Watching football on TV
Great interiors nice selection of drinks and most importantly Irish Stout on tap
Fantastic And Liverpool won
Nice placenice people
Despite the broadcast of the football match and a full house they were very eager to give us a seat The pizza certainly doesnt taste like in Italy but it is still enjoyable The staff is courteous speaks English and is very eager to speak English Only the ordering at the bar is a bit annoying
Excellent bar with pizza that has to be seen to be believed On average a 45 cm18 is around 34zl724 Theres a good choice of beers and Polish language pub quiz on a Sunday Id recommend reserving a table
This is the best pizza I ate in Poland
A fun and friendly place A real part of Bydgoszcz history


Closed earlier than expected cool place though
The place has its own atmosphere Nice and engaged service Reservation service at a high level everything can be arranged conveniently Thank you for the nice atmosphere and service at the company event 
Great atmosphere great music if you want to relax and chill Great drinks the bartender gives great advice and makes drinks tailored to your taste I would highly recommend
A beautiful place fantastic music regardless of the time sensational prices for the Polish pocket and full professionalism of the service including the bartender Mateusz who also knows how to advise your taste very well And also very clean and pleasant atmosphere I highly recommend  Alcohol and coffee rock
Great boozer Cheap as chips Friendly service spoke  lent me a phone charger
American guy visiting I really like the simple pricing of the items in this place and the prices are fair as well one price for any food item another price for any drink  I tried this Polish delicacy and I LOVE it herring with onions and oil fresh bread Warm up with a cold vodka shot  Lastly thus place is open after the whole rest of the town is closed Welldone
Decent  not sure you can use some random drinks to serve people in a public place however the service needs to improve bit arrogant behind the bar prices are ok for very tiny drinks
Called in with some friends as they recommended it Only had a few shots but what a brilliant place the drinks we had were very good It was quite late on a weekday when we called in I can imagine its a brilliant place to go on a weekend
Clean and professional


Nice beer bar If you go to Bydgoszcz you must visit it
I recommend this place you can pure Guinness for yourself There is also dj too and outside area with some fun throwing game Open till 2 am on weekend For the owner I recommed to think about darts game inside that would add even more
One of my favourite beer bar Its quite new and has a nice interior  How to get the beer Go to the bar ask for a beercredit card you change charge it with individual amount of money most are 20 50 to 100 pln The deposit price for the card is 5 PLN  Next to the bar is a shelf with glasses you take one whatever you like and then go to the beer draft dispenser you place your card in there little card holder and you can draft your own beer  On the draft station there are pressure places with water to clean your glass if you wish to Please remember before you leave you bring your used glass to the second shelf where the used glasses are  Thursday is live DJ evening very recommended You are albe to make reservations The staff speaks fluent English  Special promotion they have beer for 100ml to 1 PLN is worth a visit  Other brands are Brooklyn Brewery Guinness Kronenbourg 1664 and a lot of flavoured beer like passion fruit gelato citrus cherry strawberry and so on  The bar is very clean and cosy  I recommend a visit
Fantastic concept and selection shame bar guy was only interested in talking to the only other customer girl friend
I listen to a good story related to a good craft beer and am satisfied with the service of Marcelina and glad to hear the history of craft beer which she recommends to me Thank you I wish all the best and recommend this place for chilling out
The place has changed a lot tables lights crew beer garden and yet it has retained its hard rock metal atmosphere Definitely worth a visit if youre in Bydgoszcz
A really cool rock n roll pub with a great range of craft beers Good music too
Amazing craft beers on tap and bottles  at affordable prices Classic and underground rock music also on plus bartenders are knowledgeable about what theyre serving
The view of the river was fabulous The Indian food was outstanding Recommend the Cheese Plate as well Will be returning
beer is not good despite they brew it themselves  it was not carbonated maybe was old barrel and tasted sour only one out of four was drinkable  with honey the bar was empty but we waited 30 min for one snack dish and it was not even very tasty
Food was ok we were expecting more from the beer given stated a brewery however biggest downer was the service waiting times were extreme We were with 10 people restaurant was not full and even so  most mains tool around an hour whist the appetizers came at same time for some even after the main meal  No explanations  apparently this is considered normal   Meals itself were ok  however who wants his appetizer after its main
One of the best places I ever been Lovely locationwith great view All kinda of  flavours amazingly delicious food Best in Bydgoszcz for a night out either with friendsfamily or romantic dinnerIts my third time there  and will definitely wont be the last  Must try and see  Highly recommending
The authenticity of the place with its live music will satisfy you If you happen to pass by Bydgoszcz definitely come jazz lovers
I recommend this place great for music lovers Many gigs during the week jazz jamming friendly for young artists etc good to have this place in BydgoszczI like Murphys Irish Stout in there Would be nice if they would also serve Guinness maybe in future 
Very nice quite place feels like very old pub in 90ths century good atmosphere and if you want to drink peacefully without any disturbance 
Went to this place for 1st time and saw Bob Franceschini and AMC PLUS The music was exceptional the guys were tight and sounded like a band whod been playing together for years  not their first gig The venue like the Lizard King in Toru has a magical vibe The musical energy of amazing musicians has been soaked up by the walls Cant wait to visit again
Rather special atmosphere nice inner decor and fast service Really cool way to serve hot wine and barbecued meat Though I have to say the meat was too dry for my taste
Food is looks good but tastes average and there is nothing special about it Szaszlyk was good but the bread pancake on the plate was served cold and was basically tasteless The burger was average There is not much to chose from despite the waitress pointing us to the QR code to find full menu on the homepage There was not much to find there either We ordered also water but never got it We got salt that was empty The waitresses are nice but busy On a sunny weekend there is a lot of noise at the location It was nice to try this known place but next time we will go somewhere else
I just sat there to grab a beer end up getting 3 cause dont have more time Such a great vibe carefull and kind waitresses who gave me great beers  Without any doubt a spot to spot when Im Lublin
Great Pub in Lublins Old Town Totally happy I came You must try their Homemade Pils Beer St Michal and the ribs  The decoration is amazing and the service is really top class  not too mention the waitresses are quite good looking and friendly 
Lovely and welcoming atmosphere big room for group gathering and family environment Environment is also very clean Service was top tier very nice waiter that we got Generous portions of serving Great lighting in the place suitable for a couple date group date and even for just a single person outing affordable menu
Ive been to this place many of times and every time Its never gone the way it should When booking a table some staff speak English and decide to just hang up and never say sorry  Other times the food was delayed for more than 1 hour and the worst thing of all is every single staff ignore you and keep clear away when you ask for assistance Ive currently been waiting for someone to turn on the TV and set the football game to what I want and Ive already missed 30 mins  I have asked 3 different people and on the third try someone finally turned on the game which took 3 mins  I might as well watch the games at home and avoid this embarrassment
I love their idea of private sitting areas they are beautiful cubicles Their pizza is ok  And the ladies are great and cheerful The place is  large and a spacious Many bars and sitting areas its beautiful I will be going there again
The pizza wasnt  greati was very dissapointed having gone there  craving itto top it all i ordered Jack Daniels double and they were each garnished with a slice of lemon oh dear never Had such a horrible taste in my mouth
nice place for bikers  a meeting point for people driving motorcycles
Good music great stuff
Best bar in lublin
Fine
Lovely food great location if you like watching weddings During branch we had a pleasure to observe at least 3 wedding parties arriving at the registry office opposite Really good service staff were attentive and with a good knowledge of English
Our goto for breakfast in Lublin Excellent food friendly staff really cozy atmosphere Not a ton of places are open early in Old Town Make sure to try Trybunalska for a Lubelskie breakfast sandwich on Cebularze
My wife and I stopped here for a drink each and to share a piece of cake on a hot sunny Wednesday afternoon in July This restaurant offered plenty of seating in the shade to keep us out of the sun We chose blueberry cheesecake a mug of iced chocolate and a mug of frozen caramel latte and all were absolutely delicious The service was really friendly too I would definitely recommend
We ordered some wings when we got there and it took over an hour for them to come There was also a misunderstanding on how we wanted our eggs done and the first response was unprofessional However the food was delicious but I am not pleased
Low prices delicious food and no crowds What more could you want  Edit Prices still low food average but customer service is at a very low level Personally for the first time I met with a refusal to prepare an order because of I dont want to because I will have to wash up The owner cuts into a conversation with friends to bring up his own unrelated thoughts Unfortunately after 3 years of sporadic visiting this place I decide to change
The service woman is very nice but unfortunately her husband is her total opposite Rude and simple I reported that the beer I bought was 6 MONTHS out of date I received money from the lady unfortunately when her husband found out about it he started shouting at me and kicked me out of the place then added that no one would serve me here anymore Failure
Unfortunately the opinion about the place has changed the menu is poor the decor is poor the service is average Rough and additional prices for premises of a much higher standard Reheated food my dumplings were cold inside
Great place the food is really delicious and typically homemade I often go there for dinner and every day there is a different dish of the day that is worth ordering The portions are really big and the price of PLN 14 for a twocourse dinner is good
I always visit there when Im in Lublin greetings from Krakow to the guests and owners 
Best bar in the area good service nice guys cheap prices overall nice atmosphere
Nice and polite service great atmosphere
A nice place to relax drink a beer and have something to eat
Mega
Great atmosphere and lovely service I will definitely come back here on my next visit to Lublin I had a wonderful time my head rested and I felt well taken care of I highly recommend it 
Friendly lady behind the bar Unfortunately there is a musty smell inside
Overall the place is ok but Theres not much space there and the toilet is dingy  but they have nice rock karaoke 
Good place to pick up chicks
Great place to dance for all ages  Nice staff Greetings to Mr and Mrs goalkeepers from September 29 
First class service Always nice and polite Dart does a good job on Thursdays and Saturdays I recommend checking it out
The great advantage of the place are moderate prices Its great that there are two playrooms Each DJ plays different music There are always a lot of guests and this is where it becomes a problem Owners should consider a more efficient ventilation system Sometimes its hard to breathe and the place is underground Koleknybklopot is a small cloakroom especially in winter But despite these small inconveniences the place is worth recommending Always good fun I recommend
Super fresh and yummy home made style food Visited on Saturday we tried Rosol Schabowy Pierogi Wiejskie Everything was delicious and both ladies wereare friendly sexy  and welcoming XX
Surprisingly deliciously good food 
Tasty food inexpensive price Perfect Special food feels like home made Id very enjoyed here this is unusual and its great
Irish pub with several floors and a great selection of drinks
It was our first dining experience in Bielsko Biala We did not know anything Place is out of city centre not too far They had tables inside and outside Let me just say 1010 for this establishment If youre reading this review and planing to go to BB than i highly recommend Very tasty We had set meal of the day tomato soup with croutons which was out of this world and pork with silesian dumplings and traditional silesian beef rolada with silesian dumplings and red cabbage And you know what As stupid as it sound even water we got wad impressive Big cold glass of water with plenty of ice and lemon On hot summer Polish day they managed to impress us with that To finish some places try to make customers happy And this place is one of them 
This is a very very spacious barrestaurant It opens early and closes pretty late I had their English breakfast in the morning a burger and fries for lunch and later in the evening  I tried their drinks menu No regrets tasty food and excellent customer service
Been here a few times Good service good food and the location is next to the BB castle Nice outside seating for the fair weather months Bunch of tvs to watch games live
Fantastic food and wonderful service by a sympathetic waitor Thank you you made our days with kids
I have moved here from another place pod Zamkiem Well it is better so 3 stars but it is nothing like what it was 4 or 5 years ago You just need to look at beer bottles over the bar to see what we are missing There are so many great Polish craft breweries so serving everage beers is really sad Then if you can make more money serving average beer to average drinker why not
Good and frequently changing beer selection cosy atmosphere
Great craft beers
Great atmosphere Great beers Pickles and cheeses are plentiful Go and eat and drink
Fantastic food and very nice staff The menu has a broad offer of different dishes  Mexican burgers but also Thai there were also lot of vegetarian options The prices were not elevated however the quesadilla was rather small for its price  not entirely fulfilling Very spacious patio highly recommend
What an Awesome place In the heart of the City with incredibly nice surrounding area Szpilka or simply  The Pin is definitely the Best restaurantBAR up there With A great selection of food and drinks friendly stuff and a smart industrial ambiance this cosy restaurant is on the TOP of my list in This mesmerising City The whole menu is affordable and very well thought out Everyone will easily find something for herhimself A solid portion plus a drink in between 715 sounds great You also have vegetarian and vegan options PS Ask for a cocktail Menu and you wont regret it
We have chosen this restaurant as first one during our stay in this city and region It was very good choice Food service everything was very good
The food is ok however service needs an improvement male waiters are extremely nice very knowledgeable but ladies working there have attitude it seems like they are doing you a favor taking an order from you or just in general attending you Myself and my wife were very disappointed because we really like the place and so far we were always served by males but once again Ladies working thereyou need to work on your manners  rolling the eyes making faces and in general being rude
The music is great on a Saturday night if you like the 80s If not its a struggle average age of clientele is erelderly Good drinks and generally clean placebut it wont set your heart beating thats for sure
It has a very good environment for 2 hours concerts Always you can find something special there
Great climate place Live music concerts Nice salsotekas and milongas
Fantastic
10 for a pint of Guinness I suppose this is more a reflection of Oslo prices than this venue but shocking nonetheless  Staff were very friendly and poured a decent pint of Guinness which is all you can ask for
Great authentic dark wood pub Very cosy top staff friendly atmosphere and great free live music Best Irish Pub in Oslo
A good pint of Guinness Its all I can ask for a good night There was music in live and it was nice too
The generic hit cover musician killed the vibe for me Some quite inebriated people appeared to enjoy it but I am not that fond of those either
Wow Fantastic bar Loved the beer Ambience was amazing Good vibes
Nice place located right in the centre of Olso The decor is really invitingUsual prices in Oslo Service is not great even in quiet times ignoring the customers waiting whilst they have a chat bit sad since its actually a nice venue
Nice bar and prices are lower then the rest than the city Recommend
Authentic British Pub in the heart of Oslo approx 5 mins away from Oslo Central railway station Kind staff tasty beers and a cosy flair I had two very nice stays in July 22  and well come again very soon
During a boat trip to Oslo I was invited by the band to come and hear them play that night  I went in to eat around 6 and went back later for the band  Great atmosphere great people I wish I could move the pub to Belgium 
Great bar to watch a football match close to Heineken Brewery as well
Ordered irish stew with extra bread The stew was tasty but for the price I expected abit more of it The bread was too compact for my liking but could butter it up to make it more eatable Unfortunately I only received 1 pack of butter even thou I ordered extra bread  The beer was good   The fellow at the bar was nice and friendly   A very nice pub to visit for some afterwork socialising 
By far long and wide THEE BEST IRISH PUB not only in Norway  but the world better than Irish pubs back home  great Guinness too 
The place is cool with activities sometimes quiz and blindtest But during them you cant use the 8pool
Very cozy pub perfect for watching football Huge amount of TVs around all the pub Prices are quite good also
Really like the place for watching sports But its kinda expensive beer
The best Guinness in Norway one of the cheapest Guinness in Oslo Great for all sports with plenty of TVs all around the bar Always a great visit
Amazing place in Oslo Very unique and beautiful restaurant in the heart of Oslo The food is amazing and the service is on another level I ordered a pint of beer and pizza diavola and it was lovely  
Best Guinness in Oslo by far Perfect temperature creamy head and good pull Highly recommended for a pint of the creamy stuff I also had a good Shepherds pie Definitely will be coming back
A great bar with good food snacks and some nice beer Its a bit unusual that from Ireland they only have Guinness on the menu which unfortunately they were out of in the entire Oslo region but we were offered a beer that wasnt on the menu and it was a dark Irish beer Its great that they have live music a good selection of songs on the radio as well old rock mostly interesting ambience pictures of famous Irish people quite cute but  they have Caitriona Balfe but no Niall Horan  and ok facilities We voted that we would come back Hopefully next time there is some Guinness
The Wild Rover burger is amazing in general all food is really good And the place is very nice The service is good and the people is kind I really recommend this pub
Nice place to enjoy Premier League game week
Nice and old brown pub Sports pub that is they show Premier League here They have a lot of different beers good menu for food and huge amount of TVs to watch sports They also have a pool table so you can play for a fee Really nice place mostly old people but also younger when there is a match or two to watch  Enjoy the place Drink a beer for me too 
Genuine classic irish pub in Oslo with great assortment Lots of tables and lots of space Also very nice window seated section there  Good atmosphere What we call a brown pub in norway which means its casual and old  They play football matches on big screen  Serves food as well the burgers where very decent Reasonable big menu  Decent selection in beer mostly pilsner and liquer  Have tables outside where you can sit Not sure about any parking though
Nice club sandwich Good place to watch football Skal
Good pint of beer nice welcome and handily situated between Karl Johans Gate and the town hall Large basement bar with smaller bar and outdoor seating at street level Bar food available
Not recommended place at all The bartenders and the security guys have mistreated us badly and rudely they took half glass of beer then when i asked for a new one they charged me for a new one Scamming people i will never come this terrible place again
Can enjoy live music on Friday and Saturday night
Nice place Its a big old chill sports pub They also play great music Old rock and such They also have cards and board games Jippi 
Pretty cool atmosphere in this pub Loved it
Cozy little place at the National Theater district Service is as friendly as it can be And wow I dont think I would have a Guinness again after having here a Murphys Irish Stout
It was one of our best nights The Guinness there is DELICIOUS and the place really has all you need We met Mats and Karianne both barkeepers and a random guy from America great guy Because I shotgunned some Guinness I had to do quests like drinking water or jumping on one foot It was really funny and I was able to complete them Looking forward seeing you again
Is not vwry expenaive irish pub Good personal
We happened to be there for a beer after Scotland beat Norway so it was a fun time of over the top celebration Very crowed but everyone was respectful Bartender was overwhelmed by orders but did his best to keep up Had a great time
Only came in for a drink while walking on Karl Johan street Pale ale I got was very good There was live music Atmosphere was nice though
Beautiful place The food was delicious we ordered burger fish and chips and the Guiness bacon All good The bacon was a little cold but still tasty The place was a bit crowded but we were able to find a table quickly Good variety of beers
Lovely pub Super friendly bar man happy to chat Nice selection of drinks available We didnt eat Very noisy and lively which was fine for us Sports Bar vibe but may be a little too much for some
Okay bartender attentive and cosy atmosphere Not very busy My Negroni was a letdown Overall not bad just nothing special If you are looking for a fairly quiet place at least on a weekday this is a fine option
Great place for a night out Staff friendly and welcoming Drink reasonably priced for Oslo Great atmosphere for watching sport or socialising Didnt eat so couldnt rate food
A great pub to watch football matches Good vibe and cosy place inside Not too crowded for a United game
Good place to have a beer while watching a game or listening to some live music They stream 6 Nations Championship as probably the only place in Oslo
Classic pub in Oslo with a great atmosphere and really friendly service A good selection of draft beers and the bartender was very helpful and kind
Good bar On the night I visited there was a fantastic piano playersinger Only problem is the toilets are downstairs Im disabled so I cant use the stairs Apart from that its still a good bar
Racists against tourist to avoid Cant handle an order of a few beers Security tells u they dont need you here never seen such a service before Wednesday 27 of September 1am
Nasty placer nasty barman rushing people Security tells us they dont need us here while choosing the draft beer Music was alright but the people serving beers and security needs to go Wed 27 1am
Wide choice of drinks super friendly staff and excellent party both on fridays and sundays love the place
Wonderfull night club with a great selection of Beers wine and cocktails It has a cozy bar on the ground floor and a dancing stage on the upper floor Totally recommended
I didnt like the experience The barwoman who served me was very unpleasant When I arrived she didnt greet me and showed me a bad face like saying what do you want I asked a beer she just put the ATM terminal in front of me and got away Then I was having some difficulty with the terminal and was trying to ask her some assistance but she didnt pay attention and was doing nothing After paying she didnt thanks not a word Regarding the environment I didnt like it as well because people in general not all of them looked very strange So my overall evaluation is very bad I think I wont go there anymore
The coffee is pretty good the seating is good the space is nice and the bartenders are excellent Since they arent allowed to advertise for alcohol I have to mention it here Their whisky selection is exhaustive and you should come here if that is your thing
If you need a beer a chat or just a free toilet this is the place at the main train station in Oslo Football and nice atmosphere is not a minus either Normal Oslo prices Reccomended
Nice pub inside Oslo Centralstation Friendly staff and fast service Located on the second floor mezzanin
Splendid pub in Oslo Central station The pub is clean very comfortable seating and excellent seating The train station is 3 minutes away
Nice pub with good beer Very friendly bartender Good place to kill the time before departure
Good service Dog friendly at least outside 
Cool place Brown bar vibe Lots of outdoor and indoor seating
Male server was discriminatory towards us He targeted our table because apparently we dont keep 1m distance from other people as per the covid guidelines when clearly all other tables at the bar does not follow the 1m distance rule either Not sure why our table was targeted perhaps because we dont speak the local language but very unimpressed how the server excluded our table and denied us service If you are an expat or a tourist this place is not recommended
Nice atmosphere Good place to relax and have a cold beer The beer selection on tap could be better but the pub itself is very cozy You are especially going to love it if you are an Arsenal fan 
Fantastic bar Amazing selection of whisky and craft beer Very reasonaboe prices extremely friendly and relaxed atmosphere Lovely staff all very polite easy to talk to and very knowledgeable of the drinks  I would really recommend this bar a highlight of our trip to Norway from the UK definately visit again and may even consider a return trip just to visit this bar
Cocktails are great and well prepared They have a great selection of beers The staff is very kind and welcoming Great decoration and ambiance Very good music Loved it 
Great whisky bar  Wide selection of whiskies from vintage rarities to more recent and affordable options Found some really nice decent price single casks to try
This pub was my favorite place in Oslo Great friendly service  amazing atmosphere and nice pool tables   Also a very good selection of beers and spirits Definitely worth stopping in for a drink   Ooo yeah they also have a very cool hidden bathroom
Nice service centrally located and screens for sports from every angle of seating Also reasonably priced Right next to both the main bus and train station in Oslo
Great prices for Oslo Malik is helpful and gave us great advice on where to visit for the best possible experience in Oslo
Pretty nice casual cafe bar at the city of Oslo Both indoor and outdoor seating is available drinks good variety of beers and coffees are served Nice for watching sports the service is good
Nastiest bathroom in Oslo Maybe not but definitely a contender
I live in Oslo for quite a long time and have been to Aye Aye couple of times but they seem to have issues with the staff  Last time I was there the female bartender found me on Facebook and harassed me Stay away from that place if you dont want to be harassed on Facebook and accused of things you didnt do Pity cause the owner is really kind and nice
One of the must visit bars in Oslo if your a metalhead and especially have an inner pirate
Great place for few drinks This is ideal for dining and have a chat with friends I believe it will be pretty crowded in situation like live music
Happened to stumble in one time and have been going back ever since Beer prices are similar to other locations nearby but theres always some interesting people around and in general it feels like a solid place to get some or twenty beers in
86kr750 for beer right next to central station Decent interior  cozy Cant complain
Fiasco is my go to place when I want a tasty beer and burger with my brother before we go out for the night The burgers are served quickly and are delicious and the beer selection is always great Ive been going here for years and never had a bad experience
This is right outside the bus station connection pedestrian overpass to the Oslo main train station The burger is supposedly very good I think its merely ok for the price
Unbeatable beer selection  with very reasonable price Have a rotating craft beer selection Plenty of burgers to choose from all have the same price and they look very attractive  never tried Its  a  lively bar Probably the best song playlist in town Nothing to complain here maybe a renovation would suffice
Has a great upstairs area for sport sport and  a good atmosphere when Liverpool games are on as they seem to be affiliated with same Beer is 112 kr for hansa which I think is expensive but you are in top location  Small baldy barman was miserable and the tall dark lad was fun
Would have given five stars but barman didnt know how to pour a Guinness i was given a guinness with a 50mm head each time we went to the bar and had to ask staff to top it up Went back next night to watch an excellent live band and a different barman Spanish  poured a perfect Guinness and even managed a shamrock So five stars to him Oh and its very expensive Good outside sitting for people watching
Lively Pub near the water in Bergen good for watching soccer and live music  Friendly staff were welcoming and helpful and the service here was much faster than other pubs in the area
Cool little pub with a Irish theme I ordered a local ipa  There were plenty of sports playing and several beers on draft  They were out of Guinness when I visited but oh well I found something else The restrooms are upstairs and I did not need to visit them nor did I try food
Nice and cozy place Super friendly bartenders
Too funny for words An Irish pub that had run out of Guinness By the way if you are after a wine it is a wide choice One red and one white and no we didnt ask
Used to be a great place for beers and sports The place has been worn down over the years and combined with littleno maintenance it is no in a really bad shape The restrooms are disgusting and the place would definitely benefit refurbishment
The pub quiz is the best one I have ever been at 
Highly recommended Looks like a place where locals go We ordered a Hansa beer and decided to have it in a beer garten as the weather was in our favor
Stumbled upon this place on my first night in Bergen while trying to find a cozy spot for a drink Im a Canadian and had never been to a bar in Norway prior to this and wasnt sure if I should wait to be seated just walk up to the bar or if there was table service at all I made an assumption and walked up to a pretty busy bartender Jans uncertain of the spelling or if I heard his name correctly ha Despite my awkward fumbling he made time to explain how best to order that there were different sizes of beer and even just welcomed me to the city and his spot  all while completely holding it down and helping other guests When I went back up for a second round I was curious about trying Norwegian aquavit and he again went out of his way by recommending specific glassware his favourites styles some history and how to cheers in Norwegian The patio is on an incredibly charming cobblestone street the beer and spirits selection are great and the service made the whole experience so memorable Loved it
Good bar with lots of nice beers Bar staff let you try things if you arent sure on the tap beers Would happily recommend
When the bar manager who just passed puberty asks you to move over you get annoyed Me and my gf spent lots of usd here and that one person ruined it for us I heard that Norwegians dont have good manners Burg this was a shock  The girls in the bars was great I guess the guy wanted to be an Alfa male 
I like this pub good selection of beer and drinks It is an informal place to meet Occasionally they will show football low volume Or have live concerts
Not to big and you can sit in a group ant talk comfortably
Great place to enjoy a beer or a drink Very knowledgable staff that give great service and can really do good drinks
Great atmosphere for conversations with background music Very friendly staff very good selection of Beer and Liquor
A nice Irish pub  I would recommend everyone to go to With nice music dating from 80s and 90s  Fun of rock  Go there
good club but im sorry for the asian hate they literally kicked out everyone in my asian group as we were not with any Norwegians at all which is very racist and judgemental Even when i went back in the club they were very adamant on asian going in I have given many google reviews and this was honestly the worst experience i have experienced so far BOOOO  sad but true
Good place to watch the football Pool tables available
One of the best pubsbars around Bergen There is a big terrace for smokers You can enjoy different beers cocktails while playing pool darts or just relaxing with your friends The music is great as well
I went there for the pubquiz and the movie night Nice atmosphere affordable drinks and friendly staff 1010 would visit it again
Stunning student bar located in the old dock
For studentsyoung adults
Best place ever
Great place but could do with dropping the price of the beer They are charging town prices They only need to drop it a little bit
Nice place n good bar some times with live music as well Great location
Best pub in Bergen
Got matt
Best bar in Norway with best barman  Brendan from Gympie Australia  39 beers on tap  whats not to like
Typical tourists we came in one night after dinner to have a taste of some local acquavite Its a dark and super chill atmosphere in one of the many cute little buildings in the center of Bergen Open late and open when loads of other places are closed
Super cool  The bar man advised a nice blonde beer that roughly translated as fresh breeze it was light  crisp  would be cool to have a jukebox
Nice little bar in Bergen They play records all night and the bartenders have some good options to play Really great beer selection tap and very friendly bartenders Worth visiting and having a cocktail
Way more expensive than we thought My friend ordered a pizza for 179 Crowns which was clearly a frozen pizza from the supermarket and I paid 149 Crowns for one Cider The ambience was nice but there was nothing special to it so I dont know how they take the liberty to charge such horrendous prices Wouldnt go there again
Small bohemian vibe sort of place Friendly helpful staff decent cocktails drinks and pizza Away from the main bar areas it felt local and relaxing
Super friendly cool place A must see spot If You have one night in Bergen Nice backyard with fresh food and excellent cocktails Ps I do not live in Bergen 
Love this place Cant get more warm and real
Super friendly staff great view nice music the food was good
Nice outside pub Good beers and friendly staff 4 stars since no longer doing food so not being advertised correctly
Always good staff n fun with sing alongkaraoke on Fridays n Saturdays
27 degree and they keep the heaters on Extremely rude server I will avoid this place in the future
Very cool bar to pass by for a drink or to play a game of billiard Billiard is quite expensive but the tables and equipment is well maintained  The flair is super cozy and the drinks are delicious
Super cool spot with excellent service  The bartender greeted me right away and helped me pick a great be the dark 7F I HIGHLY recommend checking this place out  Cheers 
A nice ambience inside but thats about it Drinks were ludicrously expensive  there are more reasonably priced places in Bergen Plus you have to pay per minute to play pool What happened to putting a coin in the machine and then taking however long you need to enjoy the game with friends
Contactless order and pay Spectacular atmosphere and inviting furniture  Lots of comfy couches that are neat classy and most importantly clean  This place is a hidden gem no matter where you find it be it New York City Miami London or Bergen You will not regret coming here and trying one of their delicious handcrafted cocktails  I recommend the cherry rye whiskey sour
We went to a handful of barspubs in Bergen and this one wasnt our favorite It was pretty loud and crowded when we were there not cozy as others described We also asked the bar tender what was in one of the cocktails and he said he didnt know because he didnt like the drink They do have free wifi though
Awesome music often less mainstream rock and pop tunes Chill atmosphere with very friendly staff Its very centrally located so its a great place for meeting up for a drink with a friend or a stranger
Definitely a local dive with no menus other than that scribbled on the chalk board Wide range of local beers and cocktails Service is very friendly and helpful with drink recommendations  Less of a tourist haunt even though its in the city Frequented by a seemingly more working adult crowd  Drinks range from 70  100 NOK which is quite standard for this city
Tasty cocktails and nice atmosphere The wait time can be long in rush hour Follow bartenders recommendations
Absolutely loved it Atmosphere is so nice cozy and beautiful This kind of bars I live Free entrance  fair price for cocktails Nice happy people We had amazing night out
The place was very cozy Very spacious between tables and seats Got its unique tropics theme decoration all over the place The bartender was very talkative and welcoming However we enjoyed the ambience more than our drinks We had an Undead and a Theodors Tipple Both drink were fine but not extraordinary Nothing really special in them and the alcohol concentration was not high as well Overall a good place to chill with an average drink in the city of Bergen
Great atmosphere and cocktails I liked that there were some interesting twists on old favorites The ordering via the QR code on the tables does not work well for people without the local payment system Its only that or credit card and it took forever to fill out all the info table details and such Ive seen this system implemented much better elsewhere In the end walking to the bar was easier
Great place to meet up with friends Good selections of drinks and cocktails Nice decor lots of plants
Great restaurant There is nothing negative I really recommend it High class service The food was great and all the guests liked it A big thank you to the kitchen and waiters
Really great find fantastic meal with friendly efficient staff
We got a seat today and the food was very delicious It was simply good Not amazing or anything that would throw me but just really good food Waiters were quick and sharp and had a good amount of attention even though the place was filling up Well balanced price value in this great place Bergen
Good quality and not too expensive for Norway
Great atmosphere and coffee Love the cozy atmosphere and the service Plan to get here early as it is popular and fills up
I was surprised when I walked into this bar It was a late sunday all coffee shops in the city were closed Vgal was kind of a last resort to try and get some decent coffee And I was really impressed Its hard to tell if I simply lucked out on the bartenderbarista or if Vgal actually requires barista skills for the job but nonetheless I was actually really impressed with both the Kenyan pourover I ordered and the latte my girlfriend got The milk had nice texture and the latte art was great Overall Id highly recommend going here The coffee is great and it had potentially my favorite atmosphere of any coffeeshop in town My only slight criticism more a recommendation than critique they only carry BKB coffee which although its gotten better and more specialty over the years it still is far behind the top dogs like Jacu Supreme and Langra So maybe having those roasteries featured as well could be an idea But then again this is a bar after all any specialty coffee is far beyond the others  Keep up the great work guys This was my first visit but itll be far from the last
Super friendly chill cute place to hang out Really good prices for food beer wine and coffee  highly recommend 
A really nice place warm and with a good vibe I loved both the atmosphere and the food the vegan cake was amazing 
Lovely restaurant with great service and servings Ordered a Royal Burger and our meals came in less than 10 mins
Good service and atmosphere Some vegetarian options They were able to make a vegan burger by removing all dressings which made the burger a bit dry The onion rings were delicious however
Amazing burgers The meat patty is nicely cooked and a bit smoky having the same taste as the burgers I cook on my grill at home The ingredients feel fresh and the burger overall is very juicy The sweet potato fries are also good its just the drinks that are a bit pricey you pay for a drink almost as much as you pay for a burger The restaurant was not too crowded ans the service is nice You can order directly from the table using your mobile phone and pay once you place the order The serving took less than 10 minutes Best burger I had at a restaurant in Norway by far 
Great burgers and the side dishes are quite generous in their sizes Drinks are on the expensive side but thats the norm in Norway  Good for a night out with your friends or even for a couple 
Its restaurant style my love of BBQ and the restaurant staff earned this five star from us Our experience for the first time at Brasillia was fantastic we tried the NKK 585 C80per person all you can eat 14 type of meat BBQ  lamb sausages chorizo chicken pork beefetc they are all delicious and lamb and its pork ribs is our favorite they will give you a card that you can flip over for yes or stop serving to give you a break on the flow of bbq if you need serving of meats on your table the chef will walk around the restaurant bringing skewers of bbq and slices it on your plate they also have a buffet of side dishes salads and wonderful sauces to match your BBQ It was a great experience for us at Bergen Norway
Nice Rodizzio Restaurant ideal for friends or families For a Business dinner it is too loud The Buffet is small but fine you find the typically Brazilian starters and side dishes Then the meat comes directly to your table  I recommend to try the buffet but dont take much otherwise you will not achieve to taste all the meat types The reservations are for 2 hours but after the first 60 minutes you are more than satisfied The price is for a buffet in Norway OK
Pros Some very tasty meats and drinks Would 100 recommend the premium caipirinha So good  Cons Took a long time to get some meat My friend didnt get his beer until he was done eating No chance of tasting all the meats as you would expect when this is advertised
What an experience An absolute musteat spot for every diehard meat fan Decent service and atmosphere huge side buffet on its own  LARGE selection of various meats Spicy mojito is one of the best cocktails Ive had recently Whats there not to love 
Awesome Irish Pub Nice crowd and staff
The barman was like the baldy Tom cruise mixing cocktails Did the work of two men and very welcoming
A lowceiling pleasant atmosphere authentic looking Irish pub dead in the middle of Stavanger Went in vey tired after a full days hike for a couple of beers and left with a big smile on my face People seemed really friendly and relaxed and I felt like Ive been going there my whole life Loved it
Great pub atmosphere  Good selection of beers and a great place to watch sport
A bar you could easily get very comfortable in  Great chilledout atmosphere with a good selection of beers nice people and great location  Visited a couple of times when we shared in Stavenger
Great atmosphere nice bartender and good cold beer Stopped by while walking around and ended up there for a few hours playing bar games Definitely a nice diversion when your not from Norway
Very nice place I recommend it to visit
Brownish semiIrish pub with a couple of locals enjoying their Sunday afternoon beers Good Guinness
We had a such a great time in this place  I really recommend it my friends and I are in our mid 20s and early 30s and we enjoyed it a lot
We went here in the time the student were having their introduction week It was very nice to see so much coziness and fun with the student needed to do the assignments by the schools Furthermore the staff is very helpful and nice All together a very nice experience
If youre looking for the finest French Chablis and velvet chairs this isnt your place  But if youre into a spot of people watching in the sun tasty beverage in hand the Beverly is a great spot Its one of the best spots in Stavanger to sit and watch the foot traffic at the harbour and the cruise ships pulling in and out of port
The security here is very rude I followed all the rules waited in the line for 1 hour and 30 min i was not clearly drunk but the security here just kicked me out for no reason at all  I felt very disrespected and kicked out because i am clearly gay and have a very strong feeling that is the reason for me being kicked out Honestly the rudest security and hope that Beverly would change their security because honestly they are very harsh towards their customer for no reason at all
It was really the only place open as it was Bank Holiday Monday my mom was with us also and her name is Mary so was a fun visitthey had had a party the night before and we    had our feet sticking to the floor etc but added to the atmosphere 
Great pub very decorative and uniqueright in the port of Stavenger 
Lovely bar with a Nordic theme suits the aesthetic and atmosphere of a bubbling Norwegian town Stavanger has a few bars and pubs to visit this is certainly one of them
Great pub with friendly staff Great surroundings really good pricing for Norway only a tenner a pint lol
I really enjoyed the place It has unique and vibrant atmosphere Great choice of beers and other liquers Two floors the upper is open at 6 pm with own bars I recommend it 
If you love to taste beer this is the place to go They have an extensive beer menu with beer in various categories and they can also arrange beer tasting if you go there as a group The whole place looks like a typical British pub and there is a good atmosphere there at night Recommended especially if you are adventurous and want to taste many different types of beer
Great selection of craft beer and classics  A bit pricey and they dont serve any food From a beer and atmosphere perspective it is a five star option
Helpful and friendly barstaff guided me to just the right beer as close to a traditional maltl as possible Cozy space feels like a different period A good spot to hide from the rain No view but good tables for communal discussion
As food they have only plser hot dog and some snack but is a great place for drink beer and play games with friends Very interesting as after dinner place
Popped in for a coffee and snack Had a hot dog Tasty And the bar staff were friendly
I always seem to end up here I really enjoy the vibe and atmosphere of this place and they have a good variety of beer without this being the only available drink by far Good music and the vokume allows for conversations though in a Saturday night more one to one than group conversations
This is an amazing little pub tucked away in old Stavanger near the harbor Staff are friendly and helpful There is a large selection of local and Scandic beers on tap They have most everything else you could be looking for available in a bottle I would suggest allowing the bar keep to steer you towards a local brew they are varied and very very good Great outdoor seating area with a beautiful view of old Stavanger
Always a fun place to go out drinking with your friends You can dance on the tables to a beloved singalong type of music The Staff is nice and welcoming wearing Authentic Oktoberfest outfits Dirndl and Lederhosen Youll can expect great service from the waitresses and bartenders serving your shots on skis with fireworks you can also ask for the 4liter draftbeer on a self tap unit In my opinon the cocktails served here are great Ask your bartender for their recommendations
Dog water
Excellent evening enjoying Oktoberfest with beer and sausage Music could have been better  
Hi it was very fun and I met a lot of friends cheap Jger Bomb
Nice place to meet friends and enjoy a beer You may also order a pizza or a burger
Very cozy place great for weekend football Not super crowded like other sportsbars but chilled with a very friendly environment
Slow service bar tender couldnt serve in correct order Walked out because might as well give my money to a bar that knows what it is doing
Beste charming place for beer fotball good food and atmosphere in Stavanger Hidden Gem
Interesting place but the lady bartender does not fill glasses to the top as should be I had to argue with her to get the glass filled in to 05 l Will not go there anymore
This place has a few good local beers great cocktails and friendly staff Their free WiFi is fast and reliable and the ambiance is great There is a large terrace outside that fills up quickly and their decorations and art are unique and interesting
Super nicely decorated Very different and quite interesting if you pay attention to the details Good location as well right in the center at the cutest street But I went there for lunch and got really disappointed when I chose the quinoa salad and they just turned some plastic container over a bowl and gave me that Its the kind of thing you get at any supermarket or convenience store so definitely not expected at a caf
Best drinks good people good music We can talk drink and enjoy friends company
Nice place Mediocre drinks small and expensive Waiter a bit too overeager running around the bar with his credit card terminal Feeling a bit pushy
Owned by a talented gay musician with a wondrous sense of humour this is THE place to go if youre out to hang with the fringe crowd or just want to meet extraordinary people Everyone else is also welcome and the feeling of being right at home ensures its a place that fills up no matter what Be early if your desire outside seating Oh and youll dig the chandeliers
I really liked this little cozy place An amazing brownie and really nice hot chocolat
What a great experience to wbjoy a drink and lovely company in this lovely bar Thank you
Cool place lovely service The music was also on point Sad they close at 130am
Restaurant with Brazilian service in the heart of Stavanger I met in February 2023 with friends when we performed the flight simulator Wonderful service
Nice little place a bit out of the way But still quite popular One hidden gem is the food The Picanha Is just delicious Nice sortment of sides like the farofa feijoada and salsa Well worth the visit
A nice environment but a bit surprised by the price you pay and the amount food you getscampi is really just a very small tapas but price is like a dish Cocktails have limited selections in the end we get something improvised by waiter Waiter is nice lady from the kitchen is arrogant and unpleasant to interact with
Nice local bar in Stavanger Fisketorget area It shows premiere football
I am very much impressed by the quality of cleaning routines on the mens room Until now I had yet to experience a pee free surface in what youd call a 100 maleonly facility Good job blessed
A good English pub near the port of stavanger
Nice venue with lots of seating and helpful friendly staff
Cozy place wish there was more blues rock played
Standard bar A bit more rock going for it Used to be better But its nice and less mainstream than other bars Go early cuz its always full
This place has its own atmosphere Usually the music is really good the interior is a bit weird but it has its own charm
The best bar in Stavanger for live rock and metal Good selection of beersand good staff
Another great place I always seem to end up in when in Stavanger Always fun to visit
Wonderful atmosphere friendly staff
The beer has sour flavour and they simply say sorry cant help how it tastes  Ridiculous place ridiculous service
Good place to take a drink with a great shuffle board in the back  A place where a lot of the people har local regulars instead of tourist  They server Tou beer on tap
The food is delicious My girlfriend and I have eaten here twice during our one week stay in Stavanger My photos show a frokostsmoothie and Kofta kebab both served during the Gladmat festival  if its standard on the menu I dont know The first time we visited Finkel we ate rye bread with avocado  yum
Very friendly service and delicious salmon sandwich Recommended
I druk here norwegian beer Its expensive one but nice place
Good food dumb staff We had BLTs and coffee and found the food reasonably priced and yummy The staff ran around like chickens with their heads cut off  one coffee they delivered with no cream and sugar the next coffee had cream and sugar Then you either had to go in yourself for cream and sugar then theyd bring it out The lady brought our sandwiches didnt recognize us even though wed ordered from her just minutes before Another table had similar issues  we got a kick out of it Good ambience and the place has potential if the staff can figure out how to bring food out to tables 
Live music great service and great atmosphere They have tags which show their spoken languages as flags
Very cozy  i enjoyed a nice friday evening with friends over some live music  keep going guys  Friendly bartenders Great atmosphere
Not a great sound system horrible cumbersome chairs and possibly the rudest Norwegian guys Ive met since arriving who were taking videos of an allgirl group uninvited If you like salsa though worth a visitthe terrace outside is pleasant enough
I went into this place from the suggestion of a friend and completely fell in love with it Every person who worked there on a busy Friday night greeted me welcomed me checked in with me from the moment I walked in the door The cocktails are gorgeous On top of that the weekend cabaret show was phenomenal Not too loud but just setting the vibes for a perfect weekend It was awesome I loved every minute and this place is now one of my fave spots in Stavanger
Steak was good and very quiet and nice at a Monday night As expected Helpful staff not much waiting time
Friendly and unpretentious mixed crowd and good selection of food and drink Great outdoor area right next to the shopping street
Bar with some times live music Last night there was a good concert but no sound tech and a lot of feedback 
Brown style place Always well staffed and not to much waiting Very cramped in the weekends
Good vibes and good beer selection with the team knowing their knowledge  strange that your security refuse men at the door with shorts on in the summer though  maybe thats something you should change
I was looking forward to trying out Melkebaren after many good reviews Unfortunately we ordered Ink  Dagger on tap and got an Imperial IPA This is just not acceptable in a place like this The bartender was not interested in helping us either We ordered can to verify
The pub is nice Beer selection is pretty diverse
Excellent selection of beers in reasonable prices for Norway The best Guinness I ever drank The barmen are very helpful and know their beers very well There are chairs outside with a smoking area It really is a nice place although it is a little of the main path Which in my opinion is a plus
Enjoyed there and for sure Ill go there again when Im coming to Trondheim
Its hard to find an affordable watering hole in Trondheim The staff were very friendly and indulged us Americans in a little much needed small talk 110 Nok for a 6 of ol vs 180 Nok for a 4 at the posh diner
Great vibes and great people running the place Go to spot for a beer and pub meals
Very cool bar And theres pool upstairs
It is a bar with always a great atmosphere You can go watch a rugby match or probably any other spots match and drink something while you are at it There are also events like the Pub Quiz that are also very fun That said the food is cheap but bad even being cheap it made me sad to eat that burger you get what you pay I guess
Amazing Extremely hospitable to me and my daughter when we travelled to Trondheim Such a wonderful bunch of people Made us feel right at home Cant thank you enough Sarah was a delight with my daughter 5
Avoid this place at all cost if you are not Norwegian and have had any alcohol before coming This place hate foreigners Me and my girlfriend were not allowed to come in because we were to drunk We had had to beers to our dinner and not drunk at all In most countries you are even allowed to drive a car with to beers in your system
This place is great I am an American and wanted to watch NFL on a Sunday while in town The owner took me upstairs to a setup with sound where myself another American and a couple of local guys were able to watch on a big screen I did not eat but the guys next to me had fish and chips and said it was great
Went here after enjoying Johnathans Grill Needed some me time to get a nice drink with my lady friends Service was so nice Got a picture of my drink thankfully I would be happy to  go back
Absolutely wonderful experience from beginning to end Topnotch staff The service is better than you even know you needed and the drinks are finely crafted and help tell parts of the history of Trondheim Cant wait to come back
I loved it I can only recommend Drinking there is a life experience Dont judge me by reading this but you should definitely visit the toilets as well It is so fancy Oh by the way dress nice 
Just go Cocktails take you on a journey service is wonderful and the atmosphere is inviting and beautiful
Great atmosphere good knowledge of whiskies and other spirits I would recommend asking for advice and be surprised to try different things Good Aquavit is also stocked and dont leave without trying a glass
I keep coming back each time I am in Trondheim It has an excellent collection of Aquavit and many other liquors and beer Follow the recommendations of the bartender when ordering I have never been steered wrong
The staff made us feel like our visit there was an inconvenience to them Great selection in beers cocktails and whiskies
Good selection of whiskey and bottled beer The draft menu is poor through Good seating and nice athompshere Poor and small toilet area Service was just what you can expect friendly enough but nothing extra
Typical pub with Norwegian dishes and dards game
Try gulasjuppe D
Climbing adventures
Incredibly nice pub classic and delightful The service is as always outstanding and matches the food The goulash soup is highly recommended the meat soup is also delicious and is available in slightly larger portions Enjoy the food enjoy the atmosphere accept life lessons and have a slightly better day 
Cozy atmosphere and friendly bar staff There were a ton of board games available for borrowing and even a TV with some retro videogames  Had a selection of microbrews both on tap and in cans
Wonderful beer great music and a surprising selection of board games
Came down to a quiz I dont mind the quiz but the poster outside stated clearly rock and metal Did not get that Going to finish up my beer and head toward another place
I was visiting Trondheim and found this great bar Awesome music and even as a tourist I easily could make some new local friends  Beer was affordable considering general prices in Norway
Great place for football games and fantastic service
Where the locals go to catch the game and a beer
Its a sports bar but Ive never watched sports here Good atmosphere and nice personnel
Nice place with nice people Basse
Great service Awesome rock bar Chill and friendly bartenders
The vault cellar pub with the absolute greatest be yourself  come as you arefactor  Whether tourist or Tronndheimer I think everyone should have the pleasure of experiencing a live concert in such an amazing atmosphere  Rather impressive selection of beer bottled as well as on tap And last but not least A wonderful crew of employees Rolling a 7 on the dice here Check it
1010 would play Ixodes  Monolithian again and again and again Lovely how they allow music requests 
Great rock bar very underground feeling Had no idea there was a concert going on but got tickets anyway and loved Ingenium The headliner was not so much our cup of tea but thats no fault of the venue  Would go again
Live Music and a great jam session
Cozy place and good live music
This place has its own unic style smiling people dancing and good blues music
Great music a classic pub
Good music
Nice place with pleasant staff but it always smells remarkably bad in there I think there is a lack of exhaust fans in the toilets Almost always smells of urine throughout the room Really should have taken it because the space itself is relatively good
Oldfashioned arched cellar Can be perceived as a bit claustrophobic and cramped Distinct urine smell in the room Plus for shuffleboard
Fantastic place with top music and Irish coffee
Refreshing cocktails Overtly sweet for our taste Perhaps a classic margarita would relieve that next time pineapple punch was nice and bubbly lightly sour spicy margarita and the mint ginger tequila drink were both very very sweet
Worst experience ever Was not allowed to enter the place while it was half full and a slow day We six black friends were stopped and denied to come in they were letting inn every other person to enter Even tho they didnt say it directly we felt unaccepted with the excuse they said it was full they gave us I have had very fun experiences when I came with my Norwegian friends while it Was full of people to the door but today they ruined our night
Me and my girlfriend were trying to find a good place for drinks albeit a bit early in the evening The entrance is more like that of a restaurant and I immediately thought the place to be pretentious We were the only ones there its a cocktail bar and we have to wait to get seated We stood outside of the please wait to be seated sign for only a brief moment before a waitress escorted us to a table We were practically the only guests but the waitress filled the room with enthusiasm Im a sucker for knowledge I really dont need so when she began the saga of how they make the Claro Colada I was sold And soon enough the whole place were packed and our wallets were empty We ended up trying almost every drink on the menu with the Claro Colada being a favorite for both of us Rounded off the evening with a 10 year Sazerac and a smile The relationship endedI miss u babe pls come back but the memories remain 55 would buy every item again
Awesome cocktails They put a lot of work in the cocktails By far the best in Trondheim
This is one of my favorite pubs in Trondheim  Situated on the old Town Bridge over the Nidelva River  it makes you experience the authentic feeling of the interior of old river houses  The taps are not super thrilling  but the environment definitely makes up for that  Last Time I was  there during the Ale Festival so I could taste some pretty interesting beers and ales from local breweries  so definitely a great experience
The place is really cozy and the layout reminds you of a modern but at the same time old ancient bar They have sitting places on a dock outside during summer Its really nice Prices are on average the same as other places in the city and they also have reduced prices for students
They know their job The service is very helpful and can advise on your drink The selection of beers is very nice local international and krafts And then there is a unique atmosphere whether it is a wooden inside or an outside wobbling barge
A good place to spend your Friday night with friends This place is just near the best spot in town  gamle Bybro
Refurbished but still centered around darts and alcohol Mostly regulars and you can get drunk here without being harassed by the staff
Good services 
Relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff

Patricks Pub Kristiansand Norway  012023  022023 052022  062022  Places inside and outside seats   Good place where you can eat good food or drink water wine beer  Friendly personal quick to bring ordered drinks  Eating also littel later 2000 possible  Kitchen closed 2130  Burger and also spareribs are very delicious and tasty  Not so loud music so you can talk inside  Places ouside you can seat under heater and or with blankets  Nice place  Price ok
Wonderful experience eating and drinking  pleasant staff able to suit my requirements
Went for the beerselection but was very positively suprised over the food and very impressed by the crew Staff greeted us with a friendly face behind facemasks wich everyone wore All throughout our visit the employees constantly checked in on us gave recommendations on food and beer  Kudos We had crispy chicken tacos as a starter It was crisp had spicy flavours and was very juicy As a main we had the Penne Louisianna a creamy and spicy pastadish I canot fault this place for anything very good experience
Came all the way from Austria for the best burger in krsand definitely worth it  Super food and super service
Quiet when we were there at 2pm Saturday in March little bar Has the English premiership football on the TV Clean and tidy Barman was polite and spoke fluent English
Nice not so expensive pub
Very nice
Great bar we meet all our friends there
The cops stay away from this place Its anarchy
Great beer great people
Lovely
Best
They dont allow foreigners into this place
Plays the same music alot but still fun music
U u u y y
Very Nice spot

Was here for music bingo Great atmosphere and a very nice bingo host The clientele was a bit young as I am 40 but I really enjoyed myself Will probably come back and try my luck one more time 
Very pleasant place Always fun with karaoke and good hosts who manage the show
Best karaoke bar in town Tuesdays even start the day with NOK 35 beer Totally crazy Diggers sailors
Friendly staff good sized dancefloor and TVs for football
Very nice atmosphere amd good drinks There is often live music
Love this place come play billiards and enjoy
Play games drink beer chill out dance around All Inn
Its pub where u can enjoy on weekendsmainly youth
They have a fantastic meat patty with exciting toppings its the cities best burger in my opinion and according to many others as they keep winning the title  Sadly its a sports bar which means its hard to have a conversation if theres a game on TV When you pay make sure to ask for the Burger Card so you can get the 6th burger for free
Good for when you want to spend some teenage fun time with your friends Amazing part is the free games every friday Recommend it if you want to go to a barrestaurant with stuff to do all around you
Food was great Lovely burger large portion size Liked the sports bar style Staff were polite and helpful Spoke English good thanks Highly recommended for a bite to eat and a beer or two
Javel Pub Kristiansand Norway   062022  One of the last good pubs in Kristiansand where you can go for over 40 years old  Karaoke singing is announced so very fun who likes it From very good singers to those who never will  The pub is always well filled sometimes a bit noisy but   Friendly staff although it is very stressful for the ladies  gentlemen at the bar   The security ladies are very attentive All drinks that are available are served  I think highly recommended  Price ok
Lovely overall atmosphere nice and friendly staff Im taking a star off for the fact that I expected more rock in the karaoke part of the evening
Visited the place on Friday evening Its FUN The karaoke was really fun to watch and there were some really good ones The guy who worked there had a good talent  The other good thing is that they have quality drinks Thx for the experience
Nice smal rocker pub Kareoke on Thursdays and lots of other fun activities such as pub quiz and more
The fish  fried is delicious Unfortunately I forgot to take the takeout half of the fish  fried since the waitress collected it and did not bring back the bag of food
Amazing food and fresh fish Friendly service  although one man show We can absolutely recommend this restaurant which is directly located at the fish market
The food looks good and tastes alright however the service is terrible and the prices are ludicrous  We had bread with shrimps and a hit chocolate as well as a fish soup with a coke 02 For each meal we paid around 250300 Krona so 25 to 30 Euros without tip For this price one should get a good meal which leaves nothing to be desired The cream on the hot chocolate had gone bad The soup came cold probably forgot to put it in the microwave after taking it out of the container The shrimp decoration was still frozen After we had to ask the waiter twice to improve the quality cream and cold soup not once did she try to offer us anything complimentary to make up for the obvious mistakes She didnt offer blankets or to turn on the heater either  The soup tasted alright The amount of fish inside wasnt that big There were lots of carrots though The taste was alright but not very strong The bread my colleague had was good but then again the mayo was served separately in a plastic pouch like from McDonalds This isnt resembling the big price and also doesnt make sense How are you supposed to put it onto the stacked bread and still eat it comfortably  Overall we werent really satisfied and would not recommend going there again
Very friendly service and delicious food and seafood dishes And what I really didnt expect They also have pretty decent cocktails If I ever visit Kristiansand again this restaurant will be my first stop
I would have to say that it depends on what room you get Its really a huge difference with that And you would think that it would be much warmer in the rooms instead of so cold And I am not a little man but if I was any bigger I would not be able to fit in the bathroom Room 224 if you get that room ask for a different one  other than that its a wonderful beautiful place Very nice folks
Heart of Kristiansand next to the best pubclub in kristiansand Old Irish Pub is where you get live music and a DJ to party the night away Very friendly receptionist that looked after me when I had a problem with the tv had a conference call and needed a tv with HDMI connection he moved me to another room and I didnt miss the call bar a few minutes Really helpful and friendly staff and amazing rooms you would expect to find at the Clarion
AC says its on but its not very hot in the rooms Hallways smell bad carpets are beat up and the bathrooms have automatic lights that never turn off Its also surrounded by noisy bars
Probably the worst and smallest hotel room I have ever had the displeasure of staving in The view to the lobby was mediocre  Breakfast ok until they started taking the food away 15 minutes before closing time
Very intimate small pub Feels weirdly British but quite few years ago Good beer
Traditional pub great service Roof terrace as highlight Great location
very nice
Currently closed due to Covid19 lockdown Its been open for over 50 years so it will open again
I would have to say that on my trip here to Norway  I have not gone to many bars I did not have a drink However serving speed and accuracy of my friends orders were great
Went here twice with my boyfriend and his friends I really like the ambience and not too crowded when i visit I ordered rum strawberrywatermelon cocktail and it was super good
Cool pub with English speaking employees usually a wide age range during the evenings Serves a couple of different Glutenfree beers
The best Irish pub in town Newly refurbished Extremely friendly staff Wide range of beers
Its a tiny intimate beer pub They also have a decent selection of gin  tonics and gin cocktails House recipes Eleven different beers on tap and plenty of beers on bottle and some ciders
Dark bar with a well executed steampunk theme Music can be varied at some times as they play mostly anything of requests However the usual genre would be rock metal  They have a great assortment of beers However not as big on mixed drinks and cocktails But do try one of their gindrinks if youre a happy ginaholic
Honestly the best pub in Drammen its not too much people here so youll be able to breathe The interior and theme of this pub is amazing the drinks are the best I like how its kind of hidden too This is my goto pub in Drammen
Best service you can ever have
Very good placetry everyone
Very friendly staff let me charge my phone there and were very helpful and friendly Good place to see football eat some pub grub and play pool Close to the local football stadium
Probably the best sports bar in Drammen
Socially sporty and entertaining place with the best pizza ever
The place was empty except for a table with girls but I was told they were full so the doorman let in several scantily clad girls while I wasnt allowed I feel discriminated against Dont go back
Rip off on drinks etc good she in the bar was pretty to look at NOT GOOD
Small and cozy place Decent price The doormen are pleasant and provide proper service
Great place good service pleasant staff
Super nice place relax and enjoy alone or with your friends 
up there when it comes to prices compared to same spots in Drammen but homely atmosphere and the only place where you can get a topped Bayer a local pilsner topped with Bayer to get a unique flavour for an affordable price Great for football matches especially local
Perfect place to drink beer and watch football  
This place left me speechless Its brilliant 
Only bar in the centre having that big craft beers selection They have a nice cocktail menu as well U can always ask a bartender to get recommendations on beer or if U just cant decide what kind of cocktail is for You they are very helpful
With Roli as a new boss of Pavarotti the place will Bloom and attract customers with their delicious and home made food kolbasaspolse made entirely by Roli are to die for and so are all of his smoked dishes The other day he made a potato stew with smoked carrots with oyster mushrooms for our 2 year old son and he ate the entire thing First time ever Ive heard his say that he is full but he wanta more Ooh and the deserts Simple but delicious Go eat and try it for yourself
One of the worst cocktails Ive ever had was served at Pavarotti Otherwise the place is in dire need of a thorough scrub down and renovation Tip avoid this place and visit a clean professional bar instead
A very cozy and intimate pub located in the heart of Drammen Barkeepers are profesional experienced and most of all nice  They have a large assortment of beer and what i would say the best assortment of whiskey rum and cognac in the city If youre in for trying something new or extraordinary this is the place  If youre more in the mood for mixed cocktails and longdrinks I can promise you you wont get dissapointed with the quality and advice youll get from the bar keepers here
Really really good tapas for a fair price This place is way to cheap for its amazing food This is a hidden perl of Drammen The chervre with honey was amazing
Lovely and tasty tapas and descent prices  Recommended to preorder table  Had to wait a bit to pay while we had empty glasses and table was a full house so its understandably
Great food together with an exceptional service made this a great evening 5 star no doubt 
Food was really really good for a fair price Staff were really nice Had to wait at the bar for a table not a problem but a local runt that was clearly known to the staff got territorial and obnoxious maybe because Im not from Norway Need to stop people like this hanging round the bar spoiling your reputation Other than that great place but did kind of ruin the experience
Skjenkestua as is a very nice place where you can get a good meal or very good beer from the locale Aass Bryggeri and several other drinks in a very cosy atmosphere it is a backyard you can use in the summer and in the wintertime indoors I will recommend this very special place from the bottom of my heart The house where the restaurantpub is in its one of the oldest house in the town of Drammen CheersSKL
Traditional Norwegian restaurant with typical dishes from all parts of Norway Highly recommend
Drammens oldest pub Rustic place providing generous helpings of traditional Norwegian food Good place for a beer and a pub meal
V nice food Portions bigger than they appear



The place to be
We were present at Nini nightclub on Saturday night and we witnessed a disturbing incident unfolding behind us One of the clubs guards treated a guest in a very disrespectful manner It was clear that the guest was discriminated against and that power was abused in this situation  It was sad to see that the guest could not say anything without risking being kicked out We heard the guards claims and accusations that the guest had obviously never made and it seemed as if the guard had already decided to remove that person regardless of what was said  We believe that it is important that such incidents are taken seriously by the clubs management and that they ensure that they have professional and respectful staff It is crucial that nightclubs like Nini maintain a safe and inclusive atmosphere for all their guests and we hope that similar situations can be avoided in the future
I visited Nini Beach nightclub on Saturday 28102023 and unfortunately the experience was far from satisfactory Although I had been looking forward to a fun evening the joy was quickly overshadowed by an unpleasant episode with one of the guards  The guard I came into contact with showed a lack of professionalism and respect I felt discriminated against and power abused in their interaction with me It was a situation where I didnt dare to speak out as it seemed that the guard had already decided to throw me out no matter what I said  To make matters worse the guard made claims and accusations I had never made and any attempt to explain myself resulted in me being asked to leave the premises This negative experience ruined my entire evening and I have no plans to visit a nightclub with such low standards and lack of professionalism in the future It is important that such establishments take responsibility for their employees and ensure a safe and respectful atmosphere for all guests
the club is perfectly fine but the one waiter who worked there was incredibly good so it gets 5 stars
Best of all the Irish bars in Amsterdam Not that says a lot as most of them are awful Best thing is the staff and the beer is ok
The Irish atmosphere can be felt in this place The service is very good If for the amount of alcohol you drink you need to eat something light the owner is very tolerant if you bring something bought in another place like pizza or snacks Second visit in 6 months we will come back every time we are in Amsterdam
Lovely atmosphere and as a solo traveller felt safe amd even got talkimg to locals abd other travellers Lovely Rosie Joanne and Lee 
Great music selection and atmosphere the pub is situated in a nice location close to central station  We came here to have some drinks before going to a party in Noord price was okay but the cocktails we ordered tasted quite similar very very sweet However I would definitely come back for a beer 
Lovely vibes This Pub has that family feeling excellent customer service the bar staff are Great made me feel very welcome Will be coming back thank you X
Not warm as we could expect from an Irish pub as doors were maintained open on the streets from both side  Good atmosphere could have been even better if one of the barman was more focused on filling our empty glasses instead of removing it in any occasion  We would have appreciated rugby game with live comments seems obvious
Very funny place I had been there for beer and shots all of course of Guinness brand It was so tasty I would like visit this place again It was full of people Staff were very friendly
Overpriced  beer was not pleasant People smoking in the bar Stairs to toilets were a death trap  Wasnt somewhere Ill be racing back to
Great location friendly staff comfy seats and good people watching We had the cheeseburger and cheese chicken sandwich Not a fan of the cheeseburger English breakfast looked good may want to try that next time
Fantastic bar in the heart of Amsterdam we lived watching the rugby here The staff were really friendly 
Good atmosphere Great food We had nachos and fries between 2 of us and the beer was excellent too Staff were very nice and allowed me to charge my phone while I was there Didnt try the Guiness but the pints I saw looked fine
Pleasant wee Irish bar thats in a great location We got off the tram for the Heineken Experience with some time to kill and this bar was perfect for chilling before our booked time slot Very reasonable pricing for good sized portions and clean perfectly chilled draught beer One of the top 3 comfiest booths Ive ever enjoyed a pint in
Cozy atmosphere Irish pub very nice beers Yet the bar next to it open the music quite loud so you gonna hear 2 different things playing at the same time 
Staff is lazy You have to go order inside even  when the bar and terrace are empty Beer is great Once they tried scammed us  i think he just could not count
Decent bar perfectly located with good friendly service
Pint was flat no atmosphere Wouldnt return
Located in a highfoot traffic area but right on the canal with seating facing it and the street The restaurant was busy so the servers were definitely overwhelmed but did their best to stay on top of things  The draft Guinness was delicious and the burger was also good
Awesome While in Amsterdam we had to sniff out somewhere selling a fry up this seemed to be the best close place Came here twice once for a breakfast and then came back for a Guinness both were spot on  Amazing view of the canal too if you eat outside  Would absolutely return
Wonderful place Cleancozy with friendly and polite staff The best Irish coffee i had ever
The Aran Irish Pub was such a lovely stop on our trip We dropped in early for some breakfast and were blessed with the good weather to eat outside The terrace is a lovely place with a great atmosphere I could have stayed and sat watching the boats on the canal all day Our server was very attentive and served us with a lovely friendly smile The manager Davide was incredibly helpful fun and pleasant Our breakfast was gorgeous and later on in the day I recommend getting the stew it was very tasty Only thing Id say is be careful on the bathroom stairs after a few pints
We went there for breakfast this morning and couldnt fault the service food and drinks We had full Irish breakfast and it was great The coffee was tasty and the service was great staff were friendly and were very welcoming Would highly recommend
Great sunday roast and appel pie Fantastic atmosphere I also recomend the full irish breakfast Best irish pub in amsterdam
Great place for drinks Great atmosphere and heated terrace Staff is very attentive and welcoming Didnt have any food there so cant comment on that
Friendly service nice atmosphere We always visit here when we come to Amsterdam Good breakfast or evening meal Sport on TVs but  not intrusive  cracking music on in morning Lots of seating inside and out
Thanks for the Big Beer the Underbergs and your great Spareribs next time when im in Amsterdam i gonna show up again Youve gotta nice place to relax typical Kneipenculture best place 
Brilliantgreat musicfriendly staff and excellent drink selsctionindoor smoking area too
Nice place if you are looking for just a drink  No food is served but they let you bring food in
Great pub in Amsterdam great atmosphere great location for Amsterdam central station Freindly staff
Irish bars are meant to have nice beer and friendly Staff  This had neither  charging a fortune for horrific tasting beer  Had to be the worst pint in about ten years
Didnt have anything to eat but looked very clean  Well worth a visit Only a 10min walk from Amsterdam central
Came here each day I was in Amsterdam this week Great lil place to sit drink a beer and watch the world go by Great music and friendly staff Thank you 
Nice enough Irish pub abroad but we went to watch the rugby and its not really set up for that A bit weird watching a World Cup semi final with no sound but with the Back Street Boys or 70s disco classics getting churned out in the background If you want to watch sport Id go elsewhere but the Guinness was decent and staff friendly and helpful
Wow I have been many times in Amsterdam by far this is the best place that I ate dinner in The food was very good and fresh and tasty of course The cheesecake is out of this world You have to try them
We had an 8 pm dinner reservation at a different place and needed a quick drink before hand  Guinness tasted very fresh
Came in and sat outside around 4pm on a Saturday It was busy and you seat yourself The servers were nice and attentive once they noticed you were there There are several other restaurants nearby with outdoor seating as well so it was a bit loud Only had some snacks and they arrived hot and tasted great
The food was okay and the stuff was friendly However a WC was small and smelly It is located in the basement I have injured foot and it was difficult for me to get there A hand dryer was not working
Fish and chips is amazing Their steak sauce is also amazing Lots of beer to choose Not many staffs but they were really taking good care of customers When I visited there was one cute  black cat and he seems like a regular
A wonderful bar with cosy interior and pints of good beer We tried the steak pie and the sausages both were great The portions are very generous too
Highly recommend I appreciate their fast friendly service  waiter was very helpful and smiling that is important not even 2 minutes after drinks order they came out Food was great too  service was excellent Enjoyed the time Ive had in old bell restaurant Thanks
I was there last year and the food was delicious so i decided to visit old bell this year to and it was totally delicious Big portions nice staff and lot of local beer  I tried the steak and it was 1010 For me the bell is one of the top restaurants in AMS also with nice staff and location
Simply the best place to go  Great ambient  speciale when you travelling a lot And forget the lounge no steak in the lounge  Nice steak  Great mushrooms with onion small tasty salad and great big fries  And all on a good temperature  This you hardly find in any airport   Only one thing  Just one thing and so important   Every restaurant that serve knows  Have a sharp original Steak knife  The meat was not that bad  not really nice tender  But I would be much better by just giving a real sharp knife  The good thing is  I did burn some calories just by cutting it  And maybe the idea about this all  needed to get an extra wine for sure when at schiphol give it a go take your own knife cheers
Emirates lounge was closed for renovations so came here for an authentic Irish meal Birds Moretti pint beers 795 were the best part of the meal  Fish and Chips 2350 frozen fish and greasy chips BLT burger 2250 was dry not much bacon and minimal tomatoes   Prices are in Euro  Pub was a nice and quiet hideaway down the end of terminal D towards the end at Schipol airport To be honest probably not the worst you could do at an airport these days but certainly not amazing
The only airport with a real pub feel Staff are friendly and have good banter with the customers Food is good only downside is overpriced but thats standard for an airport Its normally relatively quiet and I would say better than the lounge
Great place to get out of the bustle of the airport We had breakfast food the fried egg with bacon on a bap and the fried egg with sausage on a bap We also tried the bitterballs  which were very good but very hot Also the booth areas have charging ports which was great Our waitress was very prompt but never returned with the check I think it is just how the restaurant works so we paid up front when we were ready to leave
Beautiful canal outdoor seating area aswell as inside food top notch and such friendly atmosphere and staff were great crack live music and all 
I was really excited to come here for some Irish comfort food Apparently I looked too far back on reviews because they dont offer a full menu anymore But no worries they have a large selection of bar bites you can get to snack on I got there before the game started so had no trouble finding a small table Once people started coming in it definitely filled in quickly I would definitely come here again just not when Im hungry for dinner
This Irish pub is just perfect for celebrating St Pats Day but also to enjoy a Guinness Was fully packed but totally worth it Second year celebrating Sain Patricks Day this time with a live band and good music Definitely recommend it 
An amazing pub We really enjoyed the food and beer
I cant say it was a bad experience But nothing like awesome Place itself is OK Pretty clean Nice stuff The sleeping space is very well organized There is light electric socket just 1  good air conditioning But doors with such a heavy lock that after closing it sounds like the Gates of Hell But this is Amsterdam where people party and go home all night long  2am 5am 10 different people in the room So after all this crazy noise you will hardly be able to get any good sleep
Amazing hostel in the middle of Amsterdam Everything is in walking distance The people working there are the most approachable people Ive met in Amsterdam Jalal nicely reminded me that towels are only charged once even though I wished to pay him for a cage of towels  Remote working is supported with a small area near the entrance but expect colder weather and some noise Facilities are very clean but I used one shower that had poor water pressure The beds are comfortable the rooms adequately warm Ill have this place in mind for my second visit
Dont let the name or location fool you this is an impressive high quality and organized hostel not to mention the staff is friendly and they provide excellent service and conversation if you like  I had two nights booked and ended up extending for 6 nights The place was cleaned and washed from top to bottom every single day between checkout and check in the bedding was hotel high quality and I slept so well each night for the whole week Earplugs are free towels provided for a cheap depositprice and in the capsule bed there is a socket and night light The rooms are quiet and lights are motion activated plus AC so I slept very well The showers and bathrooms are plentiful and large and kept very clean daily  Plus the location Youre in the heart of the beautiful city of Amsterdam and yet you hear nothing of it from the inside of the hostel Rules and policies are kept in place and all guests have their fun and come here to rest or socialize at the bar if anything discounted drinks and live music are provided there as well as a breakfast deal at Spar down the street  Special shout outs to Romina for helping me store my luggage and sharing local Argentinian recommendations and just being all around nice and elegant during busy times Milan for helping me extend my stay at a great price and to Peter and David for making me feel welcome from the beginning and to the guy who was from my same neighborhood back in Miami who helped with storage too  Everyone and everything was so great at Durty Nellys perhaps the best hostel Ive ever stayed at Book this place
Great experience overall The position is great central and easily accessible The whole staff was extremely kind and helpful the shared room and the bathrooms were really comfortable and clean especially considering its an hostel  The only thing a bit annoying was the noise coming out of the street but its absolutely not a fault of the structure since its located in the heart of the city center nightlife Plus they give you free earplug for the noise so they take care of that too
we were six and ordered 6 different kinds of food All were just perfect
It really wasnt tasty really ridiculous for that price ridiculous how bad it was

Such a great atmosphere live music in the ears while watching a good game of rugby Drinks slightly more expensive than hoped but Id happily pay it because of how great the place is
Friendly and fun staff the music was live and open meaning my pa got to join in great stuff
Very very nice Super cozy atmosphere The live music was lovely and set the tone as soon as we stepped in Coming in from the outside it felt like we had set foot into a tavern in a Game
Amazing atmosphere The Guinness pint there was something close to perfection
Food was absolutely delicious Staff were attentive and efficient
Weve been twice and intend to return Fedor waiter was very friendly and attentive to us
Step into Euro Bar where every visit is a dance with delight Tamas the bar maestro serves drinks with such precision and speed its a spectacle The relaxed atmosphere makes it a goto place Been here twice in the last 24 hours Thats a winning move
The worst service ever The staff was fighting among themselves with the clients and when you asked for something they were incredibly rude The food never arrived and the drinks were ok When we asked for the check the woman told us I could be faster if I had an extra pair of hands Ill never go back to that place
Great little bar Newcastle United themed and put the match on when we asked  Super friendly staff  owners definitely recommend even if youre not a Newcastle fan
cosy caf nice and friendly service I took an organic tripel from brouwerij t IJ 8 alcohol for 450 well actually 9 for two bottles as the atmosphere made me drink another one All in all a nice place where people look at and follow sports on the screens or play darts or have a chat and a laugh in real time in the familiarity atmosphere at the bar or trying ones luck at one of the one armed bandit machines who since long lost their one arm to a button surely to easier play the game of luck Outside youll find a terrace and enough tables to seat
Barman was very rude IPA BEER was served in a soapy glass He would not change the beer We left fairly sharpish
Just fine for a little late night drink on the way home
Great bar if looking for fun vibes great music that u can actually hear unlike bars around it down the street and stiff drinks Best dive bar in town with cool staff and even a bar mascot Highly recommend
Great place to have an early beer warm atmosphere and the owner is super friendly and his beer recommendations are to be trusted Highly recommend
Amazing vibrant bar with such lovely staff including the cutest dog This place was so great we made this place our local during our stay Ted the owner  Nadia were very welcoming  we had great fun with them during karaoke nights We didnt want to leave  We will be back soon to see you guys Pete  Claire Now Mr  Mrs CLARK
The Alibi is always our go to pub for weekday or weekend drinks Teddy is always good fun and Nadia is a true pro behind the bar Nala is the main attraction and is always open to a few head scratches  Great drinks Great vibe Great people
Nice place A lot fancier than many real British pubs but thats fine They were playing the football and one of the TVs was out of sync which some of the customers were not very happy about We didnt really mind but we did have to swap places with one of the groups Most of the customers were also British
This is by far the worst pub Ive ever been to in Amsterdam  Despite visiting Amsterdam several times a year for over a decade this was the first and last time Ill be stepping foot in this pub The bar man was an absolute bell Horrible and rude from the minute we walked in He had an English  cockney accent and the face of a fermented gherkin  I ordered half a pint because I was steaming already and he started going on about how nobody orders a half whats up with you not in a joking friendly way but with a look of anger on his pickled face He goes on and on and on about it despite nobody thinking he was funny at all  After spending 5 minutes too long here I decided to have a pint in the next pub  Amsterdam is a beautiful city with some amazing pubs bars and restaurants with welcoming happy staff This is not one of them dont waste your time here  Avoid
I went once and it was decent infact had the cheapest pint I came across while being in Amsterdam  However all 3 days I have tried to visit since they have been shut early even as early as 630pm so u have to give 1 star
Very dissatisfied and one of the worst meals ever They were out of tartare sauce or even mustard and did not bother to inform us when we ordered fish and chips very unapologetic later One of the fish was brown and burnt they replaced it but it had absolutely no seasoning The strangest was when they refused to bring us Tabasco as it was only for the bar and said no to empty glasses as we had our own water and said we had to buy water from them to get glasses not the Best customer service and not a cheap place either
This is a very nice place in Rotterdam I have been here before a couple of times They usually have a free spot and the interior design is fabulous Love the fact that the waiter kept calling me darling Felt like being in England I had a very good fish and chips here but I am going to be brutally honest it is more a Dutch version of the dish The fish is small yet enough for a small man like me  flavour is good and sauce is great they are not garden peas and they dont do mushy peas and the chips are Dutch ones lovely though and seemed fresh and not frozen Overall probably the best fish and chips you can get around here The Ginger Beer they serve is not one commonly found at cafs The taste is really good but maybe not as hot as the label claims Visit this spot enjoy the food and drinks and you will probably want to come back for more
The staff are so nice and they have glhwine  Even if its not on the menu
What a messed up place Terrible service Arrogant and totally useless waiters No interest in trying to fix what they screwed up When you dont know who ordered which dish and just throw it on the table Considering the service and the level of the staff it was probably a good thing that I didnt get the food and taste it Stay away if you want something called service
It was fantastic People workers food so amazing Thank you all very much Its our favorite restaurant in Rotterdam Enjoy
Brilliant for watching football and rugby  Food was adequate and beer very nice  Good atmosphere
A bit male majority type of atmosphere of course if you are there to watch a match and get some drinks at the same time its a great cozy spot Dont forget to try their nachos to go with
Friendly and welcoming service We really enjoyed the mixed meat nachos accompanied with several beers on the terrace while watching the world go by The beer tasted fresh and crisp too
Great food maybe A BIT expensive but worth buying especially due to wonderful vibe of the place In my opinion its the best place to watch f1 in rotterdam outside your home
Great staff Great beer  
Great ambient Good beverages Nice people
Simple bar provides all that you need from a locals bar
Great place great atmosphere super service doesnt get much better
This legendary caf serves a great selection of beers and some wine as well as snacks The owners are absolutely charming and friendly A perfect way to spend a couple of hours enjoying the stunning view of the river and the Willemsbrug the iconic red bridge
Really good home bar  Beer costs less than in the city
Not bad place the view is pretty and there are not many places around that area However is a very Dutch place sort of oldgrumpy Okay for a short pitstop or if you are around and you wish to rest
It happened to be there on a warm sunny morning so this excellent place with that beautiful view reminded me the nice time I had back in my home country Greece
Great music Good beers and wines Nice and friendly staff and atmosphere Great live music
Nice cozy place to have a pleasant weekend The voice of the singer is such a blessing to the ears
Was here a few times And definitely will go again Very big choice of beers and tasty snacks Usually they have enough different types of draft beer But if you will not find draft beer that you like waiter will give you big book with all kinds of beer in bottle Jazz bands are just amazing every time Atmosphere is awesome Definitely worth to visit
Excellent Jazz Music from Dano Roelvink Great nightand large variety of beers
Great beer brewed onsite The pub is in the style of an English pub Its certainly 110
zeroregrets on the nachos and beer  Some things are worth every last calorie   Update after eating more of the Fiddlers nachos I think they must have the best nachos in all of Europe 
Lovely IrishEnglish themed bar good selection of beer and cider very nice seating area outside too Food I dont really recommend had better burgers and fish n chips in my life tasted fast foodish like it was done from frozen products but good place for drinksparty
Nice pub with different beers snacks and what more important sports games in live format As dutch are not big fans of ice hockey we were pleased to find a place to watch a live game The atmosphere here and surroundings are also very nice Food is okay so you can order something here to eat with no worries
We had a reservation for dinner through the website but when we arrived there was plenty of room so we opted for a bar high top table for the pub vibe with the football match playing A few loud patrons singing but hey its a pub so to be expected The barwoman was great very attentive and the food was very good Separately I would rate the food 45 but all factors considered the pub was a 55
Very cool pub with great music and nice atmosphere great for spending the evening for some drinks or pub food The beer selection is quite vast as well as the choices for food I absolutely suggest the sweet potato fries with parmesan on top really delicious The staff was also super friendly despite the large amount of customers  to be served and they helped us choosing a whiskey since we are not experts at all It would help to have a whiskey menu though
Amazing place Great entourage fantastic service the food is oh my gosh I dont even have words God Bless the chefs brilliant music We had the best night Definately coming back
One of the best places in town  Best slow cook ribs Ive ever had the meat quite literally fall of the bones Drinks are amazing with very good pricing Highly recommend for a date night or just having a few pints with the friends
Top irish pub
Nice pub to go out
Cozy and above all a very hospitable pub
Always fun there  a lot of choice from various types of beer Was great again there really nice place for Friday afternoon drinks
Really like this place very friendly and welcoming I enjoyed the background music There is a good choice of beers in various strengths and prices
Great food drinks and atmosphere  Rachelle the bartender is the best and Alan the owner is often there to great you personally  Wonderful place to eat or just enjoy some drinks with friends Great for English and Dutch speakers
Proper English pub with pints English grub and easy parking in streets nearby Great music great team great beer and great food Thoroughly recommend for expats and locals alike
Nice English pub in old rijswijk Good atmosphereexcellent choice of salesbeers and cider Typical pub food piesfish and chips and grills Good value
Very nice and cozy sports bar They play the important games and the bartenders are attentive and friendly
This is a great bar staff music style Suits me
Awesome bar great music friendly staff and locals Wide range of beers and good prices as well When in The Hague visit Ned Kellys few bars are authentic like this one
Great service feels like coming home to your second family
I love the food really so good  thanks to Debora and the chief everything was lovely
Great atmosphere and super friendly folks Reminds me of the place where everybody knows your name And that Korean chicken was just like in Seoul
Fantastic local bar that welcomes both locals and expat brits longing for an authentic UK pub Friendly staff good food and a well stocked bar What else can you ask for
Very friendly warm staff They have a fun trivia night every now and then too I love the steak and onion pie
Always nice to go bowling but the place is suffering from insufficient staff No one and no signage for registering no menus out was served spoiled guacamole and then our game was shut down at 53 minutes instead of 55 minutes and even though there was no one after us
Went for drinks and pool but we left early because of the horrible and unfriendly service The pool table is expensive which I wouldnt complain about if I actually received what I payed for It was 1750 for an hour but we got kicked away from the table after 40 minutes and the member of staff had the audacity to say we were over time to stop directly and leave the stuff on the table for the next customers I dont mind paying alot but at a bare minimum you should get what you pay for and be treated politely by the staff We left straight away to have drinks somewhere else
I went there many times already The place atmosphere food and service overall great It is a suitable option for a birthday party  bowling arcade karaoke pool or for just going out and have dinner
We had a lovely night out going bowling and then enjoying dinner at the restaurant The bowling alley was quite nice albeit a bit small if theres 2 bigger groups at the same boot Dinner was delicious and staff was friendly and able to take our dietary wishes into account  thank you so much The only downside of our experience was that the sauces for fries were quite empty the garlic bread was not that garlicy  we had to ask for cutlery and napkins with our food  All in all we definitely recommend going here And if youre not a fan of bowling theres plenty of other activities to enjoy while there   We ordered chefs dessert strawberry milkshake nice taste creamy tequila shots with lime  salt ice tea beer white wine spare ribs very juicy and tasty chicken burger beef tenderloin nicely raremedium
Nice
Amazing oldies music relatively cheap priced drinks for city centre standards and super close to the train station Theres also a pool table and some games you can play Highly recommend
Paddys from Always Sunny We went to LA to see it because our son was a fan He did a kick flip off the curb It was pretty cool but he ended up twisting his ankle with the skateboard we got at a shop at Santa Monica beach shop where the kids think they saw James Franco  This is all irrelevant to the pub but you can tell the story to the bartender because the odds are you will have opulent opportunities
At the time of posting Jims has been open for 6 months Here we have a young entrepreneur who wants to do something a little different in the Hague If your British give Jim your support  If you are any other nationality give them your support and enjoy a good beer and company
If you know the right days of the week this place is always packed with students and a great time Drinks are relatively cheap bartenders are excellent and has a really fun atmosphere Hands down favorite pub in the hague
Great neighborhood hangout with a super friendly and charming owner who made some offmenu cocktails for my wife and I Will certainly go back when in The Hague
Very nice Bar with such an amazing host Marshall Was very open minded and taught us a lot about the living in scheveningen Billard Was free to use also But the most important thing  the beer was delicious
Super service and great atmosphere great place to enjoy some nice beers
Great atmosphere in this small but beautiful bar Barkeeper Marshall was very openminded and spreads a lot of fun and good vibes 100100 coming back here
Unfortunately I did not like the service There was no waiter outside nor did anyone came to take our order This is very unfortunate A missed opportunity The atmosphere is also a bit old and outside there were many cars passing by this results in an environment where you cannot have a good conversation
Love this place Reminds me of home a little as inside it feels like a london pub  Owners are lovely too
I actually dont know why its called American Bar Its absolutely not American
Excellent service and good prices for the zone
I have come here a couple of times for drinks and beer They have very nice cocktails Dark and Stormy was very good The beers are not compatible with every taste Some of them have very special strong flavour and they are difficult to drinkThe atmosphere of the bar is very beautiful and the service is good
Very nicely decorated establishment in the Zeeheldenbuurt in The Hague Good food some Asian fusion influence Tasty beers as well Staff is very friendly and helpful Being able to enjoy the sunny weather on the terrace was a bonus
We were looking for a decent place to eat which is not in the city center and where you can sit talk and have a good meal Van Kingsbergen is definitely a recommendation Our meal steak bavette was perfectly cooked everything tasted very very good and the staff was lovely Definetly a place which you shouldnt miss in the Hague
The place is very beautiful and cozy and its also nice to sit at the tables outside during winter thanks to the heaters The selection of food and beers is interesting Only downside is that its a bit pricey especially if you just want to have snacks with your drinks that are nothing special Anyway its worth a try
Awesome adventure
Such a cool location where locals meet to drink and catch up
Top
A nice little Bar
Make sure you bring cash as they force you to pay to use the toilet on every visit Which is absolutely unheard of if your already in the venue spending money Toilets are not clean and unjustified
First of all I would mention that food here is great We had special surprise offer for 2 persons and it was very nice tasty different dishes of meat and sea food with great taste combinations Liked it a lot but had to wait for food to long also final price for dishes was misunderstood by use so surprise was not only dishes After all nice evening
I have heard that Millers apparently is a nice clubbar to visit though I did not have the pleasure to visit because of an unjust situation  For the fact I a male potential customer had a fanny pack on me I was not allowed to enter the establishment When pointing out the fact that female customers had similar sized handbags and I even went as far as to offer my own bag be checked before entering I was still not allowed to I was in a group to celebrate a friends birthday they did not allow me entry because of a fanny pack with a similar size to other customers handbags  I believe the establishment to generally be of good quality and atmosphere although it is hearsay nevertheless I will probably avoid it altogether since whenever I am going out I have my fanny pack on me hence I personally cannot recommend the clubbar to anyone due to my unpleasant and sexist experience with it
If youre looking for clubbing then this is the wrong place The bodyguards are sexist and ive seen them violent They also make people pay 890 for tap water after already spending a lot of money thats more than a beer I saw on a few occasions how the security would be physically violent to people who didnt showed any aggression Me not included Also there are girls walking in with giant bags and as soon as you are male and have a little bag they wont let you in and will be really rude about it One time it was okay to let a girl in with my bag just because she was carrying it after being told i cant get inside Other times they would just make up completely different rules after looking at you The security is overall rude violent and sexist The worst clubbing experiences i had so far were there Dont recommend clubbing I dont have any information about the food
Friendly service good food and great atmosphere with comfortable seating Went here twice in one short visit to The Hague Only downside is less people watching compared to some of the cafes in this area
I adore this place Patient and attentive staff with an extensive selection of beers on draft and in bottles and cans Delicious fries and bitter balls with many choices for lunch and dinner Best of all the beer garden out back where you can pass the hours among the birds and trees And beer
Super cosy and friendly place  Good food good beers nice music what else do you need Edit Its always a pleasure to return here
Pretty cool place Food is tasty and theres a reasonable variety of beers to drink Music is not too loud so its very quite and calm to chat and enjoy your meal drink and foremost the company  Service is very good as well I regret not to have visited the restaurant earlier I crossed in front so many time and finally decide to give it a try It didnt disappoint
Great drink and chatty barmaid The moment I walked through the doors it felt like I was back in an Irish or British pub If you desire a drink that isnt Lager this is the place to go
Great little pub Guinness is good for the soul and Lucy is a lovely server Thank you  A pub can be filled with joy and the pub welcomes lots of happy people from all over the world having a good craik Sometimes they open the door for sadness to spend some time reflecting talking have a pint and a cry Today was one of those days Tomorrow will be better
Unfortunately did not have a kitchen so we could only get drinks They were really nice and switched channels so we could watch F1
Great place to grab a drink Be aware no food but you can get your own Get Guinness and Guinness IPA I would recommend it for football games Also has English commentary
Delicious Irish and British products of the best quality

If I were a student I would be there every eve They have a great beer list and the kitchen does a great job too The differentiator is the staff  super friendly accommodating and never miss a beat even when it is packed Thanks all We will always visit you when in Utrecht
Ambience is just missing something to be comparable to a real Irish pub and the staff is friendly but the most important part is the food and as the burguer paddy was the worst Ive ever had gotta give this a 25 The French fries are great though
Very nice cozy place for a good beer good burger and of course very good service from Simon  we will be back  triple karmeliet
Amazing bar we had a great night with Mr Balls pub quiz we will definitely visit again Prices are very decent and the staff friendly
its not open till 3am
Just for private events
Great beer
I was invited as a singer to perform in the cafe Joost during the birthday Had to tinker with the sound beforehand but Paul bartender managed to get it done technically and almost literally went off the roof afterwards What a great cozy pub to perform here recommended
Very friendly staff good beer and tasty large portions of food We ordered The Irishman and Porks Revenge which was too much for two person Super great taste
I love pubs I love Guinness so whats there not to like Last time it felt a bit like there was no air but we went in anyway  If it was open an hour longer that would have been perfect
Very quiet for a Saturday evening watched the rugby so it wasnt all bad Chicken wings are good hot sauce seriously spicy
The place is nice beer good and the food excellent  but the service destroyed it all for us
nice pub although in the weekends it gets super crowded and you may struggle to find somewhere to sit Nice vibe with friendly staff and you can play table football for 50 cents per match and pool for 1 per match Music is good usually and there are decent drinks and shots available Only issue is that drinks are overpriced as is usual for bars in Maastricht Still a lovely pub definitely worth visiting in a less busy day
Great bar Fair prices and a very lovely bartender The wheel of fortune is a great idea and the fact that its only 1 euro to spin it is amazing I spun it and had to go and collect all the glasses in the bar in return the bartender gave me a shot of Jager Very fun
You cannot deny the free spirited Irish of maastricht that is shamrock as an expat it reminds me of home you know goofy pool table and a slack of darts bartender is always accommodating and on point also with a sense of humor a must in every Irish bar
Didnt try the food But great staff decent beer Worth a visit 
We had various types of unique beers such as peanut butter beer and chocolate beer here and an amazing selection of bar food Thank you so much for the advice on how to choose our beers and even putting some in the fridge especially for us It was an amazing evening and were looking forward to return on our next visit to Maastricht
Great pub great food and great guiness Love the music and the people Its a great place to meet with friends to have a meal or a snack and definitly a drink Always a good conversation or watch a game Will be back soon
This place is the BEST Irish pub in town They have an incredible selection of goooood beers and have great music I highly recommend spending some time here
Awesome sports bar  I wanted to watch The Masters golf tournament and found this place Staff is amazing Beer selection is best in Maastricht They had a great Spotify playlist and best of all they introduced me to Danny Vera   Will definitely return next time Im in town
Genius place for students and people like me who want to feel student again for a night 
13   10 stamp card beer for inwstamp and long drink for two stamps recommande it
My friend took me to this place on the last night of my visit to Maastricht  The students who come here are loud obnoxious and too drunk to realize the beer they are being served is stale When we left after 20 min  one of the drunken   standing outside threw a glass bottle at a pedestrian across the street Outrageous Luckily he missed Stay away from this place
Its mostly crowded and the drinks quite expensive
Great staff and cheap drinks A friendly place where you feel included and welcomed at any time Look out for the events they organize 
First time at this very open and inclusive place Great diversity of genders Its not another gay bar Coc vibe  and The crew are volunteering and so the energy are very easy going fun and happy Highly recommend this place John the boss also know as delicious offer bingo night
Best Bar I have ever been to in my life The whole stuff was super friendly and made me feel super comfortable Pieter Roel and Mellany are awesome people will definitly come back after covid Sorry Wesley for pussying out Ill see you again
Everyone is so fun and welcoming Cant wait to go back
Love this place Often stay in Eindhoven for work and visit this place when in town  Friendly staff and a great ambience often rammed inside which is a good sign but have decent outside seating too  Good selection of beer they had Duvel 666 on tap which is my current favourite
Nice little bar Has an amazing atmosphere with nice bartenders It really is a tiny bar so you will be slightly cramped but its still a good time
One of the oldest in Eindhoven One can sit outside or inside there are seats around the counter Different options for drink based on your choice One of the place where I have visited several times with colleagues and friends  This is right opposite to Vapiano near to the church A friendly host and a good selection of drinks Many locals visit this place Casual atmosphere with a small screen to watch the sport or listen to good selections of background music
Great little bar Sat outside and watched the world go by Chip place next door and they are happy got you to eat your takeaway there
Very good service Especially the popcorn and tea Nice boss
Best hostess in town Este is just lovely
Very cosy home Definitely a recommendation 
Destiny was here
Accidentally walked passed this place on the first day of our week long business trip and ended up coming for at least one drink every night The bar keepers were very friendly and helped me discover my new found love for sour beers With a selection of over 800 beers everyone can find something they like and if not just ask the bar keepers for help and they will help you find something delicious  a must visit in Eindhoven Gezelligheid
What a bar over 950 different beers I bet the date checking and stock rotation takes some time Extremely knowledgeable bar staff They even have collabed beers with the local brewery Had an IPA infused with Jamesons Quirky toilets too
Amazing beers selection also locally crafted Great atmosphere and also great and friendly stuff
I dont drink but they had a great selection of non alcohol beer Great little stop
I organized a dinner for a group of 30 colleagues The pricing was very reasonable and we received the food very quickly The food was fine the service was fine the atmosphere was comfortable Definitely recommend this place for an informal group dinner The only feedback I would have is that if they had asked if we wanted to drink something more often we probably would have bought more drinks
service was good but the food was very lacking  Korean fried chicken were some frozen nuggets with a sauce splattered over it there was no kimchi  on it  the burger patty was burnt  maybe it was because it was super busy but consistency is very important nonetheless  friendly staff though and a good place for drinking
A great place to stop in to eat and drink and relax The restaurant has a  good vibe and very close to the Cathedral
Really nice place and close to the center  Cathdrale I also like how quick were the waiters waitresses to bring our drinks as well as   snacks Personally I found the process quite affordable We ordered nachos and French fries with truffle sause super delicious However I didnt appreciate at all the  smell of toilet something like toilet that I couldnt understand where it comes from not from their own toilets because I had used them and they were very clean and not smelly but unfortunately thats a reason why I wouldnt go back this place again Hope this problem could be solved soon
Chicken teriyaki sandwich and philly cheese steak sandwich Absolutely the best chicken sandwich ever The Philly was also really good but shadowed by the teriyaki chicken Highly recommend
Great cafe in the middle of Eindhoven with outside and inside seating  The waiters were flying through the cafe and very good at their service  We didnt wait long at all for our food  We got burgers and a Philly cheese steak sandwich which were all amazing  Really good tasting food and a nice variety of beers  Very big and comfortable tables to sit in and it could accommodate children too  The bathrooms were in pristine condition  This is definitely the first place I will go to when I visit Eindhoven again
A bit noisy place because of full house but really lekker food Strongly recommend   Only negative there was  no soap in the woman toilet and after inform the staff and waited 30 minutes there was still no soap They should check better the womans toilet
I went for a Coke It was great weather Did not expect to find a table on the terrace thus went straight inside and asked for one Unfortunately I was not welcome due to insufficient personnel Coming outside the first table on the left was free and thus I could have my Coke
Bobbys is simply amazing Best place in Eindhoven for when you want to have an amazing date  The cocktails are designed by the crew and change every season Moreover the cocktails are delicious There is something for everyone from sweet and tropical to bitter and herbal  We had the Save the Panda Chasing Summer I like it Plum and Black Orchid They were all delicious but Save the Panda was absolutely mindblowing because it tastes exactly like Spekkoek  The atmosphere is really cool too If you come regularly you could watch the wax towers grow  Also the crew is lovely and very knowledgeable Always willing to help you get the right drink and to answer any questions  It is a little bit more pricey but you do get a unique experience in return  All in all go to Bobbys
Probably best cocktails in town A lot of options and excellent service in guiding you to understand what you want  They nailed it for me Passionate margherita
Very bad customer service We were with a group of three One of our friends is participating in ramadan and didnt want to drink However they have a one drink policy which is such a shame She felt so uncomfortable that she just decided to leave After she left they asked us to move to a smaller table However we are both large guys and the tables are extremely small Moving to a smaller table wasnt necessary because it wasnt busy at all Would definitely not recommend Will never be coming here again
Great atmosphere delicious cocktails The staff member who served us was very knowledgeable and extremely friendly Hope to see you in the Black Cat at some point 
Nice little university cafe It can become a bit crowded with students but still it has a nice atmosphere to mingle with colleagues It offers a good selection of beers snacks and good meals with reasonable student prices
Nice student bar offers food aswell and has studentstaff looking out that folk dont get too drunk Can be loud at times and obnoxious when the associations have their little screaming stick stomping rituals but otherwise a nice place to hang out with friends after a long day of uni  Big fan of the elevated tables that make things a bit more private in such a busy room  Can be difficult to get inside passed a certain hour because of the way the building is structured
Very cosy and friendly place to sit down and relax with friends A college bar in the sense that 95 of people there are 1825 but much more cosy than usual student life Effectively a living room thats open to the public
Payed a whole 5 for very little fries and not enough sauce get about half of what you can expect at stratum definetly do not recommend
Great Craic plenty of friendly people to have a chat with good beer and Brilliant service and the Irish lads that work there are fun to speak to
Great Place to have a good beer
Pretty small but cosy place with friendly and and easy going staff The only bad thing would be the stairs to their bathroom which are narrow and steep Plus unfortunately for me I got stuck in the bathroom and spent some tome in there since there was no way to communicate with people downstairs Overall chill bar thats not too expensive
Ireland in Groningen since at least 25 years Best preserved real Irish pub life probably not even to be found anymore in Ireland itself
Would highly recommend paying a visit Great music even better food  So glad I popped in  Good reviews helped me out on this one  You wont be disappointed
A nice Irish bar with a good selection of beer Often playing live sports on the big screen While we didnt eat there the burgers looked amazing and were very popular with other customers
Tasty burger tasty fries but i thought beers itll be cold as my ex girlfriend heart but it wasnt Warm la chouffe beer is awful
Curly fries and chicken amazing Nachos fine but not as good as the other two The regular fries are basic but very very good and perfectly crusty The waiter was nice and suggested good local beers Interior and music gives the perfect vibe On a monday evening it was not busy so thats good 
excellent bar nice atmosphere super drinks and we are lucky that Monday watch the live jazz band with the Greek musicians
Was drawn in by the funny signs I stayed for the music and the fun strangers I met They played classic rock all evening which is refreshing for a Dutch place Usually you hear only jazz or top100 The American bartender was really friendly too Their beer selection isnt very big but the place is cozy and fun
Lovely place cozy interior great selection of beers order a Maries cocktail if you go highly recommend Music is super chili not too loud and you can talk and the girls like to get everyone dancing when it get busy In general great crowd If you are in Groningen make sure to stop by
The music is great classic rock and blues also the live is very good The service is friendly they even offered me some snacks with the beer which I wouldnt mention otherwise because thats the typical but not in Netherlands as i have discovered so far  The one star is missing because they have putted little effort to the menu No prices and sizes for the beer which is something frustrating
Great live music sessions on Saturday nights Awesome atmosphere and as a bonus there is quite nice smokerfriendly terrace with heating lamps
The big Grlsch fliptop bottles are the BEST value Not too many places to drink a beer AND enjoy  around Groningenthis place had great music and super chill vibe
Very friendly place roll inside with a good beer smoke outside in good company 
Nice and friendly place Great live music jam session on Sunday
Excellent bar in Groningen Staff are always very friendly and delicious selection of cocktails at an affordable price Easy drinks spot
Neat bar very nice service relatively good Cocktails but the whisky sour was unfortunately a bit watered down I think it is due to not using solid ice cubes for shaking and serving but hollow ones
Highly recommended surprised it wasnt fully packed Steak alway gorgeous taco always freshly made cocktails as they should be  read strong 
Great restaurant with our wonderful waitress Beatrice Very organized and fast I recommend to go here 1010
Nice atmosphere friendly service only the vegetable was old and didnt taste fresh
Very disappointed Guy working at bar kept slamming cupboards etc every few minutes which gave a fright each time Ordered entrecte but received a different cut and because we were waiting a while and hungry i didnt want to complain and have to wait even longer to eat  The lobster is chewy and not easy to eat or even scoop out without some of it flying off the plate
Bad experience Chips cold on 34 plates in our group chicken undercooked steak asked medium and got well done and cold Was also expensive for what we got Would not recommend here for food Drinks maybe only
The food was amazing and the atmosphere really friendly and cozy The bartender and rest of the staff were really really nice I would definitely recommend We went during the week so it wasnt crowded but I suspect it could get a little more wild later in the evening so you might want to take this into account
Huge prices tiny portions Food was oily and tasteless No cold drinks on a hot day only the bottled soft drinks that you can get in any supermarket Bread pudding was not the real deal just some sweet stuff between sliced bread Disappointing menu  Service basically nonexistent compared to other restaurants of the same price range Waiter even looked disgusted when I requested to have my coffee with whipped cream common in some parts of the world Felt discriminated Commented on the portion sizes to the waitress only replied nonchalantly that they were different dishes  All the while pretentious music was playing in the background What a shame on the beautiful building One can easily get a better experience for half the price still within the city center
This restaurant is spacious and has a good crew of servers The food is fresh and well prepared Our group ate from a fixed menu of a choice of beef fish or quiche The tomato basil soup was the starter and dessert was a raspberry meringue  The restaurant lets itself down with slow service It took over an hour for the entree Total time start to dessert was three hours
Nice location food portions were extremely different from each other And was also quite bland Service was bad  Also cost way too much
Went here with my husband We had the steak It was delicious It was smoked and large There were roasted vegetables on the side
The amount of craft beers 400 available in this caf is just insane and definitely worth a visit if you are into craft beer
Its my favourite cafe in the city stuff is professional and extra nice there is long list of beers ciders and whisky Whatever you gonna choose its good and tasty Plenty beers from small breweries You can buy there pub tshirt and beer glass In busy days might be good idea to reserv the table
We did a random 3beer menu and it was fun to taste beers that Ive never had before They told us something about all of the beers The staff was super friendly a big recommendation
Great pub with 100ths of different beers from The Netherlands  Belgium and other countries  Quick service  Somewhat loud noise level from the guests
Vegan croissant heaven Super delicious crispy buttery croissant The Rawnola Bowl with coconut yoghurt was really good too Fresh fruit and crunchy Rawnola Oat milk is the regular milk here and you have to pay extra for cows milk Thats how it should be at any place Love this concept They also have two different vegan sweet breakfast bowls two or three savory paninis or sandwiches and a vegan banana bread Coffee is really delicious Lovely place
The service was great Hannah was so lovely helping us decide and served us swiftly and quickly I had the carrot cake which is to die for and a dirty chai with oat milk Will definitely be coming back here very soon
Nice place to have a cup of coffee and study The staff was respectful and friendly The cafe has plenty of seating The cappuccino was not as expectedoverall great place to visit
A great place to study Lots of space both downstairs and upstairs Hannah our waitress was very attentive and gave us great recommendations I would recommend the dirty chai Thank you Hannah 
The food is great the atmosphere is really cool The pizza is tasty but you cant come here without trying THE PITA
Been here a few times now and every time I really liked it They have lots of drinks to choose from my favourite is whatever the bartender recommends that night some vegan food options and the staff is nice Theres a lil cabinet with games to play in case you need some more entertainment Pet friendly as well Ive made friends with a dog or two here
This place is wonderful for an hour of chilling the drinks are good music is okay and the chairs are comfortable It is a recommended place to visit I did not try there food but I think they have some food to offer They even have a terrace for them which is good
Love this place Staff is very friendly and the overall vibe is very chill and laid back Went here for the hangover brunch the buffet is amazing from sweet to savoury They even provide vitamin C tablets Had a lovely time here
Staff were super friendly Food was a reasonable price and quality I enjoyed my meal The frites were cooked perfectly
Great food  easy ordering Perfect
An excellent cozy not overpriced restaurant to grab borrel after visiting the market They have a few vegetarian options and some average beers on tap Its usually crowded so service can be slow and the tables are really packed in so be prepared to get friendly with your neighbor But everyone does seem to be friendly and cheerful here Plus theres occasionally a charming pianist who adds even more to the old world atmosphere of the place
Very delicious and tasteful fish  the staff is very kind and friendly  we definately come back
Absolutely fabulous dining experience Everything is authentically made from scratch and you can tell that the people making your food care Its a very American experience that you will truly enjoy with family and friends
Found 2 seperate hairs in our food when we arrived and sat down she told us the kitchen was closed WHILE we were ordering had to get food from the neighbouring restaurant service was pretty unenthusiastic and the atmosphere was dead Also stinky toilets
I came here early on a Saturday afternoon and enjoyed a session IPA and a breakfast sandwich called a Breakfast Bun The staff were very friendly and the environment was cozy laid back and rustic The food was great and it was just what I was looking for It had cheesy scrambled eggs bacon avocado and a beef patty on a brioche bun There was also a nice selection of hot sauces to try out Ill be definitely returning here to try out their other food Recommend   Update They have a great beer selection here I found Green Flashs West Coast IPA here which I havent seen in Europe for a few years  Update 20 Im here all the time The burgers tacos and chicken are the best in the city Danny knows whats up Come hangggg
Had lunch here on Saturday Excellent selection of melts as well as some other great food options You can have a beer here as well pretty broad selection Ask for hot sauce if you like it spicy
Great cafe to play games and drink craft beer Excellent service and recommendations when time allows Be aware one table one bill
Good bar and great experience had a lot of fun
Excellent venue Staff was very knowledgeable about the beer available and I liked the vibe here
Another great local pub The bar tender was friendly and very helpful We had a great chat and enjoyed some of the local beers The pub was fairly chilled at 01h15 when we popped in for a quick night cap Will definitely visit again when back in Tilburg
The brownie cake piece was big Friendly service
We met up with friends and went there a few times The service was lovely Our server was super nice and funny The food is amazing Highly recommend
IT WAS SO BADDDD  Waited 1h 30m for our food just for it to be cold and have hair in the fries When we told the employee she told us to take it and continue eating it Then with her dirty she pullled out the hair and said Enjoy We also paid in cash and she didnt return the change which was about 20 euros Would never step here again BE CAREFUL
Really huge bar and restaurant in the heart of Tilburg The food is ok good selection of beers  we really liked the Anvers Blonde Heated outside terrace
Great vibe beer and bar food from the afternoon to around midnight The bitterballen are great
500 sorts of beer and special glass for most of them Nice atmosphere Mention that almost no food but some good snacks cheese balls are very good Note that Vasily Vasilievich Kandinsky is Russian painter father of abstractionism born in Moscow 1866 and died in France 1944 Some locals think he was polish musicianops
Wonderful atmosphere and amazing selection of beer If you need to quench your thirst while in Tilburg go here
Large choice of national and international beer Cosy atmosphere Reservation recommended
No guiness mutphys clouey dunp dirty dark staff very of hauey need i go on
Local bar Prices may differ if you are nicely drunk One day while paying 11 Euros for the same alcohol it costs 2 We paid 13 Euros for the same alcohol every day
Cozy pub with friendly staff very quiet for a Friday evening
Reasonable pub Apart from the decoration it cannot be called very Irish younger staff are skilled at tapping whistles but have no idea about IrishEnglish specialities Visited several times but always a little disappointed once in a while even left because the bar staff behaved disinterested and rude  A plus a good local cafe for going out because the opening hours are very long on weekends However the name Irish Pub raises expectations that are not met
Best place in Almere Buiten Waiters are the nicest They all attend us in English Salads are delicious both salmon andor nuts The hamburger highly recommended too The kitchen is the latest at Almere
Good atmosphere and friendly staff Will come back
Really nice place costs not too excessive lovely outdoor spot in almere buiten centre very personable waiting staff and service In general was very friendly and good
Nice tasty wel prepared food I had salmon baked on the skin which was nice and crisp and the salmon was nice and juicey Friendly and helpful crew For a fair price
Ordered slowcooked duck steak and pork skewer plus some beer The dishes were nice but were a bit too salty for us Nice place to grab a quick drink  bite
The owner is nice and the food is good Great price to quality ratio The menu is only in Dutch however
Friendly staff wonderful ambiance Excellent food Even better drinks
Really nice place nice drinks and really nice staff I do recommend
Simply a place I would definitely come back for drinks I have been bar hopping around the city and this made me stay Lots of whiskeys to choose from of Course Guiness from the tap  Great music and love the typical Irish Pub concept
Never fails Rugby football cricket served with a gravey of authentic pub
Great Irish pub with good beer and in the weekend live music
Lovely pub great atmosphere great service perfect experience
We had a blast here Food drinks music And the staff is amazing Mika and Ines are amazing there Give them a raise
I found the staf to be very nice Had a wonderful experience just people watching and snacking on some snacks I heard they have bilingual pub quizzes twice a week But you need to notify them to make sure they have space because its popular with the regulars
Great new addition to Breda Lovely typical Irish food and the usual Irish breakfast with Clonakilty sausages Guinness and Kilkenny on draught plus the normal Dutch beers Plenty seating inside or outside If youre looking for a nice evening out and food thats not going to break the bank then this is the place to be
Love that place Whenever Im in Breda usually once a year Im going there having some beer and ribs with colleagues Super friendly staff reasonable prices and located in the city center in a lively and beautiful location Already looking forward to my next visit
Comfortable atmosphere with friendly staff  Food is mediocre frozen foods that are heated with various methods  Not worth the prices they charge
A nice place with good comfort food Some good beers  desert too Room to sit in or out as well
Was a lovely meal and the waiter was a kind gentleman
Travelling Holland  sampling local restaurants cafes with differing levels of success but what a lovely place this is Saff are delightful and couldnt help more which is backed up by great food  drinks  Well done  I hope anyone visiting Made drops in and samples the lovely hospitality of The Pub 
Nice atmosphere good beer and so friendly staff
Nice atmosphere easy going good music
Pretty nice people nice music also rock
Good beer thats enough 
Maddox is a beautiful and really big restaurant We ordered some beers garlic bread and the iron steak Sadly the beer only served in small glasses The gaelic bread was very good however the steak although looking good was really mediocre and not on the level as I requested medium rare and got almost well done
Amazing bar and restaurant Expecially their cocktails glad the bar had time and was actually able to make me some offmenu cocktails The food was very good way better then expected
Took 20 minutes to get some snacks waiter promised to ask the kitchen and give feedback she never came back The atmosphere is amazing
Waited 1h for a food that never came Not even a sorry was received Left the place
Great traditional Dutch tevern
Very friendly owner and up for a nice chat Beautiful brown caf with delicious wine Unfortunately we live too far otherwise it would certainly be the favorite pub for Friday afternoon drinks
BREDA  After 37 years Ger Couvreur says goodbye to his Tapperijke on the Grote Markt in Breda The brown caf has been taken over immediately by the owners of the opposite caf De Pastorie The Tapperijke will remain as it is they let us know The oldest bartender in Breda is a household name in entertainment circles He is the singer of carnival classic De Muts A song that regularly blares through the pub invariably rhythmically accompanied by Couvreur himself who skilfully hits the bottles above the bar with drumsticks Cozy old caf with a nice caf owner who likes a joke Nice tent with great ambiance and fun for city trippers and groups caf is at the foot of the large church
I only came there twice a year usually at a lost moment and every time you enter it is like putting on a warm coat Ger made everyone feel like they are a regular The pub itself Wonderfully brown in a fantastic location although you can never see the most beautiful church tower in the country from t Tapperijke  Thanks Ger
Highly recommended not a super big caf but all the necessities to have a perfect evening with friends And with a bit of luck there will be live music or a good DJ
Outside looks nice of this cafe nice terrace good look Inside it is a tired and somewhat bare pub Purely focused on alcoholic refreshments Dont expect coffee and tea but beer and beer Despite the moderate crowds it cannot be called clean The tables still had empty glassware etc lying around Not the place to sit during the day great for a beer in the evening while going out
Smooth pleasant host super tasty drink boards and just outside the hustle and bustle of the center No coffee or tea but affordable beers and wines Place to be for nonsense Burgundian drinks
Private party given in Borrel Bar Breda Everything was arranged as agreed Friendly bartender tasty snacks and drinks for a great price Music was fine I had a very pleasant evening
Very nice cafe  lots of choices for drinks and very friendly staff great for meeting with like 20 people max
Lost in time bring your mood up for the moment you walk in Great company music and drinks
t Hijgend Hert is a caf that will immediately make you feel at home The staff is always friendly and open minded about opening their doors to all kinds of events there is a nice range of beers on draft and they will probably have something to your liking
Best bar in Breda
You wont be served here its a self order bar where you have to get your drinks at the counter and get like a food buzzer that will notify you when the food is ready  Not my style but definetly nice bar servers and the top floor has some game tables like snooker The cafe looked nice from outside and inside  Music was good too
A really nice and cosy caf You can drink a lot of different beers here for a cheaper price because there is no service You order at the bar yourself and take your drinks to a seat The best caf for students
Just the place for coffee and to watch the world go by
No tabel service but a really nice selection beer The also offerend a lot of food and pricing is decent
Were actually just looking for a place to hide from heavy rain on a Sunday afternoon but stayed for a beer because of the great atmosphere and super kind waitress Definitely recommend
Great atmosphere good music cool service tasty and not diluted cocktails Thank you for your patience 
Such an amazing place The biggest cup of coffee I ever had in Montenegro   loved it
Its OK Ive been here three times with a range of experiences First time was terrible I walked out as the service was non existent  and this whilst the place was dead Second time was Ok better service and decent cocktails Third time was also OK 2 out of three isnt bad  Its an OK pub Service seems to be better when the place is busier  in the evening Its open to a decent time Around 10ish tables outside its pretty close to a late night clubbar so could be a decent pre club venue  Apparently there is fuzball and darts inside A couple of TV screens are on inside which had football on  Edit Slight change but they do now take card payments so Ive added another star
Ordered 8 meals and even after checking with the waiter we got only 5 Cocktails were more expensive than advertised on the menu When we mentioned this to the staff they just laughed it away Food was quite alright though
Najdrazi lokal u Podgorici Wonderful place great hospitality the staff is very nice the drinks are amazing I highly recommend this place
Was last night It was great The atmosphere the music everything  
Food was okay but the waiters constantly forgot meals and when we received the bill they raised the prices of all cocktails claiming it was an old menu and just laughed Tourist trap
Best bar in Podgorica Good craft beer wide assortment good music atmosphere and most importantly awesome bartenders that can suggest you drinks basing on your preferences By the way recently I celebrated birthday on the top floor of the bar and it was awesome If you want to spend your time in company of friends you certainly need to reserve top floor and do it You can order food from any delivery and grab it with you upstairs then grab some beer some cocktails plug a Nintendo Switch in TV that is there share joy cons with your friends and enjoy most relaxing and joyful time in bar that you have ever had  So glad that my friends took me it this bar
Pleasant place and tasty beer Not so much choice but I found one which I like  The staff is very friendly
Great place  awesome atmosphere watching football gamesor movies or just enjoy in beer or coffee
Great place to spend time with friends The staff is very friendly and nice 
4 out of 5 because I had good experience here before but this good experience happens at random The location is interesting and unique in Podgorica which is great and it is really pleasant to sit here The last time waiters had no idea about dishes in the menu and were not able to explain the dishes to us Also we ordered mixed meat but 2 items from that mix were missing even though they were written as a part of it in the menu we were not told it would be ommited The waitress told us it comes with different dips but it came with only one They didnt have the cake that was in the menu but we waited 10min for the waitress to check if they had it and come back to tell us they dont These things happen every second time we visit and since it became pricier I doubt it is worth the price at this state And we never know if visiting will make or ruin our day  Service like this is not unusual for Montenegrin restaurants unfortunately I like this restaurant and I wish their management would get a grip on these problems since it has been happening forever and I see it in the comments here My colleagues asked me never to come here again except for drinks and it just might be the case for some time in the future
Great service optional prices tasty food Nice place out of city center
An extremely strange place The food is of very poor quality We ordered several dishes one turned out to be simply inedible and the other two caused severe poisoning For some unknown reason you can not order hot drinks coffee or tea the waiter says that there are no hot drinks but if you really ask they suddenly appear Half of the dishes on the menu cannot be ordered I do not recommend this place  take care of your health
Nice place for lunch or dinner Pet friendly They have an English menu which you can follow and the icecream they have is really delicious and worth trying
Rude waiters they wont serve the behavior is extremely ugly the place to avoid
the best pub and place to go in the whole Niki great owners great service great beers for great prices great music great atmosphere simply great expirience
The kindest and most efficient service Fairly priced drinks and cool atmosphere
Very nice place
Every time I visit this bar Im reminded of its unparalleled charm The space is cozy creating an inviting atmosphere that encourages relaxation and conversation The staff are truly commendable  their warmth and attentiveness stand out The unique ambiance of this place is its biggest draw it has an indescribable aura that keeps pulling me back Live music events featuring mostly local bands with the occasional international act add a special touch to the experience enhancing the already vibrant mood Cant recommend this place enough
Really nice cocktails they only took cash though
A favourite coffee spot in Niki right in front of the main square in the city This place in recognizable for the umbrellas at their terrace During nice weather the terrace is packed with people Interior is mixed with industrial and retro furniture What i like the most about this place is the fact they let stray dogs inside when its cold Friendly staff lovely people makes it all even nicer
Such a cool place decor service  everything
Good prizes for good drinks
Nice spot
The place to be when visiting HercegNovi to enjoy a drink and even sometimes a dance nearby the sea dont miss it
Great for chilling  and perfect view on the sea
I came to this place for the first time 2 years ago Since then one of my favorite pubs in Montenegro   It is quite enjoyable to take a long breath on the stairs and watch the passersby  The music playing is excellent   Prices are quite affordable  The guy working here also provides very friendly service  It is one of the places I would recommend you to go not only in Herceg Novi but throughout Montenegro
Wow what a amazing Pub  Good draught beers and cozy atmosphere inside and outside If youre looking for the perfect place for a cold beer in Herceg Novi visit Got Pub 
Probably the best Place for Beer Lovers in northern Montenegro Really nice Location fair prices good atmosphere We will come againand again
Great pub very close to the Old Town Good selection of draft beers around 6 on draft as well as bottles Get the local Blonda beer poured from a Saxophone tap One of the best beers Ive had in a long time and only 3EUR for 05l
Budva old town is very lucky to have a pub like this Its charm is delightful from the dcor to the staff esp Gandra  The local beer is decently priced for Budva Go here and chat to Gandra he will warmly welcome you and happily engage in a conversation if you wish May we all meet one day down Penny Lane with someone pulling a pint for you
Good place is like an airing pub with quite relaxed music  I would be back
Great pub in the lovely narrow streets of the old townpop in and say hello  Dragan runs the bar great service The owners  also  own the secret garden restaurant up on the left hand side  A great night out dont forget the local Raki 
Just had a drink Very friendly lady invited us in Served us straight away Located in the beautiful old town We sat outside people watching Would definitely recommend
Nice view and atmosphere Food was not bad but could be better and as well the service The fish platter was big the other dishes were normal size I like the dessert the most It was a pancake filled with chocolate and had vanilla cream and jam on top
I never wrote a bad recession  but this is one worth The only good thing is the Ambiente Our water glass was dirty The service was not the best But the worst was definitely the meal On the menu was written salad It was one piece without any dressing You can see a picture attached  Ive never seen such loveless food Every snack bar around the corner is better Price performance was more than bad
Great place although I just had coffee this time Will come back for food the menu looked great and the restaurant seems to be full all the time  Located on one of nicest spots in Budva really nice Just in front of the old town and marina its fantastic  Update The food is very good average and rather expensive but I guess you pay for the location as well which is fair
Very nice place with a good menu selection We had the fish and chips and the black risotto The black risotto served by them was actually the best we had during our trip both in Montenegro and Croatia Friendly and quick service good prices
Absolutely delicious food very funny and helpful waiter perfect placement and prices 55
My boyfriend and I had a lovely lunch here while visiting the old town The place has a really calm atmosphere and nice terrace where we enjoyed some pork neck and grilled squid both of which were delicious Considering the location it has quite good prices so would highly recommend if coming by
Its located in a street thats less attractive as the others But dont be fooled they come and help with great service and tasty food I had requested a dietary request on a dish and the staff was nothing but helpful and didnt make me feel like a hassle either Prices are reasonable I would definitely come back
The waiter is very pleasant Food is excellent Atmosphere is great Compared to other restaurants in old Budva this is the best choise to come and eat or have drinks Very nice really And not expensive as the rest We were super satisfied 
It was an amazing experience lovely music perfect service thanks for delicious food and waiter Matija was nice towards us I recommend this place for people who knows how to enjoy a vacation 
Had an amazing night the owner is so fun and welcoming Definitely coming again
The beautiful lady recommend one of the best pizza in Montenegro ive ever eaten Great atmosphere great people
Had a great time here the past few nights Great vibe and great people
Best place for drink coffee beside sea
Top Coctails Music
WC is not that great
Perfect location great service and delicious coffee with a large glass of water at a low price
The hygiene is horrible We ordered an orange juice and found a bug was floating on it we then asked to redo it but it was still the previous one  they just took the bug out and serve it again instead of redo the drink The food is also terrible  but thanks god this time no bugs any more
Gorgeous beach view efficient service friendly staff and decent food We had the cream pie it was really good We went back several times and we were never disappointed
Good and tasty food Bread should be better but overall nice place 45Dont miss shrimps and black rise
Really nice restaurantgrill on beachfront polite and experienced staff l food was top notch portions were just big enough to make a 240 pound man full  prices are adequate probably under the location medium  Drinks were cold and were delivered less than a minute from being ordered while food arrived within 7 minutes and was very fresh as their grill staff works like crazy Will come back and would recommend to anyone visiting this area  Bare in mind it can get a bit crowded as it is right next to beach and everyone wants to eat here Which I presume also says well about the food and service here  Only thing I regret is wasting money in a nearby restaurant Amadeus  with the outmost worst service every for the past few days while this jewel was hiding 100 feet away
We have been at Azzurro several times for beach lunch and dinner during our stay in Budva They have some of the best service we have had here and all the food was tasty You can also have a amazing view of the moon Our waiter Alexander was always smiling and making us feel really welcome and we will miss him
Fresh fish Orada was very very good Atmosphere not more than 4 simple restaurant and some waiters wearing inappropriate clothes for work Service was okay
We spent there the whole day at the beach 15 for two sun beds Ordered pizza and watermelon for lunch and some drinks during the day too All was good 
Only had a drink so cant comment on food but the location is fantastic right next to the old town walls and on the beach also the fans were fantastic on a very hot and sunny day
I mean Just take my money Best cocktails best service Best ambience the sweetest littlest place I have ever seen Just go there And leave a good tip 
very delicious signature cocktails nice atmosphere highly recommended best place in Budva
Signature cocktail recommended by the staff really made my night Great choice in the heart of Budva old town
I had high hopes for this cocktail bar Wed just spent three nights in Kotor and enjoyed craft cocktails at Nitrox every night Mixology staff is really nice and they work to be accommodating but they need to improve the vibe and seating There are two little tables in a courtyard across from the bar and a few hightop tables inside The courtyard is dark the chairs rickety and mine was missing a wood plank There was no music They were out of a key ingredient for both of our drinks Cocktails were tasty but we were the only guests there They could really improve their business by adding some hip European beach music string lights potted plants and better seating And pretty garnishes for the cocktails More tourists will come more will take photos more will leave better reviews
Perfect
Great bar If you are not hungry and there is no food here and want to sit in a pleasant atmosphere a la Tarantino then come here for a cup of coffee
Stunning view good coffee
Good coffee

Nice beach side bar good coffee and frittas reasonably priced
If no tips to arrogant waiters they wont come to you next time Last time ordered risotto with seafoods God bless I didnt break my tooth but cut my gum by unpeeled mussel Good place to drink beverages from dirty scratched cups with nice view
Service is very slow we waited between hour and a half Steak was dry and unseasoned Other plates were okay but not much flavor A bit pricey for what you actually get but portions are big Too bad the flavors are meh  Not coming back again
Wait staff was rude Told us we could order food Didnt show up for 45 minutes then told us to wait 2 hours for food Started serving others before us who arrived later Very rude and raised voices at us
I hadnt expected this level of quality from a pub named after a famous American highway But the food was tasty and cooked to perfection
Good for quick snack and having beer  We preferred the seat outside for the experience of city view  Its not expensive restaurant you can enter with your family and crowded groups with no hesitation 
Bad The dish brought lacks the ingredients specified in the menu The food is often oversalted The price on the menu differs from what is brought in the bill It was much better here in winter
I can not believe this place has so much to offer The food is top quality There is a great breeze in the outdoor areas The bar has lots of different offerings This will be a new favorite go to for dining and fun
Best place ever in menton in order to enjoy a good moment  Its only there where u can drink and dance in this city
Have been watching World Cup Rugby there Nice to have pub atmosphere in Menton
Very nice peopple I enjoy my time there
Super friendly and very hospitable owners You can tell they love what they do It changes some people in Menton Reasonable consumption prices Very friendly atmosphere I highly recommend and I will definitely come back  I wish them a good continuation  Katia Mathieu and Noah from Strasbourg 
Nice bar in Monaco  The bar is great always full of people so sometimes its hard to find a place to sit outside  the drinks are a bit expensive asides from this still a great place to have some drinks with friends
Trinity is divided into two sections One serves as a local pub showing sports games on the big screen football boxing rugby and offers live music This side is more popular with students and those who like to watch sports Often find that the service here is better than on the other side which has a more mature audience That said it is equally as busy on the weekend so it is best to reserve a table in advance Overall I like coming here and its good for groups
I recently visited this Irish bar in Monaco hoping for a taste of Irish hospitality and cuisine Unfortunately my experience fell far short of my expectations  Firstly the food left much to be desired It was not only overpriced but the quality didnt justify the cost The flavors were bland and for the price the portions were disappointingly small Adding to the disappointment my cheeseburger arrived nearly 40 minutes later and it was devoid of any garnishno tomato no onion nothing  Secondly the service was a major letdown Our server displayed a lessthanfriendly attitude which detracted from the overall dining experience Hospitality is a fundamental aspect of any establishment and it was noticeably lacking here  I would also like to add that the Guinness a cherished staple in any Irish bar and a source of national pride was dreadful  I was genuinely looking forward to enjoying my visit to an Irish bar in Monaco but regrettably it did not meet my expectations  Maybe hiring some Irish staff could help foster the right attitude and create the proper atmosphere to make this place worthy of its branding
Lively atmosphere with modern design and good music  excellent food and drinks menu and fantastic service to match Ive been here numerous times and am never disappointed
Swanky bar tucked into side of lobby Cocktails and wine 2930 euros each Great vibes sometimes live music Definitely a memorable night out
Top quality service and drinks The staff is fabulous and you can feel their high service ambitions at every moment Discreet helpful and knowledgeable Its exactly what you would expect for 5 stars 
Great place to share with friends or a romantic date Awesome appetizers and great service
Its very good placewas available and surprised me with the veaw and delicious cesare salad Super fast team and huge terrace outside and life band inside
Great casual wine bar with a broad range of open wines for reasonable prices Yesterday Friday evening even with live music  They also offer food lt is a good place for a snack late in the evening when restaurants in Fontvieille have already closed or dint serve food anymore  At lunchtime there is a special offer with starter main course and dessert see photo of the menu of Friday 3112020
Wonderful location good pizza and excellent staff one of my favourite places to grab a late night beer in Monaco
Beautiful location relaxed atmosphere and great staff
This place is located in a quiet area but still  it is close to many local points of interest Foods  drinks and staff are all good  we had no reason to complain Prices are moderate
Abysmal  We had a 5 star experience at the restaurant next door  thought wed finish the night with a cocktail  We were ignored when we walked in despite the inside part of the bar being mostly empty We took a table inside near the bar which was central After trying to get the waitresses attention for about 10 minutes I finally caught her eye despite her walking past us multiple times empty handed I asked her for a menu then after 20 minutes of waiting and the same waitress walking past our table again multiple times again we gave up and left  Im sure Ill get a generic copypaste apology below but we will never be back again
Nice bar Lots of fun and nice people
High end experience of Monagasque cocktail skills and snacks
Great place with great view Very pleasant staff and magician tricks were amazing Only bad side is that shisha staff are offering free shishas on them and put it on the bill later but manager was super friendly and solved the issue Other than that is 55
What a find This place has it all From the moment we were seated to the moment we paid it was a complete experience We started with the bruschetta  a must have  followed by a shared charcuterie board and paired with a beautiful wine The owner was extremely knowledgable about the wines and cheeses ensuring we had an amazing culinary experience Great atmosphere in a lovely setting with great banter with the staff Definitely one well be returning to
This wine bar has so much potential because the staff are knowledgeable and the ingredients used are of very high quality However the layout of the restaurant is bizzare and this lets it down a little The first night we visited we ate at a food trolley which was very uncomfortable but the only table we were allowed to sit at as it accommodated 2 The second night there was a beer barrel with 3 seats at it and we were refused service on the basis that there were 2 of us even though no one else was waiting and mostly at home you would limit a barrel to 2 seats for serving food There is also a lot of seating inside which doesnt appear to be utilised at least at we didnt observe it being used Music food and wine is excellent and a high standard compared to some other restaurants but comfort and customer service and making particularly a repeat customer feel valued is very important We didnt return for the rest of our stay for that reason
This place was amazing Stefanie took the time to explain each wine and every meat and cheese on the plate You can really tell her passion for her craft and it makes the experience very special What a great night
Very nice atmosphere and staff The girl working there has a expertise in wines The food tasted amazing and the charcuterie was varied Recommend this at all time in Menton
Really nice food and beautiful staff
Very good PUB
I like the atmosphere here and highly recommend for those who loves to drink some beer  watching sports events
They cook perfect Amazing dishes 
This is a wonderful neighborhood pub The food is very good and reasonably priced My server Oxanna was highly professional and a true delight in helping me navigate the menu with my developing Romanian language skills I will be back often
Worst burger in my life Had to wait 40 mins to get a super dry no taste hard burger Also the service was terrible the waitress has asked us several times what is our order to get a wrong one in the end Only the atmosphere and the people made it better overall I do not recommend this pub
Eat at the terrace the beer and wine are amazing food is ok the service great from the blonde happy lady
Food was very good definitely come again
good beer  food average  decent ambience
i like the location only dissatisfaction is its closes at midnight  But everything else is nice serving and the waitresses are nice and they seem to enjoy their job
Very delicious meat and tasty belgian beer It wotrh it to visit
An amazing place to go to if youre a fan of beer They have the biggest assortment of beer snacks that Ive seen in Chiinu
Overpriced place for quality of food and beer
Waiting for food for 45 minutes Icos and wape is aloud inside Smoking is not aloud The smell is horrible Do not recommend
Great food and drinks Kind and friendly staff Clean and tidy Very lovely music Definitely recommend
Best place for a big group Delicious and accessible menu 5




Simply love this place Food is great Staff mostly superb More beer would be fantastic 
Best bar in Chisinau  reminds me of a good American pub Great service food is perfect for drinking a pint Pool table in the front Spacious so never feel crowded and great view of Cathedral Park
Great pub We called in as we walking by on our way to somewhere else As it is part of a hotel we were expecting higher prices and average food but we were very pleasantly surprised We had a bottle of wine that cost only 150MDL EUR 775 and the food was fantastic and very well priced  Our waiter was very attentive polite and never let our glass get empty There is even a pool table and fosball
The greatest place where I can take a rest and eat the most delicious burger in Republic of Moldova and in the city of course You pay a good price for the best meals Always loved and recommended And the best chief
We ordered Steak in a Caucasian way and 4 Placinda double filling and the filling is really double  placindas are generously stuffed juicy and truly tasty Theyre also huge  a grown man can feel full just from eating one The steak was thick and juicy as well The prices are quite affordable  you can get more than 2kg of meaty noms for just 430 MLD The delivered food was still hot Overall the food made an excellent first impression Well be ordering again
Really good place for meat lovers They are very creative in preparing and serving meat Beef is tender and other sorts of meat are also good  They have grill sets for groups  if you take one then total youll get a bottle of home made horseradish brandy that is unbelievable Prices are very good too
Nice restaurant and pub to check in for grilled meat and breweries 
Medium standard foods but an amazing interior to hang out
You cant go wrong with Jacks The staff speak English theyre reliable quick and the food is super good for the price they charge They make the best Bloody Mary in town Highly recommend
Good place to spend the night with friends Nothing out of extraordinary or fancy Just and enjoyable place to decently eat
Large portions as advertised Trout was good but a little overcooked for my taste Mushrooms were awesome Rice was good but cold Hostess could have been friendlier Server worked hard
Live music drinks food and friends  perfect for evening gatherings
The terrace is nice and cozy The staff is friendly However the food was not amazing but it was tasty Overall it was a good experience I would visit the place again
This is a Czech chain of restaurants that creates a familiar place for Czechs Its a good standard of quality and it is quite alright here as well The food was very good the atmosphere as well menu is also in Czech The waiter was a bit confused and slow brought bread after we finished soup etc The beer they offer is Czech Kozel The place is very clean Overall I recommend it Its also in the city centre which is very convenient
I would love to rank 5 star but I could not The main reason is not about the food or beer it is about shisha You are the unique one that does not provide the service of changing carbon which make me confuse You could even charge for this service instead of let your customer keep sucking the pipe to avoid it cool down you will not like it especially when you are eating
very good draft beer and food choice Recommended
Its very close to my home Ive been here lot of time and I highly recommend
Service was None Absolutely No service Food was ok but Meter of Meat had too few pieces of veggies quarter of tomato slice of zukkini half of sweet peper one potato and onion Veggies are not expensive in Moldova Please be generous
Great pub for hanging out with friends
Super
Local beer is phenomenal  Only had 4   NY steak is also a stunner  Ordered salmon carpaccio and it also was impressive  Make sure you try the cheesecake honestly best Ive had in a very long time  Staff are very kind and helpful ambiance is great  They speak many languages in Moldova which makes things easy also  Enjoy
Nice food steak cooked perfectly how I ask just was upset because my ribeye steak on bone was exactly 1000 grams whiteout any proof and waitress dont really know romanian language and wines they have
It is a really nice and barbarian place The food is fantastic Also many unique dishes Recommend to small groups and if you wanna try something new
While in Chisinau we went here about five times Its very nice and on a beautiful road with iconic statues The Lovers also very close to Cathedral Park Sun City Mall Cat Cafe and Stephen Chel Marie Park
Beer is good but I recommend to buy by one if you take a set you may not like all of them Food is tasty
Good beer tasty food It took some time to get some dishes probably because it was crowded But I would come back to this place again
Very rare restaurants who have their own brew beer production made me curious but unfortunately nonalcoholic beer by their brand not available The food for any taste and very delicious Will come back soon
Great atmosphere with local brewed beer They have beer for all main european british tastes  German Belgian Irish Make sure to try them all and give a honest drunken opinion about how the beer should be made Extra points for cozy design Right on the main street of the capital of Moldova with the beer that you are gonna like with the food that you are going to enjoy what else do you want
I liked the place its very cozy and food is good The portraits of real legends from sports music politics etc was very good idea Will definitely visit again one Im back  With love from Belgium 
It isnt as big as you would think but its comforting the food is ok not awesome but ok the icing on the cake is that they have private rooms although with conditions but private nonetheless and with a bonus if you want a fun time with a group of friends
Good atmosphere and friendly people highly recommended
Came here at midnight and they still were able to cook Had a great time here
I didnt eat at this place I came to buy some bottles of wine The owner is very polite and customer oriented He helped me pick the wine and came with good recommendations The place looks very nice and it seems a great restaurant to have a romantic dinner
I really enjoyed the place Ordered the Wine Gogh steak and a glass of wine Both are really good The restaurant is cozy with a good atmosphere I had a nice chat with the owner He gave me some advice on wine that I want to bring home Overall a great experience I totally recommend it
The place is nice and very welcoming with a nice selection of wines but the food is a big let down  The kangaroo fillet was so hard and tough thats literally uncutable with a knife and impossible to chew potatoes soggy and the friptura didnt taste good  We werent even asked why we left more than half the food on the plates which leads to believe that they knew that what was offered is sub par Its a pity as could be a nice place but not worth the visit
Great food lovely atmosphere The Van Gogh theme throughout the place looks very pleasant to the eye The taste of the food is worthy of the higher prices for the most part
Stay away if you dont want to get ripped off 5 a pint for a picture   I purchased a picker  from here this evening  Me thinking that was for pints of lager All we got with 2 14 pints when we complained the manager tried to show me that theres actually 3 pints in a joke but when he saved if there wasnt we will not be returning customers The entertainment on couldnt even sing make it worse and I feel like we got ripped off
Great lively bar with amazing entertainment Bar staff are ace Great selection of Beer Highly recommend going for 10 drinks or more
Me and a couple of my friends decided to head down to this pub the atmosphere was amazing and the live music just made it all the more better The staff was extremely friendly and the pints were one of the best ive had their Guinness was out of this world and at an affordable price  They had a lot of TVs so we were able to watch the game even if we stepped outside for a cigarette  Overall I would definitely recommend this place
Friendly place good atmosphere and a music artist place each night And a lovely pint
Wonderful find Value prices drinks and food Had a pub meal cooked to my liking and tasty Patros friendly and loafs of fun Hosts Sharon and Michael exceptional Loved my time here and returned for a another sojourn Music to while away the evening as well
Lovely bar lots of Irish nostalgia host is friendly and will have a chat
Food brilliantFish and Chips recommended Sharon  Great hostess Good Crack amongst the locals Must visit whilst in St Pauls Area
Great bar Lovely people and atmosphere
We didnt eat or drink as we were doing a table top sale Staff are very friendly and accommodating

Warm welcome in this Irish pub full of locals Tourists welcomed Many TVs
Looking for a Scottish pub while in St Pauls its not far from waterfront but up a wee street However i think i will be making this my local everytime i come to Malta  Great barstaff very friendly place  if your here to be alone with your thoughts This place does both  Reminds me of the way pubs used to be in Glasgow Totally love it
Just come back from a week in Malta came across this bar on our first night what a fantastic little gem Andy and Anne the owners are so friendly and couldnt do enough for you We met some lovely people in there  If you like kareoke you have to go on a Sunday and Thursday and Ivan the guy who hosts is just the nicest person We didnt want to come home and we will definitely be returning soon xx Louise and Phil xxx
Great little pub Andy  Anne couldnt Do enough for us Great prices entertainment Will definitely be going back to see them Next time were in milta Which hopefully wont be too long away Andrew  davie from Edinburgh

Amazing Irish Pub with plenty of drinks and friendly environment Theyre organizing weekly events like Karaoke and live music Truly recommended
Every time we go there shut Friday night 2130 closed 13th October closed shame good bar
Dont bother turned up tonight and it was shut
We thought it was good Finger food music cheap delicious beer Good atmosphere openminded people
Great traditional pub Steve and Dawn run a fantastic pub that has all the magical ingredients Great beer and food of course with superb camaraderie amongst the regulars whether its a football match bingo or a pig roast Will return again and again Cheers Phil and Sue
Great service with a wide selection of drinks Lovely  Sunday lunch served up until 6pm  Also have options to watch your favourite team on the box  Very satisfied 
Top boozer and the Wednesday hosts were superb 
Had Sunday roast for 7 people there then breakfast for 7 people great food
Lovely little bar  pub with a good range of draft beers did not eat there but had a pint or two
We came here many times during our time in Malta The cocktails were great and the service was spot on Its also in the centre of town and shows all major football games Thanks guys
We do love the pub food and the drinks here The atmosphere is gorgeous here and they have the best cocktails Could not recommend them enough However recently we tried the sunday roast and were not impressed The portion was tiny also Such a shame we wont return for sunday lunch but definitely return for anything else 4 out of 5 due to this
Great Bar  based on AmericanIrish pub experience with very clean comfortable environment serving food and drinks  excellent friendly management and staff providing top class customer service  top quality drinks  genuine cocktails prepared by a trained mixologist  sports and music on screens and interesting memorabilia on display for entertainment
Have visited the Keys Pub every day since visiting Malta Having travelled around the island we havent found anywhere better in all honesty The staff are amazing people and genuinely make this place what it is Excellent food friendly service and being more welcoming than I could have ever imagined Regardless of where you are staying on the island visiting this establishment would certainly be a highlight of anybodys trip to Malta
The quality is like no other Hospitality is ever so inviting Stars do not give this place or the people that operate the place justice An amazing experience and forever grateful  much love and wish them all the success
Realy Nice place with good food Will be back there again sometime
LoL an old fashioned bar Local people cheap drinks open until 4am Was fun
As a big fan of Irish pubs I would say this is a top notch place Great food had Irish pride and Guinness Clean toilets Fast service and friendly staff Good location Will be back
Great place to eat drink and chill out in beautiful Irish Pub And also very reasonable prices I recommend
Friendly staff I like the atmosphere in these Pubs I had the ribs which were really good beer as well I will come again
Typical Irish bar great hospitality The Guinness is not too bad since were on  an island in the middle of nowhere Food is simple bang on  very reasonably priced which is most of Malta
Nice pub and friendly staff Perfect place to have some drinks in the evening
Great location and friendly vibes the burger is super good
Wonderful old world pubbar Food looked amazing although we only had drinks Fantastic view over the bay
Moderate place Tasted ice americano and orange juice The juice was fresh and cool however it was a bit tasteless The coffee on the other hand was just too diluted for my taste The service was also somewhat slow but the waiters were really friendly
Large English style pub with plenty of seating and a great range of drinks especially beers Good atmosphere not the friendliest of service when we visited
Great drinks and huge selection We came for an afternoon pair of drinks it was a perfect place to step away from the center of Valletta to grab a seat and relax for a moment Service was also very good
An ok UK style pub in Valletta good drinks choices basic pub grub food choices odd service  Good for sports for those that want it
Charming English style pub with a good selection of localinternational beers and spirits  The pub can get busy during peak times but you will often find a seat inside  Over the weekends there is usually live music  I have not eaten here so I cant comment on the food but it looks pretty reasonable  Would recommend a drink or two here
Excellent place a good beers and watch sports play pool and sing with karaoke 
Great to go for a good beer and listen to people singing karaoke and playing games Billiards
Very cool sports pub Cold beer good vibes  plenty screens for watching some sport
My favorite place to drink and have fun in the island If youre looking for a good atmosphere you must go to Corks Karaokes nights are the best plan you can do it 
Such a warm welcome on out first night in Malta We only popped out for some milk but needed to cool down in the heat It was like wed found our local Stefan is a master of hospitality and made us instantly welcome nothing was to much trouble Thank you for the great nights
Good pub with many kinds of beers Beers are very good and personal very kind I didnt eat therefore I cant say anything about food
Good selection of drinks nice beer Complimented the bartender for his bartending skills and he found it necessary to follow me back to the table and lecture me on him being the ownermanager and not a bartender Uncomfortable situation as he would not stop talking about it
It was a great experience  the barman is great and very kind Prize are very good they have a Irish Red ale beer thats the best I suggest this place to chill and games they infact have some games and you can use it
A lovely Place Good Beer good Food the stews are delicious tasty Cocktails friendly Service nice atmosphere
Wonderful place  large variety of drinks good rock music delicious food kind and helpful stuff And all these at fully affordable prices Recommend
Very friendly Bar with great service we booked for Sunday lunch which was a set menu roast  There were a few options for the entree and dessert We had the Soup Pasta Olio Roast Beef and Apple pie with ice cream  Everything was very fresh and lots of flavour the gravy was made from scratch  The service was so nice genuinely friendly this is where the locals go and you can tell why  Also very easy to book too we used the message service via Google
Great little sports themed gastropub nestled in the heart of Sliemas Peninsula Insulated from tourist foot traffic it was just the right amount of privacy and good eats My husband had a Cisk with the fish and chips and I had the spicy Penne All Arrabbiata and it was a delicious vegetarian option Owner was friendly and took our order personally Bathrooms were super nice and clean This place has our vote
The Pub  Is essentially a shrine to the late great actor Oliver Reed Rumour has it that he was  having a drinking competition with some British sailors and after sinking 8 pints 12 double rum and 14 whiskey he keeled over and died You can even buy a tshirt to commemorate the evening  I really wonder what this boozer was like before Oliver Reed made it famous  Anyone else been
Pub was regularly used by Oliver Reed when he was alive and in Malta  Walls covered with photos of the hell raiser himself   Definitely dedicated to Oliver  There is a folder that people can look through whilst in the pub to learn of his life in Malta  Barman was very polite and helpful Its worth a visit if you go to Malta only a small pub can be found at Archbishop Street  Seating inside and out We make a point of visiting every time we go to Malta
The Pub had so much character and charm Spent multiple evenings here  has a shrine to Oliver Reed who died here
got a beer to cheers to Oliver Reed Little nice pub with super friendly staff I went to the second floor and to the toilet after reading so many reviews mention it it is fine no smell nice sitting upstairs and restroom is totally usable cocktails were good and a perfectly served Guinness all good
Classic place If you are fortunate to be served by owner himself  Frank its just like home Great service and lots of drinks options with nibbles Cannot wait to spend more time in here again
Best Gin Tonic in town Chef loves Rod Steward Absolut Champion
Cisk beer didnt taste good smelled bad and had bits in it I wouldnt recommend
Great pub locals enjoying life and cheap beer Cash only and toilets are full of surprises 
We had a Serbian waitress who couldnt care less  sour face and poor customer service  The pizza was nice and the burger was ok but wouldnt go back there again
A wonderful sports bar with a great range of drinks available Reasonably priced and with attentive and friendly staff The live band acts are pretty decent too If you want to enjoy a drink in a lively bar you cant go wrong with the Black Gold bar
We didnt do the food but the drinks were 5 star  Great service too  With many MANY screens this would be a terrific place to watch a World Cup
We watched the Rugby World Cup in large groups We had the most amazing experience their team accommodated and served us so well  Great spot affordable with a nicevibe
Been a few times now Always enjoyed the food and great service Today I took creamy chicken with pasta but try the fish and chips super crispy as a Englishman I miss the mushy peas  Friendly  fast and clean
Great food great service and git to chat with the owner Ron who was just wonderful Off the menu fresh fish as well
What a lovely place to lunch or dine The waitress was so friendly and helpful I think her name was Alba Quietly away from the hustle and bustle of Valletta yet still in town
a friendly and nice Pub with a good Open Air area The service personal is friendly and helpful The food is very tasty Thanks for the nice evening in valetta
The perfect spot for socialising and having a good time together Its a super cosy place ideal for organising a personal event or joining in for one of their many events happening Cool people hanging around Highly recommended 
A little out of the way this is a small bar with friendly staff and customers  It seems to cater for the locals more than anything else The decor is dark which does not add to the the appeal We came looking for Karaoke and found it done in a quirky way put your name and song on a sheet and wait the karaoke just runs along with no host so if you go to the toilet or for a smoke you could miss your turn Worth a visit if you passing
Great place we were treated to some lovely live music by 2 brilliant guitarists when we went there The music is quite loud so not the best place for deep conversation but its a great place to kick back have a drink and enjoy the music Unfortunately I feel like I have to dock it a point as the interior is no longer the same as in pics in other reviews While the atmosphere is still quite nice theres almost none of the rock n rollvinyl decorations that give so much character Still highly recommended
What a great experience friendly crowd although a lot younger than we are but a really nice vibe
This place makes the best coffee in Malta and it doesnt cost the earth Discovered it yesterday looking for another shop near Spinola Bay No pretensions just friendly service and damn good coffee I am told that the sandwiches there are pretty good too
Simply the best still the Maltese snack place i remember as a young lad No fancy prices but the food is great Great place to meet up with friends I highly recommend it
My favourite restaurant in Malta Wordless I fell in love with this bar having lunch every days during my stay in Malta Great location cheap price and delicious food specially ftiras of tuna and gbejna chicken curry rice chicken pesto raviolli and chicken wrap Typical and authentic Maltese bar
Locals favorite little bar They have kitchen as well so are serving warm food most of them typical Maltese options Good to relax and enjoy the sun Area is quiet busy so there is always something to look up for They have 3 screens so if you are a football fan they will be streaming live events Tonys Bar  legend
Could have been the best pub experience in Malta Original interior great view and friendly staff First time I had the best burger in Malta using the Craft Your Own Burger option My wife had a very nice Chilly con carne The second time the burger was awful The meat wasnt fresh and it was overcooked until completely dry So not consistent and you never know what youll get
The Crafty Cat was just a short walk from out apartment so our group of 5 went in 2 or 3 times over a long weekend Nice and relaxed atmosphere decor is pretty cool We ate there twice and both times food was brilliant Especially the veggie burger and IPA cheese chips And obviously the great selection of beers on tap or cansbottles in the fridge was also brilliant Service was a always friendly and fast too Great place
Small pub but the design is so cool Food is good altough im not a big fan of cajun pepper and thats the chilli they use But on the whole it was a great night and I loved the avocado chips and the beers The onion rings where also amazing
Unique decorations and theme The food is amazing plenty of choices also vegetarian and affordable There is a good variety of drinks as well The staff has been absolutely amazing every single time we are there always super nice thoughtful and quick I literally dont have anything bad to say I love it here
Love this little pub Staff are so friendly and have a great variety of drinks A place my wife has visited many times with her family Still the same family that own it Cant wait to come back
The good old place A unique bar restaurant with the traditional Maltese approach Overall it is a nice place to enjoy some evenings in winter more likely The owner is friendly and approachable Theres a notable selection of spirits and the decoration takes you back to older times
A very nice little pub Gigantic well furnished friendly people and not overcrowded with teenagers  To be recommended unreservedly
Would give more than 5 points if it was possible Small pub Very friendly people and friendly barman too Awesome selection of drinks
Exactly what you would expect from a place like this Staff is very friendly and the place is perfect for a low cost night out Wraps and sandwiches are very tasty for munchies and the beer portfolio is quite extensive Only downside is that if you dont smoke and wish to have a discussion with your group the music is crazy loud But I guess if you want to do that at 1am you can find somewhere more quiet for that
Amazingly artistic and genuinely good cocktails Found everyone really friendly and very attentive when articulating what we did or didnt like in cocktails so made them to perfection Great music and really cool venue Will be going back for sure
Beautiful speakeasy bar friendly owner and stuff tasty cocktails
Stunningly decorated place showing the era of The Order of the Knights of Malta Totally charming This is by far the most impressive pub Ive ever seen
Honestly one of the best veggie burgers Ive ever had The portions are huge all the burgers come with skin on fries So good I highly recommend Also the staff were super friendly and a great service is always a plus
Definitely my best gastrobar experience in Malta so far The food was very good and the service was excellent 
My favourite burger place  The food the ambiance the service all make this place such a welcoming place to grab a bite or have a few drinks The friendly staff and homely vibe make it all the more special and add to the down to earth atmosphere
Best Burgers nachos and SERVICE in all Malta LOVED IT
Clubby atmosphere we were there in the evening with loud music and a tv  football being played A bit difficult to talk to one another but you could manage without shouting  Giving only 3 stars as cocktails were not great very sugary They were also serving craft beer
Decent prices and nice staff The food was good We didnt think it was anything spectacular The calamari was ok The ribs were tender and flavorful The fish  chips were okay in my opinion I was hoping for a little more breading on them the fish was big and definitely worth the price for the size The breading wasnt as good as other places I have been to But I am not at all a critic for that as Im not British
A taste of home As soon as we arrived the staff were very accomodating Getting to sit and see the world go by whilst we took advantage of their happy hour cocktails buy an extra one for 1 The main food was just to die for cooked to perfection Really tasty Couldnt put it down Would have licked the plate clean if it was allowed The thing that disappointed was the dessert It was supposed to be a Snickers dessert but it tasted bland honestly didnt feel like eating a Snickers at all Very disappointed in the desserts considering the main was to die for There were way too many cocktails mind to choose from and only picked 3 But could have easily drank all day there
very kind staff and great cocktails we tried the fish and chips and sausage as well they were tasty as well
This is a very lovely bar The beer offer is amazing so many types and brands including the Malta special The design is fun and cool  But the best part is the bartender girl who was very friendly
Came here for a visit a few times while visiting Malta Had an Amazing time being served by Laura the best bartender known in town  recomending to everyone 
We stopped for a few Fizzies on a quiet night Only 3 other customers and the staff member was very friendly and polite
This is a very nice bar thematic where youll find the magic universe of Alice in Wonderland wherever you look Paints draws and a great mural combined with the right low lights Wide variety of drinks and beers Great place to meet people and have fun 
Very bad place its located near the main street Homeless people always are bothering the guests and the staff doesnt do nothing about it Last time I was there a girl was attacked by a homeless person after she called the waiter on him The waiter or none of the staff did nothing abiut the situation Terrible experience I highly recommend not going there unless you want to fight a homeless person
Two to three people working at this place and manage to ignore empty glasses and drinks more than 25 minutes Imagine the money they could make when spending less time with chatting and surfing on the mobile
Was there several times I also managed to assist to a couple of nice live shows great atmosphere Also one of the best whisky sour in the city it can be addictive If you have appetite for junkfood also nachos are worth a shot they are the definition of comfort food associated to some heavy drink Just one thingthe place is small and gets crowded easily during events but thats also part of its charm in a certain way
Not badbut workers can look weird if they understand youre foreign 
I just had to leave a review about how great the burgers are at this small pub Its worth the short walk from downtown to get one of this guys jalapeo cheeseburgers My pic is not that great but the burger was outstanding I also got a side mixed salad of shredded beets carrots and cabbage to balance out the nutrition and it was huge and came with a tasty light dressing  Great beer selection and very reasonable prices too Friendly owner will help you choose beers if you ask Go here
the pub has a very cozy and relaxed vibe with really great and affordable food and drinks as well the staff were all super friendly and attentive there is both indoor and outdoor seating i highly recommend you to give this place a try
Nice pub good choice of craft both draft and bottle beer huge tasty meals
Large selections of beers from Germany Czech and UK Friendly staff that are good in recommending you a beer according to your taste Awesome wings and tornado potatoes
Nice and cozy place sometimes may be crowded but has space too And the prices are reasonable And basic music for the weekends
Great selection of beers poor food quality
Elegant environment friendly and fast service wide variety of beers at affordable prices and plenty choise in the snacks menu They should increase the toilette hygiene at top notch level though worthy of the bar itself Overall  worth a visit for beer fans
I went there because a friend decided to celebrate her birthday there and was pleasantly surprised The place is pretty nice cozy atmospheric and had a band play live which really set the mood All in all a great experience
Great little pub difficult to find but we had a couple of great nights here
Great atmosphere with amazing acoustic bands Pleasant and affordable prices The staff is friendly and cheerful always ready to make your day with a chat or drinks Its a must to visit on weekends wether youre local or a tourist
Amazing food and atmosphere Plenty of interesting people to talk to and have fun The prices are normal and the drinks are great
Really cool bar with a love music area but also a sit down and chill out area if you want a bit of peace and quiet Decent selection of beers including bottles of the fine local brew Skopsko at a very reasonable price Trends to be a younger crowd and gets very busy later on especially on Friday and Saturday nights but all ages are made to feel welcome If you like classic rock then this is a must visit bar of you find yourself in Skopje I look forward to getting back again in the future
So nice love the people in the bar
One of the best pubs Ive been in in Skopje Amazing atmosphere and very good food 
Awesome place for watching sports games Delicious chiken fingers as a combo for the cold beer
Great pub and very friendly service Good vibes for good nights Cheers 
Strange and oldfashioned rule no omelette after 1200 AMridiculous So we were forced to order lunch menu sandwiches and salads I am still curious why this kind of menus in small bistro like this oneps food was so and so
Great place cozy and warm home like atmosphere with great food and excellent service and huge variety of beer and cocktails
Best pub in the city worth visiting Surrounded by the warmest people which will make you wnjoy the evening even more
One of the best loungebars has great food and service ton of options and friendly workers The only thing that made me put a 4 star rating is the prices of the menu they are a bit pricy but still in a good range Id say
It was so popular place its a shame in what a condition  it is now a place with charme and  authenticity I really hope someone will do somethingmeaning a little to be  invested in restoration
Nice atmosphere and good drinks
Fun karaoke on Saturday night but few employees so a wait for drinks when it is crowded
If you are in Skopje and 40 The one of the Best night places 
From the



The first time we could not find and had to come back It is a bit hatd to find inside a local neighborhood It is a nice place to chiil out have some beers with classical rock music The night we were there there was a accoustic live music and we enjoyed a lot The beer prices are reasonable
Best atmosphere worst or weirdest service Today as its Sunday night we asked when they close and learned they are open till 12am so we started to enjoy the venue around 7pm  My friend prefered a quiet corner I sat at the bar after having my beer i talked the other 2 people sitting near about the local spirits and beers they were regulars and gave me some advices  The bartender was not behind the bar she was going inside and out After the guys on bar left the place mine beer was empty the bartender were going in and out there were a total of 4 customers at the place two were us others were at balcony she were like pretending im a ghost and waited her to stop for a while at the bar for around 15 minutes sitting at the bar with empty glass  12 times she stared at me for a second and when i want to speak she rushed to the kitchen or out  I asked her was it a wrong time to visit the place she said its sunday and went I told her was ghosting me and i cannot order and she smiled and went again  I told my friend my friend is a girl  in case anyone thinks she didnt want to be alone with me in the venue we also didny have any conversation other than ordering our drinks i didnt have anything weird a long haired metalhead being in a rock bar having positive conversation with the couple on the bar to pay the bill and go I mentioned my frustration to be the only one in the place and couldnt order for around 2030 mins to the bartender and she just said its sunday i paid and left the venue  the place was so well designed it was our only night at skopje they were playing led zeppelin i havent drink kozel dark for months and i was keen on enjoying the venue and my time  but it happened to be a disasterous approach and i have never seen such an absurd ghosting to a customer without a reason
Fantastic place great atmosphere
Great bar Good music and you can meet there other foreigners The guy working there is cool and he takes care of you You can try different beers and pelinkovac Its anyway not touristic so do not expect so many people
Went here 2 times both of the times their draft wasnt working and they didnt actually have any craft beers only the local beers bottled We ordered the traditional plate which didnt contain any olives like they advertised the yellow cheese tastes like nothing and the bread was to terribly we had to send it back Luckily the kitchen agreed and gave us different free bread I just dont understand how they couldve send this bread out to us and were somehow expecting us to enjoy it Also the owner or someone else working there was so rude and inconsiderate that the was moving tables and hurt my arm and someone else working there had to apologize to me Sad case cause the waitress was actually very very nice but we didnt leave a tip just because the food and other workers were obviously less than acceptable Honestly wouldnt recommend Not with that many other good bars around Rakjija bar
This place apparently had some home brewed beer which was absolutely horrible I give it another opportunity when theyve changed the keg but it was still disgusting They also serve bottled beer Skopsko which was OK There was this musician on lousy tuned guitar who desperately tried to impress bunch of Italians but it turned out tragicomic as he sang Italian songs in gibberish besides 23 words that he had managed to remember He was funny though The toilet Lets suppose it is educational as you learn the inner workings of how it gets flushed The terrace looks nice and the location is nice The waitress was nice as well
It has a very nice atmosphere They brew their own beer and food is excellent Prices are reasonable Make sure to stop by when visiting Skopje Highly recommend
No trace of artisan beers on tap There is only one which isnt good and very expensive compared to the general prices of the city The music is the best about this pace
Service is alright drinks are nice and the aesthetics are amazing But the bands and singers are awful loud and dont sound good at all They should start hiring better singers or stop live music all together
Barman should star listening to orders instead of just making what he thinks is good I ordered cold machiato and he made me warm one and try to explain that that is the one i want
The best local pub in Aerodrom Small cute with very good service Marija is very positive smiling face with very polite behaviours and soft attitude Very good choice
Good solid place to have a drink or two The outdoor area looks quite cool Service was not too bad either
Horrible service Got me the wrong food then refused to give me right one
Its cool to hang here Cheap But its not a big place so 4 stars is kinda a good rating so there


If you are non smoker forget about it there is smoke of cigaretts everywhere awful smell evrywhere
The best pizza and cool atmosphere  a vast selection of beer and whiskey Mortadela pistachio is a must try 
Groove place Spacious A lot of plants Different music every day Great pizza Friendly owners
the best in the city
My forever favourite bar Strong rock and roll vibe Excellent variety of drinks for affordable prices I highly recommend this place
In my opinion the best bar in Aerodrom by far Great music chill vibes and good prices The music can be a bit loud so if youre looking for a place to chat probably best to go somewhere else Otherwise would definitely recommend
Pub with nice service Beers which are the most popular in Macedonia are available Skopsko Amstel and Dab They also have choice of German beers Good rock music
Nice place to hang out with friends anytime in the day



Very nice place with great icecream and good drinks 
Drinking the best freddo espresso and the atmosphere is so beautiful and lazy

We had some of the best and tastier cocktails ever here Thanks especially to Martin the bartender who attended to our every need and was really helpful and friendly Thanks for a great night
An amazing place they always have fantastic coctails great atmosphere all the time tegardless if its warm or cold Last time we visited my friend and I had a blast and we got bonus coctails on the house If you love unique drinks this place is a must see
Chill atmosphere  good location  1010 would visit again
Came here for a drink in the evening We paid 400 MKD for a beer and Aperol Spritz Vibe was trendy and relaxed with good music The staff spoke English
Nice atmosphere and music  The drinks are good and pretty affordable too  The service was good too 
Nice place in popular Debarmaolo coffee bars district   exceptionally friendly staff
The coffe tasted salty  the staff was very judgy
We ordered more than 2 hours ago and the food has still not arrived Absolutely terrible service and inhuman treatment of customers Wish I could give 0 stars
Its my go to place I love it there Its usually not much people its quiet and atmosphere is awesome The soups are very very tasty and very affordable Staff is friendly 5 out of 5 I consider this my go to place and I wouldnt change it I feel very comfortable there I would totally recommend it The menu is awesome there is descent choice for vegetarians as well Tasty food friendly staff and good atmosphere  55 
Good place Has food and drinks sometimes live music  not in the center but definitely a good getaway from there  it is like in a mall on the ground floor it has a big smoking area
Small place inside huge outside seating area  Always crowded Not perfect but ok place to chill Good price on food and frinks
Good pub with table service even in offseason it was pretty full Prices are good They have live music performances at least in the weekends when i was there a band was playing national and international hits Recommended for a visit in Ohrid
beautiful design inside a bit dark from the veranda there is a view of the Ohrid Lake prices are a little higher than usual there is a choice of food drinks beer but nothing surprised me a lot of space
A nice place in Ohrid that serves coffee beer drinks and food Warm in the winter with nice music Also there is tv where you can watch foodball The food was nice as the beers a nice variety of beers Normal prices and the staff helpful kind and quick service Theres also the ability to park in front Overall a must in Ohrid PS the toilets could be a little bit cleaner
First of all the ambient and the atmosphere were good the music was not so loud and everyone could listen to it We were waiting for the food for about 1h 15mins for 2 club sandwiches because there was lack of plates and service When we got our food it was cold and was not as we expected to be Could be better experience for such famous place in its Town
Nice lounge bar for drinks and shisha Good atmosphere and music They have different shisha flavors a shisha costs 500 denar The girl from the bar was very friendly we had good and fast service
Lovely little place with a lot of things to offer Managers are always ready to jump in and save the situation Deserts are the number one alongside the coffees they make
Very long waiting time even for them to just hand you the menu Food isnt too bad but it depends on what you order NEVER order the chicken fingers
The staffs attitude was awful He let us to wait too long and when he came instead of excusing he started arguing with us in a very rude way I dont think that ill go there anymore



Take a longe time to servis here o dont like servis everything else is ok but servis no
If u go in struga dont miss to visit this place amazing staff and excelent atmosphere
Very good food and nice ambient Good prices too
Perfect place wonderful people
Nice and cozy place in Veles They have good food and the staff is friendly Order the hamn and cheese rolls and enjoy the taste Goes perfectly with Skopsko Friendly staff
The best Irish pub I have ever been at The food is 1010
Nice and decent place a clean one where you can have a very good pizza beer or other beverages or various dishes and salads A placeto meet your friends
It is an interesting place where drink  food can be quality combined Beer is good they have draft and craft beer Pica  I will recommend the DaVinchi
Great place Very authentic the staff and owners are very friendly and pleasant
Great rock place Recommend
Great staff Fluent English
Great place Nice music
Nice place probably cozy atmosphere but the fking music was turned up to 11 Couldnt even hear my own thoughts much less the others I was out and about with tonight
You can choose from all different types of coffee my favorite is Bicerin  Nutella Ice coffee and if you like cocktails this is the place Favorite place to be
Sweet menu 
Great placegreat staffamazing drinks and cocktail s
Called for a pint while waiting for a bus Thoroughly unpleasant barman unless youre his mate or Irish I suppose It  looks like a building that someone squatted in and opened  a rather shabby pub It smells awful Top tip invest in air freshener It was raining but I was reluctant to go inside it was that bad
Whiskey was smooth best taken neat  Lively place though a bit quiet for Karaoke night in the summer
Special night on every alternate Monday Im so lucky to be there on such a special night Lots of fun and bunch of games
Great food Great drinks Great service
A pub of personality clearly a popular place to let your hair down Unfortunately they didnt serve Boff but alas one cannot be picky If youre a fan of sports then I recommend you sit down with a cool pint and enjoy the entertainment
Well this bar was amazing The music was great in the city centre near to the bus station this bar has everything Pool football table darts sofas comfortable sits and a good range of beers The atmosphere was very nice We had a good time in there I recommend this pub
Good place for after work drinks Very popular Fair prices for the Luxembourg Central business district
Small pub strategically located in the Hamilius bus and tram stops Really nice to have a beer while waiting for the bus
Great fresh Guinness served inside and outside Nice atmosphere Fireplace live sports TV Specialty evenings
Always friendly service from the staff Cosy inside and super patio for sunny days and most of the best sports on tv available
Few colleagues suggested this as I was looking for an Irish pub They have great Guinness live music at least on Fridays  I havent been there any other day of the weekweekend the staff is super pleasant and they serve a couple of options for a bite tacos cheese bread olives etc It doesnt get super busy and its a great spot for after work drinks after a busy week
I loved the atmosphere and the friendliness of the staff Having lived in Ireland it was great discovering this place plus it is one of the only place outside of Ireland that has cider on draft I would definitely recommend going there
A good choice of beer on tap On thursday you have two for the price of one happy hour  Unfortunately the service is slow and the music is far too loud  I like loud music but not at 6pm when there is nobody in the pub
The worst place ever They will charge you more than in menu as they did with me And at the exit show you fcks just because you asked why  We met the owner or admin who was a nice guy but this specific barmen and security guy are so unprofessional would never recommend and we will never return
The stuff literally said to go fk our selfs  just because we asked why they charged us extra 1 euro for each drink cus 11 euro for a cup of beer seems pricey for Lux and at the exit both barmens showed me fks I was sober civil and polite Hope they will be fired at least And I will tell about this and to never go there  all over internet and to everyone I know Zero respect And I was with friends who visited Luxembourg for the first time This is what they saw We are offended and would never recommend going there
Nice Irish pub with a big space inside and a huge balcony Theres a nice selection of beers and service is good My last visit was during the St Patricks day and the place was crowded with very young people max 20 years old The music was electronic and probably directed to the young audience Thats not a problem at all just not my style
Best veggie burger of all time and scrumptious French fries Great atmosphere as well ideal to sit outside and get lost in the beautiful lower city scenery
Good selection of beers Tasty food prices are very affordable considering location I ordered sausage and beer it was 8 Very pleasant atmosphere
Fries and drinks were good We got jalapeo burger it was really spicy  and I like it but meat inside burger was not juicy
Very good burger and nice comedy standup events on Thursdays
How can they offer nice drinks and good beer at reasonable prices in the middle of expensiveish Luxembourg Nice service as well
We had a company event a few weeks ago and the experience was TOP  From the first moment while we were arranging with Markus for the service we knew we took the right decision to book the White Rose He attended all of our requests  On the day of the event Markus was alone to serve all of us Nevertheless it felt like he was working with 2 more people No delays no problems Everything was on time
Good draft Guiness and gorgeous cocktails Also best service EVERRR
Beer selection and service are outstanding 
I recently visited this pub and had an absolutely dreadful experience that I feel compelled to share I sincerely advise everyone to steer clear of this establishment due to its numerous flaws  Firstly the bartenders behavior was beyond unprofessional and downright rude Not only did they exhibit a complete lack of courtesy but they also engaged in racist behavior towards my friends This was unacceptable  Additionally the prices of the drinks were outrageously high considering their mediocre quality A cider which should be a refreshing and reasonably priced beverage cost a whopping 9 The exorbitant pricing coupled with the underwhelming taste left a bitter aftertaste metaphorically speaking  To make matters worse the pub was unbearably hot inside It was as if they had forgotten to turn on the air conditioning or simply didnt care about the comfort of their patrons We were left sweating and uncomfortable throughout our entire visit which certainly did not enhance our already disappointing experience  Overall I strongly discourage anyone from visiting this place The combination of an unprofessional and racist bartender overpriced drinks and an uncomfortably hot environment make this place a complete letdown Save your time and money by seeking out better alternatives in the area
My favorite place in town for watching football on the weekend Be mindful theres no food but they give you peanuts to munch on
Helpful staff and wide beer selection Highly recommend going here if youre in Luxembourg Also bonus theres lots of parking on the street and across the street Only 6 in the parking lot if youre looking to park all day
Great pub to watch a bit of football on the TV  Have a Toastie and a beer  The owner Graham is a thorough gentleman and a great host 
Third opening for Shamrock Great location for afterworks Every Thursday they do buy1 get1for free on drinks Good beer selection There are few screens to watch sport 1 football table and 1 pool table 2
Very simple no nonsense bar good beer selection and lots of people after work
Third bar of this amazing chain Great beer on tap and beer nice staff Great addition in Kirchberg district It has darts pool foosball On the negative side it has very few tables given the size of the place They have happy hour on Thursdays
Lovely pub but there is often no rock music
I visited this cafe with a friend and we had a great time The host was simply amazing very friendly and welcoming We were made to feel like we were regulars even though it was our first time there The decor was also very appealing creating a warm and inviting atmosphere Highly recommend this cafe to anyone who want to enjoy good vibe
Very pleasant place  Very nice staff didnt speak english but thats okay
Best service in all Luxembourg Great music great drinks and the sweetest person youll ever meet in your life Must go
A very friendly place with a lot of spirit
Very welcoming and accommodating staff Very friendly Good food Good beer Would recommend
Nice neighborhood place Cosy Good food
An English pub at its finest  Step in and enjoy your time  English beer granted  We went to this pub because we had a reservation for the back area for an event  The entire service with drinks some snacks salad fries was flawless
The owner should be less avaricious and put more personnel in place The poor lady attending has to prepare the drinks meals attend the customers and telephone Not fair for her
Race weekend so I had to Google where to watch Formula 1 and came across to this pub Had a great time Vibes are good Staff is amazing Beer is good Food is also great
Nice stuff Guinness on tap between a sports bar and a classic pub with traditional and more modern interior elements Good burgers interesting choices with more than your classic bacon and cheese
This is a wonderful little bar to stop by for a few drinks and have a chat with the locals The bartender was very friendly and was happy to chat with us about life in the city Drinks are also priced very well
Nice Place Went there twice in a Rowe because we felt welcomed here Nice Music  if your into metalrock its tidy and nice Thanks 
The portions were HUGE My family got a rib rack for 2 but it couldve easily fed 4 Me and my friend ordered the kimchi sandwiches which were also gigantic and surprisingly spicy I usually dont expect too much from bar food but this was definitely to be recommended
We just stopped here on our way back to the Hotel It is a nice place in a nice atmosphere We just eat a small snack in this case some french fries which where made from fresh potatoes Quite nice
This place is amazing We had Scott Burger and draft beer Staff was attentive and food was great as well
Food  we ordered Scotts xl burger and chicken piri piri and we relished both the dishes aScotts xl burger  The double charcoaled grilled beef patty was cooked to perfection  juicy tender and flavorsome b Chicken piri piri  delicious chicken glazed with chili oil was very appetizing My Indian palate thanked me for having it  French fries that came along both the dishes were amazing and different from what you usually get in other places The fries were very crispy 4 stars and not 5 as the menu options were limited during our time of visit Service  Friendly service Ambiance  chill and cool We couldnt get a table overlooking the water body but I am sure that its an experience to dine there
Went here for dinner on the patio to share small plates Everything was really tasty Wetried the lamb chops burger sliders olives and hummuseverything was very tasty Great flavor
The food was really good the portions are big The cocktails are unique and taste yummy
Food was good nothing too fancy just nice food
A nice place with great potential but lazy and incompetent staff except for the one lady who was doing her best to serve everyone and kept on a smile while the others were nowhere to find The place was full and there was only one waitress serving everyone which sucks because it shows that not all the staff care about their job Theyre just there doing  nothing leaving customers and the poor lady jumping from a table to another  Very disappointing I would only go back if everyone would have the same work ethics as that lady
A good rock bar in Luxembourg Visit their facebook page for the events you dont want to miss em Oh by the way Battin Triple is my favorite all around
Nice place but it would be nicer if they didnt play music downstairs during concerts
I am visiting luxembourg and wanted to visit this place and see the live band playing on Friday However they did not let me in because they dont accept credit cards for tickets Come on we are in 2023 No one will carry cash anymore  Note they accpet credit cards for drinks but not ticket which make it weirder
I have been in every single country in Europe so I can say that this is the best bar in the continent Everything is great from the bar staff to the DJ to the security guy to the regular customers to the dancers If I was living in Luxembourg I would be here every week since I live in the Netherlands I have to resort to my monthly trips 7 hours each way by train And it is always worthy You might enter by yourself but you will never feel alone Rock Box will welcome you give you a hell of a night and make you come back again I have just left the bar and I am already looking forward the next visit This is my favourite place and it will be your favourite as well if you give it a try See you there
Fine place to eat Staff very friendly Relaxed atmosphere Bit small and narrow inside Proper free WiFi Thai Curry was tasty Ribs were equally tasty Not the best ever but good enough
Fish and Chips and steak were super delicious  1380 for each dish  Pretty good price and located in the old town They also can give you tap water to save some money for drinks   great option for people from Eastern Europe   Lovely place 
Lovely patio for lunch I had the salmon cakes and they were delicious Crispy on the outside Flavorful Really well prepared
We enjoyed a relaxed pubstyle  lunch here Great burgers and wraps The chilli con carne was also good Polite friendly service
Lovely fresh food Excellent friendly service Highly recommended
Had lunch with colleagues Nice food and ambience
Awsome music and atmosphere super nice and helpful waiter who was a highlight of the stay And food is to die for Perfectly seasoned and you just melt with every bite Highly recommended
Waiting staff were delightfully friendly and welcoming With my poor French and the Waiters better English we had a great time puzzling through translating different choices on the menu  For 20 the dish of the day and either a starter or dessert was very good value  The Plat de Jour was prawns with sauteed carrots and wild rice was perfectly cooked The duck chosen by my partner was a masticatory workout but none the less one that had the tastebuds smiling  Nutella souffle for dessert was decadent and finished off a very reasonably priced meal  This place is to be recommended
Delicious Iberico ribs and the seafood platter even though a little oily Fast service and friendly staff Cosy ambience Advisable to reserve especially for dinner
Very beautiful place and the plates come with generous amounts of food The staff was very friendly and ready to help
Nice afterwork Spanish tapas restaurant and bar Its part of a big group in Luxembourg city The place is warm we went on Monday evening not crowded it was very cool There are several cocktails and tapas so good ingredients to spend a good evening
The noise background inside isnt well designed food is ok nothing special  Its not possible to get some normal cream for coffe
Undercooked raw mushrooms inbetween of chicken breast and melted cheese  25 eur for rasin dry fries  Shame
Great place to visit and enjoy a beer with a cozy view of Vilnius streets
As a person who has never given a review I have had the desire to review a Pub for the first time since yesterday evening Not in a good way I have never experienced such unfriendly bartenders in my life We were a sports group that wanted to celebrate a victory everything was in good conditions and we were treated unfriendly ignored when we wanted to order eyes rolled no sign of hospitality It was also not possible to add everything to one invoice the staff was poorly organized and annoyed which created more chaos with orders and payments There was also a little Peanutgate huge drama about peanuts that HAVE TO BE PAID DIRECTLY BY CARD Waitress was annoyed that there were people standing at the bar and she had a hard time getting through and your colleagues too  Sorry wrong job choice Ive been wondering all the time whether the business idea is to not make any money and scare people away and hope they dont stay long It was a Sunday and a very friendly group of women came to your pup the normal logic is today is a good business evening BUT NO not in this pup very unfortunate not recommended 
Very pleasant place we proposed to the bartender to prepare a cocktail which wasnt on the menu and he accepted without hesitation The prices are very attractive and the basement with the billard is a plus Well come again on our next trip 
Very nice place to grab some beer
Nice place and friendly prices Unique selfservice bar Recommend to visit 
Great place we go there regularly for a beer or take a couple of bottles home I like the concept  you take a card pour yourself a beer using this card and then pay its convenient I had a small question about beer thanks to Thomas  thanks to him the issue was resolved
Great bar Cozy quick service nice beer and wine possibility to take take away fresh beer 
A great modern craft beer place with delicious foods and snacks See their menu on their website On tap for the most part  local brewery Belike and polish options  brewery Pinta And other beers on a shuffle A couple of beer fridges with more craft beers in cans and bottles again mostly Poland beers some belgium and others Food is delicious tasty looking portions I highly recommend jelapeno bombs Not kidding 3 huge jelapeno poppers wrapped in bacon covered in cheese coated in crumbs deep fried served with local sauce  unique and all time favorite Order by the bar Tip of choice with each card payment Cashless If i remember right they have a few board games More space upstairs Toilets on both floors Parking is public the street is narrow
Great place we popped in here for the last drinks of the night out and were not disappointed Great atmosphere good choice of drinks and simple but delicious snacks
I have tried several beers from the tap  every suprised me with awesome taste Also one wheat beer can from fridge And burger with fries and Dedes souce delicous Thank you Laura for good service
Unexpected but very cool venue We were on our way to another craft beer bar when we passed in front of it and we recognized the PINTA polish craft brewery stickers on the outside glass so we popped in They have a very wide selection of polish craft beer from the top breweries like pinta browar stu mostow funky fluidas well as some Lithuanian beers 910 taps great vibe and nice staff Dont forget to also check the fridge in the corridor
Nice pub located in the old town A lot of sports shown on big screens good selection of beers and snacks
Great bar a little hard to get served when busy but an overall good vibe Try out their spicy wings theyre pretty tasty and come in 3 heat choices get all three The only gripe is that the wings themselves are pretty small but overall I would recommend it Also they show sport if thats what youre looking for
Popular bar in the heart of downtown Dont let the name fool you this is definitely a diverse crowd with tons of locals and foreigners alike Whether its the start of your night or the end you want to include this establishment on your list
My favorite pub in Vilnius They have a good variety of beers good rhums and tasty cocktails They also have a long food menu with different snack and meals starting from wings poutine or burger I strongly recommend the double cheeseburger which is one the best burger I had in Vilnius And last but not least they have the best saltibarciai in town Not joking its by far the best cold beetroot soup in Vilnius Inside they have TVs playing sport most of the time Its a good place to watch F1 or some football games Staff is really cool and speak English perfectly
We ordered by the QR code from the table in the comments to the dish it was added that the dish should be without salad and coke with ice None of this was included unfortunately the fries soaked in vinaigrette sauce Drinking glasses was dirty only plus was good chicken and short waiting time for food
One of the best bars in Vilnius Very tasty Lithuanian food big portions and cheap food You can find very good locally brewed beer Cozy environment big terrace outside
Interesting place Love their bar with stone leg rests Helpful staff speaking English too And lovely outdoor area courtyard outside shared with another restaurant
One of my favourite places in the city since the first days I started living in Vilnius more than ten years ago Extremely friendly polite and professional staff Very tasty hearty Lithuanian food in copious portions Locally brewed beer and not only that Unpretentious cozy environment The owners are the sweetest and nicest people ever Their game room is to die for Their trivia nights are a hoot Highly recommend both for a tourist and a local
Usually Im not a big fan of bars but I really enjoyed this one The food and drinks are pretty good great service and cozy atmosphere Ill definitely come there again Be ready sometimes it could be crowded
A great place for any occasion  Friendly and caring people delicious food cozy atmosphere  I recommend stopping by for lunch or coming for a fullfledged vacation at Grand Resort Vilnius  Swimming pools spas play areas comfortable rooms  everything is in place 
My third time here  Cold beetroot soup is amazing 
Really good sports bar for the ol footie Food is really good nice taste and great portions
Best bar Ive ever been to Really good food and amazing tiki cocktails If you love soul food rum and classic 90s hip hop youll love this place too Also shoutout to the new server who had her first day there today you were great
Very nice place to hanging out for a drink or eat burgers or appetizers All is decorated american style in a very stylish way There is also a dj during the evening and they broadcast some sport event ufc basket bal etc
Uncle Sams American Pub is a hidden gem located in the heart of Vilnius Surrounded by neighboring bars and clubs this pub stands out for its unique and eyecatching design The moment I walked in I was immediately impressed by the intriguing neon signs and the fullfledged food track The central bar in particular caught my attention with its outstanding design made by beer draft handles  its a truly cool and creative idea  The entire place is full of character and wonderful design ideas making it the perfect spot for a night out with friends The atmosphere is lively and inviting and the staff is friendly and attentive The beer selection is impressive and I was especially impressed by the quality and taste of the food The finger food was extraordinary and I particularly enjoyed the pubs signature dishes  The price was also reasonable and I found the overall value to be excellent I was particularly impressed with the quality of service as the staff was always happy to make recommendations and ensure we had a great time  Overall my experience at Uncle Sams American Pub exceeded any kind of pub expectation Its now my goto place whenever Im in the city center and I cant wait to go back and try more of the menu I highly recommend this pub to anyone looking for a unique and memorable experience Whether youre a local or a tourist Uncle Sams American Pub is a mustvisit destination
Had a great time hereeating and drinkingfun locals and good atmosphere Staff are frienly 
Really good stuff Cool people and a special place
Really cool late bar in Vilnius nice staff and a cosy environment near the centre
Cozy warm and welcoming pub in the center of Vilnius One of the best of its kind Recommend this place for a visit solo or in a group If welcomed by the bartender Aleksandras  ask for The Bloody Mary  his signature drink known for its spicyness and delicacy from Klaipda to Vilnius Again recommend this place 55
The place is nice Bigger crowd closer to weekend during week days its quite chill Got foosball game Id advise booking in advance on weekends
Great bar We had a beer 500ml and a wine which cost us 10 euros Great bar staff who worked very hard serving many people and making cocktails Great name and a great bar
Prices for cocktails extremely high Not worth it Cocktail taste was basic nothing special for that price I would have liked something more special The service is really slow From Five working girls only one did the job other four just stood smoked and did nothing
First visit at this bar and It was like love at first sight Couldnt be more appreciative of a bar that had a good set of music beautiful women serving the drinks and assisting you with figuring out the type of beverages youd like to try  Their recipe is their own unique gave their personal recommendations and fixed a drink based on my preferences and of my friend  I never had a properly strong sour alcoholic drink until THAT DAY I visited WHJ Like Top tier creation  Please give those bartending beauties a good tip of when you visit because next time Im already planning to leave a fat tip just for the good experience amazing interaction and help incredible friendliness and good vibes over there  Did I mention I liked their music playlist they use at their bar
One of my favorite bars in the whole wide world Ive been here in 2016 and now today Tiny bar with a big attitude great selection of crazy cocktails great music and atmosphere and a very friendly staff
Great service very good music if your into rockmetal Tasty beer A lot to do and a nice crowd of people They even serve pizza there The only thing the bartenders look a bit depressed Give them a raise and cheer them up 
I visited this place on Halloween they offered a free strong shot for being all spooky and creepy looking since its Halloween The atmosphere design wise is pretty like an underground dungeon or tunnels
It is a nice cosy bar in the cellar of an old building You can play beer pong darts and board games for free Furthermore there is a football table which you have to pay for I havent tried the food so I dont know whether it tastes good or not
Viktor Stefan and Albert are the best hosts You will have the best time here in Vilnius Not abusive prices Really recommended
The atmosphere is very nice and cozy the music is kind loud but thats what u expect going to place like this right  depending on the day of a week it can be either empty or crowded  mostly fridays and weekend its hard to pass through the crowd  drinks r nice but more on a expensive side hence the popularity of the club i guess service is good although u can forget to served fast if its weekend  Overall good experience
The bouncers here are nothing Either they dont  let you in or they cant protect a customer willing to take a chill beer  go to this place if you  dont want any service Choose another option and be grateful to mitigate the dangers of vilnius gatve Anywhere else is more safe then this piece of garbage where service for customers is the last thing any of the employees will care about
La Birra used to be my usual spot to visit but they lost my charm pretty swift Bartenders working like theyve been forced to work there I get it not all jobs are great but It didnt really make me look forward to staying there for long  It felt like any time I tried to buy a drink It was like Ugh leave me alone type of energy from the bartender  Before paying a visit I read about the reviews with the security guards being weirdos and had my own experience  Midway into entering the bar one grabbed my backpack and swiftly let it go thought I had a back strap get hooked into the door handle but  No It was a grown man trying to cartoonishly grab my bag last second and investigate like 2 minutes ago he wasnt just chatting and messing around with another security guard
Perfect place to grab a beer and watch sports in the centre of Vilnius They also have a long menu with different and international dishes and not expensive at all  The staff isvery friendly and it is usually busy during the weekend  You can also enjoy the terrace during good weather days and watch the TV from there too
Apparently 22 eurperson bill isnt enough for the owner so we were forced to order more or leave the pub Also arrogance of the owner was next level The owner gave us a speech about how we dont understand business because we didnt go to business school and that we have to grow up to undestand life in general Im 26 years old for the reference I guess the business school to which the owner went didnt teach about the ethics of communication with your clients I have never been treated in such a way in other places in Vilnius and I have been to numerous places All in all I wont be coming back here
Great cosy place fast service tasty snacks and drinks
I coming there because of amaizingly delicious snacks as snails and shrimps or duck sandwich So far menu is great Hope they will change time from time But these meals i mentioned is worth to try Ribs are not so good
Its not just a good pub for a drink their food is really amazing too On a scale thats much better than pub food so you definitely need to try it Drinks were good too of course and the service was friendly and attentive Id definitely visit again recommend to book in advance as theres not that much seating and it gets busy very quickly
Pour yourself a beer Awesome idea Cheap as well Can go through different beers ciders and other drinks quickly
An interesting bar where you pour your own drink While it is a novel and unique concept there is a lack of bar atmosphere and it feels like fastfood restaurant themed bar
One or the best bars in the hood  the staff is professional nice and the beer selection is marvelous The idea that You can easily try any beer You want and fill your glasses by yourself is making this place likeable and makes You want to come back there again and again Dont forget to try their snacks  prices are reasonable for a quality and taste Visit this bar drink their beers  You wont regret
While the idea is interesting and the beer comes out cheaper than in other places the beer you get is not always of best quality one time the co2 tank was running low sometimes the beer is stale because they probably dont pour a glass of each beer in the morning as they should sometimes if the keg is running low you may get a not so fresh beer Recommendations for best results pick something popular that is above 50 content of the keg so youre sure its not old
I actually dont know how you guys do it Nice personal and nice cheap beer Are you guys money laundrying or part of the mafia or do you just have a massive heart for alcoholics like me Anyways great place and Id recommend it to everyone
Good food and even better prices Very good location and opening times  Beer is less then 2 euro Bottle of vine less then 8 euros Average price of hot dishes around 35 euros Really recommended Will be visiting again soon
Not as busy as other nearby bars of the same chain but good service and tasty cheap food  449 for a main meal I had a pork schnitzel which was great and 180 for 400ml of beer
Decent venue and decent drinks But just a little message to the front of house staff Bartenders and waiterswaitresses Smiling  once JUST ONCE in your lives will NOT kill you I understand that its a cultural thing in the Baltics to always look and act like youre depressed but Ill tell you what smiling at your customers particularly the male ones from female staff members will send them FLOCKING back to your business especially when theyre one of the only people in the bar Trust me 
The best Chicken Kyiv in the town country and a world We already return for it few time Really nice place for a dinner Tasty food reasonable prices good service Also they have really good check out system where you shouldnt wait for a waiter but can just scan QR code and pay
The place is open late The staff is not very friendly We waited for our order for an hour it was one starter and one main dish The food is okay fish and chips are served interestingly with black breading and thing fries Looks nice but oily and too crunchy
Went to book Table but they were a bit aggressive on the mandatory tipping policy and the minimum amount of money we need to spend on each person So we cancelled the reservation But atmosphere looked nice though Need people skill improvement and that might do the trick
Dirigentai is a very nice place for a night out with friends Menu is quite short and simple food comes out quite fast and the quality is fine The beer list is impressive Overall I do not think they deserve a five star rating as they do not aspire to 5 star league But a solid 4 star is justified Aaaaa prices are acceptable and adequate to sevice and quality
Taking classic European flavours to a modern level Meat Lovers is a superbly decorated and warm restaurant with accommodating staff and a delicious menu I would have appreciated more Lithuanian beerswines but that is my only criticism Would highly recommend
Great place and food I would say Looks really fancy but the prices are decent We had pork ribs and duck steak Both were amazing Also homemade lemonade and iced tea are perfect Totally recommend
Nice spot just a bit confusing that for a very small menu 3 items were not available So we ended up not ordering mains and there wasnt much options But appetizers and drinks were great Service on the other hand definitely not the best as servers didnt seem to care at all But overall it was an okay experience
A fantastic meal I had the schnitzel and it was the best Ive ever had The service atmosphere and food was all 5 star worthy They have dine in options and a beautiful outdoor terrace Located in the old town you should add this to your mustdine list I would certainly go back and try more dishes
Good place for dinner with friends Portions are not huge but tasty try some starters first
Group of four 4 went for dinner during non busy hours Food was amazing  had the duck fried cheese platter and apple pie The mixed drink i had from their cocktail menu was not worth it there hot chocolate was okay  The service was quick waiter checked in periodically to for drink refills  The atmopshere was great we were by the fire and the music was nice and relaxing  Overall id recommend eating here and would eat here again Great experience overall
 Green House Restaurant Review   Location  55 Food  25  Recently I visited the Green House Restaurant  and I have mixed feelings about my experience The location is truly fantastic  with a beautiful and serene atmosphere that makes it a perfect spot for a date night  or a relaxing family dinner  With lush green surroundings  it feels like an oasis in the midst of the city   However I was quite disappointed by the food  I had high expectations considering the lovely setting but the dishes served were below average  The presentation was not up to par  and the flavors just didnt come together as they should have I found the menu lacking in variety and the dishes I tried were quite bland and uninspiring   The service though was friendly and attentive  The staff were warm and welcoming which made the experience slightly better But sadly it couldnt make up for the lackluster food quality   In summary the Green House Restaurant  is a great spot for its picturesque location  but the food is a letdown  If youre looking for a scenic venue for a special event  you might consider it but if your priority is a delicious culinary experience  I suggest you explore other options
I had an exceptional dining experience at Old Green Grill House today From the moment I walked in the warm and cozy ambiance set the perfect tone for a delightful meal The service was impeccable with attentive staff who were knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent recommendations  Now lets talk about the food  it was simply outstanding Each dish was bursting with flavor and made with the freshest ingredients The chefs attention to detail was evident in every bite and I couldnt get enough of the delicious flavors  The Old Green Grill House truly stands out as a topnotch restaurant Im already looking forward to my next visit and trying more of their delectable dishes Thank you for a memorable dining experience
Lovely place with charming ambience and positive vibe I truly enjoyed my super yummy pumpkin soup and salmon with majestic view of Cathedral
Amazing location with a view of Cathedral square Deliciuos food I can highly recommend pasta with prawns and burger
The best place in Vilnius  The cocktails are simply amazing Thank you for such a wonderful experience and I am sure I will be coming back soon
Coffee good and strong as it should be Black Forest cookies and Signature dessert Honey Cake are very tasty refined in every detail and nicely served Service very nice and smiling You can drink coffee and try a delicious cake while looking at the Cathedral Square
Great wings Buffalo was really good And the fries are extra crispy
A very nice cool place in the city centre They have a great selection of beers and good apple cider on tap the wings are great We liked the pepper ones and these ones as well as bufalo are also gluten free The guys were understanding and checked for allergens for me so thank you 
Ive dined here several times in Vilnius and the wings never disappoint On this visit we had the pepper and buffalo wings which were both delicious This establishment gets an A for its craft beer on tap and huge quantities of french fries I cant wait to return
Absolutely fantastic Good quality food great beers and friendly staff Would come again
I found myself in Kaunas Lithuania and in need of a beverage We spotted Rebels and dove in  A nice selection of local beers on tap served by a very friendly gentleman bartender We also had a meal and the food was good  Good table service and the ability to sit outside if desired 5 star rating for the dart board availability not ready to find in these parts
Photo  last cocktails served this Thursdays evening Place was closing at 2340 when the info here says working till 1 AM
Fantastic pint  good food and super staff
Good variety of beers including local brews Nice variety on the menu quiet spot Friday afternoon so not as atmospheric as would have liked
Great bar with a good choice of beers and some craft beers Food awesome great pizzas and best chicken wings ive ever had Does show some sky sports games and F1  but not if the local basketball team are playing Food is ordered on app or with waitress and not at the bar Would of been 5 stars but the bloke behind the bar was a miserable git
Very nice place I try to visit it everytime Im in Kaunas Friendly staff good choose of beer from the small local breweries and from worldwide I highly recommend it Last time forgot my hat there so this is a sign that Ill come back there again
An amazing pub in the heart of the city centre next to the fountain Sitting inside or outside are both great options Try as many beers as you can its really worth it The prices are so good a glass is around 34
Best bar in kaunas Professional bartenders that know what they make They know which ingredients to use in a good gin tonic Top notch place and good atmosphere
Officially favourite place in all Kaunas Went with fish and chips and BBQ ribs and can confirm its the only real fish and chips with correct coating and ACTUAL tartar sauce in Lithuania and BBQ ribs cooked to perfection melted off the bone with a delicious sweet crust Also tried brisket with mac and cheese ball and it was delicious  Will be back again and again
I really liked the rustic vibe of the decor the ribs were very soft and tasty Wish there was more meat in the nachos with ribs meat starter
Beer  many types But meat Oh dear  Burger with ribs amazing Ribberis Burger 1110
Fantastic food and great atmosphere in the heart of Kaunas Amazing fresh food and staff were super helpful when helping me pick the right amount of food and which drink complimented it best Lovely outside area and very relaxed atmosphere Cant recommend highly enough 1010
I just happened to be in Kaunas Lithuania and in need of a coldie Dr  Google and a few steps later brought us to Genys Taproom Centrally located in the walking district with a nice selection of beers on two that rotate regularly  Good service and the ability to sit outside if desired
First of all  great place for a beer fans My personal favorite one is Raspberry Milkshake Ale Sixth Month Fried cheese with jalapenos was pretty good addition for a pint of beer
Great team Amazing local beers and really cool toilet Thank you  for your hospitality and support to Ukraine
Excellent local brewed beers I had the Baltic Porter LemonOrange  Pastry sour ale and finally the potent Imperial Tropical sour ale while the wife was shopping Had a nice glow after that 
Nice place to have a beer
Cheap Kaunas beer 05l  25 1l  3eur good tidy environment big TV for sports competitions and series Near bus stop park locking the bike only to the railing 24vt
The saleswoman is drunk she dines with customers When asked if the beer was fresh they refused to serve it Sells takeaway beer on Sundays after 3pm
Good football TV fun atmosphere
The tom aunt at the cash register keeps order Otherwise authentic local fare
Always good company
fine kabak just some kind of clown with zhalgiris mike is spreading around who gave him that mike
Gadyca keep the beer delicious
Food is so saltyservice is nice when i ordered they told me i cant order half of the things i wanted i saw that beer is cheap looks like a place for homeless people
real authentic post Soviet bar experience beer 170 cents real drunks real people just dont be scared or sentiment  go in and drink one or two pints before your train trip
Horrible dirty and stinky As foreigners we just wanted to buy a small snack before taking the train to Vilnius and the bartender was so rude to us When we tried to translate the menu with our phone camera she started yelling at us saying no photo no photo We had to leave
Really authentic bar with great bears nice music and perfect for bigger groups
Nice place with tasty food and a good selection of craft beers The staff is friendly and speaks English  even though there was no English menu available at the moment of our visit everything went smoothly The local specialty altibariai was delicious as well as their lager beercant recall the name
Nice people very good food and an extraordinary atmosphere
Cozy place nice customer service bartender really knows her drinks Good place to spend evening with friends
Really friendly good beer and food
Real chill place accidentally went in when it was a basketball game so the company is mainly men but that didnt bother to get drinks and have fun Prices are decent the view is absolutely amazing especially during sunrise Staff is nice and simple you can pay with credit card from 5 and up So baasically if you want to hang out with some friends  thats definitely a place to go Will make sure to comeback on Karaoke Tuesday
Good beer but thats it Do not order food here please for your own health the food is terrible here tried 3 dishes fried bread with cheese beef burger and chilli soup all of them terrible and i never complain about food Dear managers please fire whole kitchen and start all over again And the cherry on top one of bartenders spitted in to the trash bin while I was ordering food
Definitely worth it for the view of the boardwalk A cool place for a drink
Its a nice bar to chill out sometimes the bar its slow and the atmosphere depend in the day you choose to go
Food is very delicious Everything is handmade Appetizers are super Strongly recomend spicy beef and hangover burgers Also very nice tuna dishes 
Delicious burger and the beef cheeks were good too Keep in mind you cant order from the table and the service is a tad slow but the food is worth the wait Located on a quiet street its a nice place to visit
Im very happy that I visited this place Quite good variety of beers  ciders and fantastic food especially burgers
We had degustation of 4 beers and it was worth it Amazing value for the price only 64 So many great beers to choose from Very friendly staff
Its normal



This is the place for a cocktail in Kaunas excellent bartenders with great knowledges of drinks and alcohols nice and cozy location good music and overall good vibes
To put it simply  a hidden gem in Kaunas Theater made into a bar I liked the atmosphere and drinks
Great bar very nice surprise The cocktails are expensice but delicious
Cute hipster bar with a chilled vibe Cocktails are really good
Good


If you dont know how to work with food dont work with food  The burger is nothing like what is pictured No sauce the bacon is cold and not yet cooked the meat is dry Had to throw it away
I ate vegetarian pita burger and it was super amazing Not too much pita amazing taste and the staff is really nice too By the way the interior is also good Recommend  PS Next time I had veggie burger and its ever more awesome
Lovely service  nice vibe and music  Lunch veggie burger was okay but nothing special The starter soup looked good though  I didnt want that and they minused 1 euro from the bill which I wasnt excepting Would try again something else
My recent experience with Sventas Dumas was extremely disappointing I placed an order for tacos with chips and BBQ pork ribs with chips and coleslaw through the app Although the delivery was prompt the quality of the food left much to be desired  To my dismay the first taco I unwrapped contained a hair which immediately killed my appetite Unable to proceed with the taco I decided to give the BBQ pork ribs a chance Unfortunately they were disappointingly cold and lacked any distinct flavor Even after a few initial bites the overall taste failed to impress The coleslaw that accompanied the meal was drenched in excessive mayonnaise resulting in a watery consistency that further contributed to the unsatisfactory experience  Regrettably I had no choice but to discard the entire meal after trying the coleslaw The lackluster quality of the ingredients used in these specific dishes raises serious concerns I cannot in good conscience recommend ordering from Sventas Dumas based on this experience alone The value for money was poor considering the subpar taste and the unfortunate presence of a hair in one of the tacos  Upon reaching out to their customer support I was offered a mere 20 percent refund which I found inadequate given the overall disappointment and the need to discard the entire meal A full refund would have been a more appropriate resolution considering the circumstances  Considering the underwhelming food quality including cold and flavorless BBQ pork ribs the coleslaw drowning in excessive mayo the unfortunate presence of a hair in the taco and the necessity to discard the entire order I am compelled to caution others against ordering from Sventas Dumas  In light of this highly unsatisfactory experience I have no intention of patronizing this establishment in the future
A Kaunas Gem for Beer Lovers  This craft beer spot in Kaunas Old Town is a mustvisit Great beers delicious food and friendly service Highly recommended 
The only downside of this pub is that it only opens at 5pm and I cant daydrink there 12 craft beers on tap from IPAs to sour ales Zirga Galva IPA and Milkshake Ale were definitely my favourites Definitely best craft beers in town maybe in the whole country
Best place for craft beer in Kaunas Friendly staff great selection of best lithuanian craft drinks cosy atmosphere 1010
Cozy place fantastic beer an the bar tender was very kind and welcoming
Nice beers for fair price had some dinner which was good the portion wasnt big but fair for the price

Another newly reborn place in Kaunas There was such a successful bar in Kaunas in the interwar period Pal Al this is a hint to that only in almost a century a number of positive changes have taken place Orders are taken at the bar The chicken schnitzel was a real feast big juicy perfectly cooked next to fries pickled vegetables with mashed cabbage The menu is small and not boring they say that they took inspiration from interwar recipes they are not afraid to experiment and interpret they will try to show that Lithuanian gastroculture can be interesting On weekends you will be invited with a late breakfast As the name suggests a wide selection of sparkling drinks Well in addition to the same the prices dont bite Credited
A gloomy Sunday afternoon was brightened by the bartender and chef of this place  The food is amazing the atmosphere is very good 
Came at the pub asked if you close soon they acted annoyed then I asked again and then she said we work until 3am then we ordered because until the close time was 15hThe bodyguard came gave us some threats for no reason Very bad service would never go again Scary to visit
Good selection of lithuanian craft beer friendly barmaid
Great spot in Klaipda to grab pint of Guiness listening to bartender talking zemaitiskai 
the barmen was very rude second time I come here no manners she looked angry and behaved inpolite food was ok prices dont bite but could be more friendly not recommended
Excellent music and great service Delicious snacks and large selection of beers Was absolutely packed on a Friday night Id like to come back here next time in Klaipeda
My husband and I arrived late for one quick drink and ended up staying for hours  There is a very well stocked bar however we stuck to beer and cider  The atmosphere is lively accompanied by awesome tunes  We met friendly locals and generally had a brilliant time
Great music fast and friendly service Food options are great just wasnt to my taste
Why I asked myself  A bar in Klaipeda named after a 1970s Irish rock star Apparently the owner likes him so why not We went in a couple of times whilst in Klaipeda All was good A wide range of drinks with a pub food menu I tried a variety of beers from 4 euros to 55 for 5lt My partner had a large wine 200 ml and the total came to 12 euros We were not hungry so we just ordered a side of french fries These were tasty and came with a selection of sauces  Menu in Lithuanian and English  Finally I saw Rory Gallagher play in the late 1970s at Lancaster University He was pretty good
The nicest service in the city Perfect place to chill out and eat good food
One of the best burgers in town
This one of best cozy restaurant in Klaipeda Such a nice environment nice hospitality delicious dishes beautiful presentation a big wine list and wonderful desserts I recommend to everyone I would like to come back here again and again
Made a reservation Sat down early for some drinks and snacks Ordered the Club 26 platter Everything was good except the fried anchovies they were way too salty  Reservation time came and party of 4 tried to order steak We were told by the waiter they didnt have anymore steak  Dont recommend this place if visiting unless you are the first served of the day for a better chance of having steak
Great place with 90s rock and some board games The service is very good and there are several types of beer to pick from
Perhaps not everyone would feel at home in this pub due to its casual atmosphere but its a fascinating and distinctive spot in Klaipeda where you might encounter intriguing individuals Its certainly worth checking out
Best rock pub very drunk very cozy feels home Much wow
Realy fun place to meet with your friends 
The bar is exclusive  Older style but very cozy Staff Pleasant helpful Music Good
The bartender was looking for tires there he asked all the customers so I have an offer maybe you still need it
One of the most beloved bars Karaoke music songs dances very fun atmosphere Good luck to them keep it up
Now we dont visit anymore something has changed and not for the better The service staff is very unpleasant
Delicious kibinis kindly received with a puppy
Thats not the place in the photo its a disgusting place dont go there
living place
Good place
On Friday night awful kids music playlistBetter try Thursday Catastrophic Macarena after ACDC Staff has obviously neither taste nor GRACE Purely cruel engagement of moodkillers Leaving now
They use some sketchy stuff to increase their ratings on google reviews and to make em look way better than it is For some reason I wasnt able to post a 1 star review on this terrible place for a long time Worst experience ever 1 out of 5 Do not recommend btw i rarely write bad reviews but this damn barn will always hold a special place in my heart lmao The worst of thw worst
Cannot comment on food since I didnt order any but drinks are good bartenders are friendly and the vibe is on point with a good time
Nice interior Very quiet when off peak plenty of seats overall good vibes
My favorite wittering hole 
9000 style bar with cheap beer
Best bar in the town
Best hole in the planet 
I like here Wonderful sound system and everything make you happy
Coctails from a list are made nice and professional Music bit too loud and lights aggressive but all along around the neighbourhood fine place to go on Sunday 
The bartenders are really nicee and funny 
Suprer coctails nice music bravo
Cozy place to enjoy your evening Friendly staff perfect hookah and tasty cocktails
Best  cotails in town super nice stuff  great hooka Realy recomend to visit with a friend or fore date night

Cozy and nice place
Good pub
Nice
Jack lemonade
It was not possible to order any of the desired dishes I had to eat the offered dish but the food was really tasty At noon there were not too many people we had to wait about 3040 minutes
The only and only place in iauliai where you can hear decent music and just chill
Space bar is nice place to have a good time
On the weekends it is the place to be if you like electronic music
Nice place to have some fun 
Good club Good girls best coctails
Great Place Flexible Amazing drinks and atmosphere 5 star team and services
Best place in town high class service and hookahs large variety of drinks to choose from
Great unexpected party
Enjoyed my time here Staff were pleasant  Had a pool table punching machine and chess board for entertainment  Nice area to sit outside  Toilets were a bit grubby though and not for the faint of heart  Made a decent aperol spritz
We came here to play Snooker There was no bartender so we waited 10 min Then the man sitting on the bar asked us if we wanted something We said yes so the same men was the bartender But we have waited 10 mins already right next to him We played Snooker after two rounds we had to leave so the opening hours need be actualised  The Guinness beer was old and warn off  Unfortunately cant recommend it
Around 3 oclock in the morning we were on our way to the AirBnB when we fruitlessly searched for a bar with freshly tapped beer and some atmosphere Along the way we passed by a pub named Victory The name seemed promising so we decided to go in At the door we were approached by a friendly older man who bore a resemblance to the German politician Friedrich Merz He explained that we should talk to him as there was an exciting show happening in the basement  a bachelor show Being young and curious we ventured into the secret basement We were well aware that it was probably a scam yet the ladies were very nice Thanks to you Friedrich who acted like Pablo Escobar for this unforgettable evening
Cool place for chess As advertised online they meet every Tuesday night at 630pm for chess but Im here at almost 730pm and no one is here for the blitz tournament
Good bar  restaurant Tasty and wide food selection Service very good and attentive Reasonable price Located in Old Riga
A great pub  restaurant serving a wide range of ales The food was reasonably priced tasty and in huge quantities Staff were excellent friendly and efficient and knowledgeable of their beers
We ate Fish and Chips and it was simply delicious Thank you It was busy hour so we waited ab 40 minutes but meanwhile they have food beers
One of the nicer places in the old town Great service pub dishes on restaurant levevel Well worth a visit Oh and the beer advice was spot on
Pros Great beer selection delicious food WiFi friendly staff Cons found a few tiny bones in the fish and chips which is uncommon I didnt mind the gherkins instead of peas
Wonderful bar The bartenders are very nice and have great service especially Rebeka She makes everyone feel welcome and ensures that that everyone is having fun
Good service a lot of beers on tap
Very good beer The service here is very nice Pleasant environment and good prices I can recommend
The atmosphere in this restaurant is super cozy Decorated with great taste loved the colors Service was very friendly and the recommendations the staff made were on point Food was delicious and so were the drinks Would def visit again
The first negroni bar in the Baltic states Very cozy atmosphere and an astonishingly large cocktail menu Saw some people eating delicious looking shrimp too I had the pepper infused negroni Perfection I wish I could try them all but then someone would have to carry me home The menu is so witty and diverse If I lived here I would come for a drink every day You gotta try this place which doesnt need a name
Vwry chilled and cozy atmosphere Portion of meals were big on breakfast and it was delicious Some combinations may seem unusual but the are very good It is pitty that the place is very small and dont have much seats And just have on mine that prices are higher
Tiny place but great vibe and tasty breakfasts We had the sourdough  very filling lots of avocado I loved the spicy hummus  and Canada pancakes  super fluffy and tasty The lattes were great as well Very nice staff
Enjoying a pint after a beautiful walk from our office to the old town of Riga What a view at Kiwi bar The same positive atmosphere and lovely staff Love this place Elina is a best bartender
Full of middle aged guys like me watching sport during the day Young ones came for a beer then left Maybe various channels showing different sports rather than all the 10 tvs showing the same golf game Small bar with a deck Looked like a fun bar but that was probably during the evening
Great bar sister bar to Funny Fox Great service by a single person who seems to run the whole place She has blonde hair and glasses but didnt catch her name but very attentive and polite service Will definitely return
Whilst on our trip to Riga city we had to stop by Kiwi Bar being kiwis ourselves it was a must little did we know that we would always end up here late and or to closing fueled by the a couple of amazing barmaids Elly  Valerija which always kept the atmosphere alive and thriving and full of laughs  The layout and entertainment was perfect and there was never a dull moment whilst the nights we were there Myself and other 2 friends made sure we purchased a shirt before we left as some memorabilia to take with us back home  Only dislike was lack of NZ money pinned up behind the bar p  Overall would love to go back again in future so it might be on the cards soon 
So I was very kindly asked if I would like to make a Google review for this bar I believe this is the second google review I have ever made in my life and I am absolutely honored to be doing it for the Funny Fox I have lived and worked in many countries in my life and this is by far one of the best bars I have ever been to The people that work there are incredibly kind and really have made an atmosphere unparalleled to any other Great drinks great people and great karaoke I was only in Latvia for a few days but every night I knew exactly where to go I am incredibly grateful to all the staff of the Funny Fox and know that this is a place if you are a lone traveler you will leave this establishment with more friends than you came into Riga with In fact I met someone from a different country my last night there who said they had a friend that passed away Before that friend died they recommended the Funny Fox as the top place to go in Riga We got to honor his friends memory and I know there is no better place in the world to do so than here A very very big paldies to all of the workers there and I am looking forward to the next time I am in Riga just to hang out at the number 1 bar in all of Europe If youre a local its perfect If youre just traveling through they will make you feel like a local If you are ever here in this city I ask you to do a favor and enjoy this most  amazing and beautiful place in the heart of Riga
Exceptional staff at Funny fox in Riga The warm welcome and assistance with song selection made our karaoke night unforgettable The bartenders crafted delicious drinks with topnotch service and genuine smiles The atmosphere was vibrant and fun Thanks to the wonderful staff especially Kristina Yana Emily and Valerie for making our visit exceptional This place is a mustvisit for a fun night out Kudos to the amazing team Highly recommended
These girls put the funny in fox Kristine especially Best bar service Iv ever had and the best alcoholic beverage Iv ever had Great place to bring your kids and bro down
Rugby World Cup plays here  karaoke  I asked what types of beer were 2 listed Bartender Want to try Me Ok Bartender brings 2 large beers 
Great cozy pub with delicious beer The place is ran by the nicest lady
Initially enjoyed the beer and shots called in to watch the Liverpool game But for reasons we are still unclear of were asked to leave before the end of the match  Little disappointed
Great traditional Estonian boozer Most of the clientele are local For a quite unfussed drink couldnt be beaten
Glorious institution the highest to be found in all of Riga can imagine it to be the setting of a Tom Waits or Nick Cave lyrical concept with Mark E Smith grovelling in the corner
This is a pearl in downtown Riga Good food good beer a lot of choice and very nice people Pavel is very service minded but really all of them are I can certainly recommend this place for a lunch or dinner
This place is amazing  Huge selection of beers and the food is great  If you gonhere you must try the unfiltered lager  That was the best beer Ive had in years  just perfect  We also had the Black burgers with venison and lingonberry  Cooked to perfection  moist tasty and served with crispy salty chips  Heaven
Hidden in a alley but once you find this place you discover an very nice terrace They have a wide choice of beer and food Enjoyed it very much on the terrace would definitely recommend
One of my favourite places for beer and dinner in Riga Easygoing atmosphere and very friendly staff as well as pretty good food the ribs are superb make me want to come back time and time again My only gripe is with the rotating House beer recipe Ive had one absolutely excellent beer there but it seems like I wont ever have it again since they change what the house beer is regularly
Nice place to play pool Beer is quite affordable I would say average price around city centre and pool tables well maintained Can recommend to anyone who plays pool darts or slot machine
21st of August 1700 Loved this place but the new bartender guy was very unpleasant Made us free drinks which we didnt even ask for When i aproached him i asked for beer he said full price I asked isnt it 150 if i play slots I got answer  but you are not there at slot machine told him i have money already in im playing He said  but you are not sitting there Previous bartenders were nice and communicating but i sadly cant say this about this guy
Plenty of sitting areas and the bar offers both pool and darts Overall a great place I can recommend larger groups struggling to find a place to drink
Place is ok but only for one drink




Nice place and delicious coffee


Deserves ZERO STAR I went here with a group of 4 the waitress couldnt be bothered to say Hi  didnt reply when greeted She slammed menus on the table in front of us instead of giving it to us individually  walked away  The service we got pretty much went downhill from then on Each time you tried to talk to her she just walks away Even when you had questions about the food and drinks The beef burger looked as if the chef threw his belt between 2 stale breads  When a guest pays 104 without touching his food that should ring alarm bells in the staffs brain to make them ask the guest if everything was ok Not in this place We were made so uncomfortable that we were happy to walk out into the heavy rain  This place can learn alot from their next door neighbour which is by far the best restaurant  bar in this lovely city
Mirinda Esperanto word Meaning Wonderful Amazing  Mir Wonder IndaWorthy  Mir  Inda  Worth of wonder  Causes wonder
Proper cocktails  cheap beer and tasty food  Good place for a Friday night out   Signature cocktails are highly recommended Also very friendly staff

Great place for chillaxing inventive and well executed artisan cocktails
Very atmospheric place Delicious cocktails They brought free water some snacks and even compliments I liked it very much I recommend it to everyone for a great time 
Very super place We spent a wonderful weekend evening here Reserve tables in advance
Pleasant atmosphere highquality service you will not try such drinks anywhere in Daugavpils For bloody marys on beer separate 5 stars
The guest house of the meat sorter David Hoyers widow Margarethe Gertrude Hoyer or the 17th  19th century interior museum is a success story of how an important architectural landmark of national importance an element of Liepjas cultural heritage is witnessing its renaissance and is now open to the public in the open museum format  The building has long been known to the residents and visitors of the city through the historical fact that according to testimonies Russian Tsar Peter the Great visited Liepja and Madame Hoyers Guest House in 1697 during his Grand Embassy trip  Today the 17th  19th century museum provides a glimpse into the unique late 17th century quarters which have been restored on the ground floor of the interior museum or so called Madame Hoyers Guest House highlighting and accentuating the values of the late 17th century and the first half of the 18th century preserved through the centuries and several reconstructions Not only has the original ground floor layout been restored  the tavern and Madame Hoyers living rooms but also the historic mantelpiece with the bread oven allowing the visitor to experience the atmosphere of the period  On the second floor of the interior museum the visitors climb up into the former attic and find themselves in a former storeroom where they can continue their experience of the tavern and enter the rooms built in the second half of the 19th century The second floor of the museum is associated with the 19th century architecture of the building and houses the apartment of notary Christoph Wilhelm Stender and his family It is known that the house and the tavern have been the property of notary Christoph Wilhelm Stender since 1835 The restored apartment with its historic wallpapering and room plan including Mr Stenders living room nursery bedroom and kitchen reflects the idea of a 19th century home of a wealthy Liepja resident  The interior museum or Madame Hoyers Guest House is the outcome of several years of dedicated restoration and close cooperation between Liepja Municipality Liepja Museum and architect Liesma Markova resulting in an interior museum with a tangible 17th19th century feel historical atmosphere and an offer for visitors to travel back centuries in the past  Very authentic restaurant  first floor and amazing Cafe Stenders cakes to die all home made  second floor
Nice place to stay for the rest Authentic and well presented 17th century lifestyle
Probably the best place for great meal in Liepaja Suggest Crayfish are perfect
Interesting historical place with delicious food
Great cocktails  the bartender is skilled  On the weekends the music and crowd is cool  Everyone is friendly  Can only recommend
Definitely best cocktail place in town Not cheap but they make best cocktails in town 1010
Perfect place in Liepaja city Good serviss Very tasty cocktails
Best bar in Liepaja and the staff is amazing  Big thanks to the bartenders for amaizing weekend 
We were very hungry The burger is very basic no extras The small one is really small Bun quality is low Salad without dressing French fries too much salt The beer is very good
I orderd BBQ almost at midnight on Wednesday I heard how they grill my steak Very good with baked potatos and fresh salad Also very positive chef and grwat rock music
Paid 850 euro for fries Food is not tasty looks bad and expencive
The kebab plate DOES NOT HAVE FRENCH FRIES why how is this possible never have i seen this and i eat kebab plate every week also falafel plate gives you 2 small falafel pieces these portions are a bit ridiculous the outside terrace is very nice though
Overall good place and good service This cost me 1050EUR which is good price for two pork chops and the fries with cheese sauce The cheese sauce was my favorite
Ribs was amazing Price is 7 for them it is almost for free because it was really big piece of meat Had to wait around 1h but it was 100 worth it Definitely would suggest to come
Very good if there is an event but otherwise not the best
Nice place nice beer and foodI definitely here again be for i go back home to Ireland
Good beer decent place to stop for a quick drink
The place with unique atmosphere of late soviet period Wide range of draft beer local and imported
Heaven for any beerlover wonderful selection of craft beer at very low prices Unforgettable
Cool place
When we arrived from a neighboring country we were served very badly We couldnt buy drinks even with driving licences they required passports We were even asked to leave the terrace even though our friends were sitting with the drinks they had bought We are very disappointed we will not return and we will not recommend to others Also half an hour after the drinks the friends became sick poor quality drinks
A 247 bar attached to a casino You can get some decent beer for a relatively good price and other drinks dont break the bank either But dont come here for a romantic dinner  They heat pizza slices in a plastic bag and proudly slide the slice on to your plate with the water and fat from the plastic bag dripping Also lasagna or whatever it was is taken from the freezer on demand put in to an oven for 5 minutes and served Luckily I didnt have to eat these delicacies but the people I saw that did didnt finish their portions  We were standing in front of the bar counter for 10 minutes before the workers paid any attention to us  each had to wait the 10 minutes one by one with a few others making their orders successfully in the middle  Bad service
Mediocre bar in a great city Usually the only place that is open for drinking after 23pm The people can be somewhat interesting there
Exquisite delicious cuisine calm atmosphere and good prices Commend
Waited for 1 hour for only 4 pizzas we were 6 people and the only ones that this cafe The waitress mixed our order had we had to wait for another 2025 minutes
Sur the worste pub i was in Latvia The waitress is not kind at all she makes no effort to communicate The burgers we ordered are served without any supports as fries salad or others Furthermore the meet was not cook and the products seem all to be frozen food I strongly advice against this place
Amazing food for the price Really good customer service with really fluent english Understanding about allergies  allergens glutenfree options Highly recommended
Fast service with good friendly  feeling
Best Chebureki I ever eat Highend taste very juicy lamb meat soft and thin dough Advice keep it eat horizontally on the paper tray so that all the juice spreads in the middle and you can taste it It is so delicious 55
The best chebureki ever
You can be happy if they dont punch or rob you
Cheburek tasted OK Place is run down and does look a little out of date
While the ambience and service was generally quite good I was disappointed with the food The temperature of the meat soup was luke warm and it had enough dill to garnish the entire pot that it came from The soy sauce caramel steak was served cold with far too much basil and fruit for my liking  There is obviously better food on the menu but I can only judge the mutual mistakes that were made on this occasion  Oh and watch out for the obscene number of wasps
Nice outside seating that is directly facing the sun during the afternoon Prices are around 10 for the pot dishes and appetizers Would recommend the garlic rye bread and the grey peas with bacon The smoked hearing is good but an acquired taste Service could be a bit more proactive but they were extremely nice
We were in the end offered an apology for the delay but in my opinion quite disappointing Food was okay but the service was not acceptable We received our drinks after almost 30min Food after 1hr We saw other tables getting served before us It is conveniently located ne t to a street leading to the beach but I would not go back Definitely not when it is full Bathroom was also in terrible condition
A very nice cafe We had lunch here The salmon was cooked perfectly and the price was reasonable Quality food and good service Would definitely recommend this place for a good lunch with seating on the roadside
I liked pork ribs it was very soft almost like marshmello Uavas kvass was good   view was excellent  there was old wind mill and under wind mill blades was our table 
We were very satisfied with the food Tasty good size portions Can really recommend garlic bread toasts  There were some small issues with small part of our order but waiters really did their best to solve it as quick as possible  While food was really good i cant say the same about drinks  somehow cocktails we ordered were a little tasteless
want to start by saying that the place is not far from the city the territory is large there is a playground houses for living and most importantly very very good restaurantBest service thanks to the waitress who served usReally enjoyedvery tasty food we recommend to visit this place
Nice place where to stay at night and at least for four people in the house Have delicious kitchen the houses are clean and beautiful have their own kitchen showers Parking available The city is very close if you need something additionaly
We rarely go to the gaming hall to relax For 5 euros to gamble I like Dzoker I am a customer Kind team They offer coffee and a blueberry cocktail for free the girl on the bank even offered pizza Kind pleasant team
Its a game room not a cafeteria



Please do not visit you will be left without shoes
Normal
Good coffee





One of the few places where you can relax in our city Comfort good service best DJs stylish music NOT A DISHMAN ESTABLISHMENT IN WHICH YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD RECREATION TIME
The quiz quiz at the bar is worth a visit
Very small room
 
No longer exists Its now the Vendum gastropub which has great food and atmosphere
If you want to watch a game of football while drinking Guiness beer then this is the right place for you 







Absolutely love this bar Extremely friendly welcoming well run bar Decent food offering plenty of tvs so you watch your favourite sport and pleasant outdoor seating area
One of the few pubs I could find in the city where people were being very sociable including the staff I had a great night with new friends
It is a wonderful place with such an amazing vibe Everything from the food drinks and especially the staff exceeded all expectations The staff are so friendly and the owner Iain is awesome I could listen to him talk for hours he knows a lot about a lot I cant say enough about the hospitality from everyone there I was in Kosovo for four weeks and found myself stopping by there at least once a daynight for about three weeks I dont drink so thats got to say something about this place I would definitely recommend going on trivia night ordering the chicken fingers bacon cheese burger watching a football game and chatting with Iain Iain and Desh I am glad to have met you and look forward to seeing you all again someday
Best place in Pristina by far Friendly service great food and amazing quiz nights Board games karaoke football games beer rakia and food literally all you need for a great night out

The best place to eat breakfast in Prishtina 12 for two people and it was yummy I highly recommend this place We also came in the evening for live music and it was a nice atmosphere over here
Favorite spot in Pristina  highly recommended Very friendly staff awesome atmosphere and tasty food
Great decor and good menu Below average Coffee Latte Very loud music at 9 am Difficult to have a conversation Still 4 stars as I hope it will improve to take out these kinks and be a wonderful place Happy they didnt destroy this building
Food is delicious and tasty And coffee is good 


The only queer pub in Kosova Be sure to check it out whenever youre in town if you wanna have a dance and enjoy bubbly cocktails The owners are extra welcoming and friendly Also the terrace is pretty chill during the day too 
Fantastic cocktails friendly staff and always a great environment with fun people And a great space for queer folk to hang out  The first and so far only queer bar in the city
Its the place that I feel most safe Its my second home Its the place that I feel no one will steal my bag if I leave it randomly on a chair Come here you wont regret it 
Bar LGBTQR regular Queer show Nice place to enjoy a coffee on a quiet terrasse or having cocktails and beer for long party night
Amazing always
Good service nice place
Top experiencw
Cool
They have a nice cocktail menu Highly recommended 
Good place for coffee and drinking Not sure for food The disadvantage of this place is that it smells cigarette They allow smoking inside the place I wouldnt recommend if you are not smoker
Wonderful place Great vibe Good food Terrific service
The  service is sooooooo bad I asked for ice for my drink  i got it after 10 minute the same happened when I asked for  the other things  I ordered fajitas it was cold  and not fresh  Never come again 
The service wasnt clientoriented In fact the waitress took the order with the following statement  Pardon and was a bit cold The offer of white wines isnt that big  just Alexandria  The ambiance is nice and it is although a cool place to hang out with your friends Be patient and enjoy your time
The perfect dive bar in the city Its small and cozy and always full of people
I know this place since 2016 and still enjoy the quiet atmosphere of this pub between daily life and having a rest by cafe beer or drinks in sparkling Pristina city centre
Friendly excellent coffee
Very friendly staff and good food
One of the greatest place not only to eat but to hand out in Pristina  Was visiting city on my trip around Kosova and my friend recommended it  Food is good drinks tasty people friendly but also design of it is quite unique and cozy at the same time
Its a very cozy and not expensive place I loved the view service and the food was amazing Looking forward to going back 
Just had coffee A very pleasant atmosphere
Very nice restaurant unfortunately we had to wait too long to get our food



The bar is full of cigarette smoke If you dont smoke avoid it

Nice pub
Good pub with a great selection of rioja Generous fruit machines If you like Celtic a great pub as they show all the live games If youre not a Celtic fan then thats fine as apart from when Celtic games are on any football fans are welcome If a Celtic game is on then it fills up and best go elsewhere at these times New landlady has made a lot of effort with the pub Wifi is available too and excellent background music non of this lazy music TV shite
Typical local pub cheap beers and lively placewith friendly staff
Home from home experience for me Great management  good staff great clientele 
Johny doc and his staff are very hospitable welcoming and efficient
Just a great little beer pub Great welcome
Excellent traditional pub No TVs playing football or karaoke A good range of real ales too Also a good range of whiskies and gin This pub doesnt serve food though
Lovely pub very welcoming
Unassuming local pub with amazing whisky selection Cash only
Im at a nearby hotel and the noise coming from this establishment is horrendous There is a group of customers outside singing and shouting from the top of their lungs without due regard for others No one wants to be a killjoy but this is also our holiday The management needs to show some level of respect for others
Called in on a Friday at 6pm for a few beers Very liverly and busy Only small criticism is when its packed why turn music on loud so people have to shout to be heard Result very noisy and you can hardly hear your selve speak Other wise a nice bar
Great atmosphere in the Princes Bar which is enthusiastically run by Sarah Burns Sarah raises amazing amounts for many charities including the Jersey Heart Support Group charity who are eternally grateful to her
Great pub Staff were brilliant Busy but plenty of room Good evening had by all Thanks
Quite possibly the best pub I have ever been to The land lady is absolutely outstanding with her charisma charm and positive attitude it completely bypasses how okay her partner is Admittedly he does manage to get the games you want on the TV unless youre a West Brom supporter all in all if you are looking for an actual pub then this is a great place to go to
Had a fab biker Rock night at The Old English  and raised money for the most amazing generous crew of our JLB houres of volentory work dond too much to value in money terms you are all amazing Steve Flipper and Lyn are here to help any time if we can xxxxx
Great pub for sport and a lovely friendly bar tender
So friendly   has made our holiday Kelly thank you and truly hope to see you again next year Chris and Polly
Great little bar with daytime comfort reasonable menu
Good location right in the shopping area of At Helier Its possible to sit outside and the outside seating has an awning so no problem if its raining
Friendly staff Nice burgers
Too boring for adults they dont even suggesst how to take pics and everything else But a very nice place for kids
Its a pub like many others it has no stand out attributes the fish and chips were fine The beer a bit more than I would usually pay per pint but kept well and a good temperature The best you can say is that it was convenient
We ordered food a simple fish and chips 40 mins later no food had arrived although 3 other tables who had ordered after us had received their food One table had nearly finished theirs I will not return We went to Hugos and ordered the same items and was with us with in a short time Lovely friendly efficient service at Hugos Well worth a try
Traditional pub great local beer with a sunny outside space overlooking a quiet tree lined square perfect for afternoon drinks
A nice place to sit and have a drink although they were serving quite a few meals Sit inside or out Pleasant bar staffand have local beer
This is an absolutely Brilliant place to go Drinks are very reasonably priced and the staff are so friendly  Fridays and Sundays they have a karaoke   and its a fantastic atmosphere 
Great drinking pub at real prices not like most of the other tourist traps Fantastic service and atmosphere thank you a credit to the Jersey industry
Very welcoming and caring staff and regular customers  Thank you very much Paul  
A pleasant place to have a couple of pints on a lovely day
A nice local pub with many nooks and crannies to sit in Disappointed they didnt have the local beer As I am quite enjoying it Good service from the friendly staff
They charged 390 for a gin which was ok but then 390 for the tonic which is ludicrously expensive When I questioned why so expensive the man said that is what we have to charge We will not be going back
Dont let the old looking exterior fool you walk on in This is a friendly pub with lovely staff who are welcoming to all Whether you are a local or visitor this is a great pub Its just an ordinary pub without whistles and bells The staff are friendly and helpful The prices are reasonable and the food is hearty with good portions Its always a varied but welcoming place peppered with those who use it as a local and visitors from Jersey and afar Good WiFi as well  My reviews 3 meets expectations normal good score 4 exceeds 5 outstanding rare
Didnt eat there just had drinks service was quick drinks cold good choice of drinks prices reasonable for jersey
the ambience is good but the food was not what i had expected  the special menu pan fried trout was not what i had expected the broth of crab bisque that came with it just tasted like sea water i expected seafood sweetness in it the trout was not well seasoned the potato was okay  We ordered the oyster to try probably we are not a fan but it was fresh i was expecting wasabi but the sauce is just soy sauce with honey  as for the rib eye steak it was pretty bad it was dry we ordered medium rare but most of the part was medium to medium well  the sides were okay shout out to the oyster mushrooms i was pretty well cooked  I ordered the wrong dessert the rice pudding was very filling It doesnt taste like dessert more like a proper nice meal  for service wise it doesnt feel welcome probably the waitresses were having a bad day
Great spot to sit with a drink on a sunny day on the pavement watching the world go by The staff are friendly and welcoming and theres a great range of drinks available at good prices Tables are all clean and theres a nice atmosphere Id recommend
Went for a meal last night with my girlfriend for valentines day the meal was lovely and the staff were so friendly The staff even came around with a polaroid camera to take pictures of couples that they could take home with them with a heart frame such a nice little touch
Topped off an excellent short break by having excellent food listening to fab singerguitarist really friendly atmosphere So much so we went back for lunch the next day 
This was a second visit to here had a different choice off their new menu which is completely new and simple Again great food with excellent service thoroughly recommend if staying in jersey Thank you Martin from Damon and Michelle
It was busy but they fitted us in for dinner I ordered a childs menu as i only wanted a small meal was good food and plenty of it My husband had a adults meal and there was loads
Delicious food friendly service and dogs welcome a lovely pub perfect for lunch after our walk Best of success to the new management for your new venture
Typical local pub not a bad place to go for a quick drink however not my type of place to visit Prices were decent the decor quite interesting however I wouldnt come back and it was missing a fun atmosphere
Traditional pub and very enjoyable jovial atmosphere Good selection of beers and ideal for sports lovers no matter where you are sat you will be able to a TV screen showing live evemts
Always have to pop in here for a few drink great atmosphere
No food in this bar just really good beer at reasonable prices Served by very helpful staff
Great place great vibe great karaoke music 5 star
Great night with EXCELLENT food chocolate and caramel tart for dessert
Great place Food was excellent and very competitively priced Highly recommended
Bouncers wouldnt let me and my friends in even though we are 19 and had valid UK license ID Flew from England and wanted a night out and wasnt even allowed in They said they cant accept UK license due to forgery incidents But the people behind us was also from UK and let them in Absolute joke bouncers was so horrible we were so friendly and explained we are over 18
Lovely food Very reasonable Nice atmosphere excellent all round Staff very attentive
When visiting my brother in Jersey all ways call in to the Britt for a few pints never had any bother with the Manager and staff would highly recommend calling in for a Drink
Love this place its a local away from the local youre left alone to enjoy your poison and the game
Good friendly pubone of a few remaining pubs in Jersey
Best pub in town  X
Surprisingly nice pub considering its in the city of st brelade  Its way bigger than it looks with 2 bars the back beer garden and the front patio bit  Live music in the back bar footy in the front sun outside  Something for everyone  I went to the sausage fest also which was most surprisingly not an absolute sausage fest
Plenty of space they have two gardens outside with tables for customers in front and the rear of pub Atmospfere is vintage with old furniture Prices of drinks are average for Jersey but avoid coffe beucause its not good
Great place for a pint and to watch the football also a good outside area
Great Pub for live music and sport Reasonable prices Good beers Bar snacks only No food service
Best pub in Jersey  Frank and Carole was very friendly pub owners and they treated us like their friends They were very welcoming I will definitely come back to this pub Thanks for kindness and hospitality Ezgi your friend from London
Very nice pub
Great one bar locals pub popular with some Jersey Bulls fans on matchdays
Nice place but closes too early Old style pub Very friendly people in there Good memories
Banging place for a few libations in the afternoon sun
Hilarious story we were kicked out for stinking of Tar The bartender could not deal with it He came begging us to move outside or not come tomorrow Love it laughed our assess off
Entered Ignored by person behind bar Drinks expensive Very loud Wont be back 
Nice place for a drink with friends  outdoor seating weather permitting so lots of room nothing fancy but good range of drinks  Easy location to find
If you dont  mind  the local  loonies  food  really  good  for price  so are the drinks  staff very friendly if you  like  sport ideal place  to go more televisions than Argos
Great place great atmpsphere good draft beer only giving 2 because i couldnt enjoy beeing longer there because of management inapropriate considerations who to serve I know he has all rights to choose who are beeing served and who not but i was completely sober when i walked in just very tired after working all day from 6am4pm my eyes looked tired and he might think i had been high on weed but i sayd to him im just tired and want few pints to relax He sayd i can get only 1 pint  anyways i was acting very quiet so there was no reason to dont serve me anymore while at the same time next to  our table was very drunk people acting very loud and uninvited came to our table started to have drunk empty  chat with questioning us  these people were very loud and clearly seen that been very drunk but they still been served  I think the manager should more apropriate consider who to serve and who not I dont see this fair that after long working day beeing tired willing to have relax but beeing disrespected  because of how my eyes look while others who are drunk can act how they want to
Fabulous food fantastic atmosphere and good lager My friend and I had a great time and also had the best steak pie and home made chips weve had anywhere in the UK
Lively bar with live music somedays Pub grub pretty good Only negative is the toilets are downstairs Definitely going back next time I am in the vicinity we loved the place
Great place to visit food is nice and plenty of choice for kids Big soft play centre inside but doesnt feel too noisy Staff very welcoming
Great pub good food lovely staff I had mussels in a cream sauce with bread and chips good portion size and tasty Nice beer gardens well kept Short walk to the most amazing beach which was nicely quiet and had a beach cafe and bar as well  This is on a bus route from StHelier as well as other places on the island Well recommended 
Spectacular spot and friendly staff but generally a bit disappointing The historic pub interior has gone for the dentists waiting room vibe and the food was mixed My pizza was inedible swimming in fat The moules were very nice though
Lovely meal outside on a sunny day The surroundings are beautiful  the food is superb The pizzagarlicbread starter was lovely which we shared my friends fish  chips looked great  I enjoyed the most delicious fish pie I have ever eaten 
Didnt get any food here but the staff were so friendly and helpful with table service and made us smile Definitely recommend this Irish pub They even gave us a free bowl of crisps and peanuts
Upscale but it feels like an Irish pub in London or Liverpool The Guiness is excellent and the staff are friendly and attentive It is big enough to have energy and activity Fries were excellent plenty of ketchup and portion was enormous If you are shopping on Via Nazionale or near Termini Station stop in for a pint Free WiFi
Good music but the waitress was too tired too listen our order So she gaves me the wrong one The ambience was the one of an Irish pubraw with a smell of old beer in the air
Im really sad that I cant leave a great review for this place ultimately the undercooked crispy chicken burger severely let the place down The waiter did offer to replace it but by the time he had come back to the table everyone had finished eating their meal some time ago and I felt too sick to try the chicken again No discount on the bill was offered which really would have stopped me from leaving a negative review as everything else was great Other than the chicken the atmosphere was great fries tasty my husband had a burger which he really enjoyed Food came very quickly maybe too quickly which probably explains the undercooked chicken the server was really friendly I would go again but Id stay away from the chicken Id probably just have snacksfries in future
I first went here in July 97 and i keep coming back  a proper pub for proper drinkers no cocktails with little umbrellas you want a pint this is where to go Good location can get busy  Football on the box pool table darts and sometimes great music
Brillant atmosphere and plenty of televisions indoor and outdoor to watch the final day of the Ryder Cup 2023 in golf that took place just outside Rome Lots of USA and Europe supporters present Service was quick and very efficient with staff being very friendly Prices very reasonable
We went here two days in a row and loved it there fair prices for drinks and the atmosphere is like no other Our favorite part was the ordering window they had outside
Very disappointed We came here and sat down in two seats which appeared to be free There were no coats bags empty glasses etc Two women came in after we sat at the bar for circa ten minutes and shouted Sean Sean who was the bar tender The women obviously wanted us to move They started shouting at us in a foreign language He kissed one of the women They made our time very uncomfortable and continued to intimidate us for the rest of our time there until we left It is disappointing that the bar tender clearly cares more about his relationship than the feelings of paying customers Would not recommend  STAY AWAY
Food and drinks were good Staff is super friendly Plenty of TVs to watch all different types of sport Overall great place to hang out and sink a few cold ones while watching your beloved team
A local bar that is very suitable for watching football games  Excellent selection of beers  The food menu is not big but tasty  Amazing atmosphere in the game we saw with many fans  We just have to improve the level of cleanliness more often both in the bar and in the toilets
Food was good the people where very nice prices where amazing And the temperature inside was nice  Felt cozy and home even on a holiday  Next time visiting Italy we definitely coming back
Cool cozy little pub not far from the Colosseum The staff seemed very friendly the atmosphere was fun and we met some really cool people here Would definitely go back
We stopped here for a random pint after watching the Ryder Cup at another pub Golf fans were still in good spirits so I managed to get a free drink from a fan who was buying some pints for everyone All in all good atmosphere for our random stop
Gets five stars for simply selling Harp lager  Friendly and inviting staff and did some decent irish whiskies  Great craic
Ill start by saying the Guinness is awful and the staff need training on how to pour a proper pint  In the hour we were there we saw so many people being turned away even though over 50 if the tables were empty reserved Im not sure why they would hold tables for so long and turn away so much walk in custom Anyone who did stay and stand ended up in on top of us and we had to ask one group to please move back Their bags were banging off us constantly  Overall Irish pub in name only
Like most Irish pub tend to be the ambiance was great The staff is very kind and speaks very good English too Ive spent a good chunk of the night joking with an American on vacation and the Nepalese barman  They have a wide variety of alcohol to choose from and they tend to be pretty cheap 5 to 7  I did not buy any food but it seemed pretty tasty and affordable  Conclusion  dont go there if you dont like having a good time
Awesome pub Traditional Workers speak great English too They have the games races and events posted  The drinks are what you would expect Many Americans seem to gather here There are seats at the bar which is hard to find in Italy I suggest sitting in the windows to people watch You are still in the bar and action but have a little bit of intimacy while having a view of the street too
Lively pubwent here couple of times Always something going on and a welcoming place for tourists definitely They have bingo nights too Food isnt the best but its not the worst if that can be a statement Ive had tortilla chips with guac and cheese and the melted cheese made the chips rubbery and soggy Better option are the burgersthey are a bit dry but considering its a pub you will have to order a beer with this All in all I like how cozy it is and it was a very chill atmosphere every time I went here So a good place to take a breather
Great atmosphere nice and welcoming service The food was tasty not bad at all for a Pub in Rome
The pub is great The atmosphere is awesome and the food is very very delicious The waiters are very kind and always helpful It is really nice place to hang out with your friends andor watch a game as they do show them When it gets very crowded the service is a bit slow which is to be expected but just something to keep in mind if youre really hungry when you get there 
A wonderful Irish style bar in this part of Rome The Pinsa was tasty and the service warm
Probably the most Italian Irish pub Friendly service food was a very pleasant surprise and definitely not classic pub food Highly recommended if you want good Irish beer and local Italian food
Very nice concept Irish and some Italian and international beers and mostly proper Italian food Fresh pasta tapas as a gift with my beer Cant complain Very impressed
Cosy place with great tasting and variety of food  Service was great and got good suggestions and was able to mix and match
Morrisons is an Irish pub surrounded by Italian cafes and restaurants Its a little out of place but thats what makes it a little charming Its a nice change from everything else Drinks are reasonable at 10 a cocktail or 6 and under for beer as of August 2023 The staff is great and super friendly On a slower shift the bartender even offered to make us something extra fresh because he was slow It really is a great spot to escape the heat or dive into with friends
Amazing place It is open from breakfast to late dinner The pasta Carbonara was delicious the best one in Rome
The food is good but thats where it ends Im afraid The only reason I gave the service 2 stars is for the sake of one nice waiter who genuinely wanted to help and one OK barman Overall the helpfulness of the staff and value for money would only deserve a minus rating
Not the typical breakfast place but it was well worth it The English breakfast menu was great with a full size tasty plate of eggs sausage bacon toast baked beans greens an orange juice and a lovely coffee Great service fast and friendly Bacon a bit on the salty side but Im used to eat low in salt  As I was still there closer to noon had a small glass of Session IPA at the end from the selection of local craft beers It was delicious Nerds Choice very fruity and light  Been here previously before Google time and never reviewed them Back again and very pleased still
Cool place I went there because Im a huge Highlander fan the 1986 movie with Christopher Lambert Didnt have much stuff about that but it is in a sub level Nice and cool during those HOT summer days in Rome Great cold beer too
Good pub for sport lovers only Not a good place for people who want to take a break from visiting Rome and have cold beer with some snack just like us  because there are 4 TVs and each TV shows a different football match according to customers requests and there is also high volume music in the place So it might be a little bit annoying to be among all those noise if you are not here to watch a match
We didnt eat here but stayed and watched the NFL games that day The Bartender was a Bears fan from Chicago like me We had a blast even with the Packers fans that sat next to us
Must visit Wonderful food and atmosphere The staff there make you feel at home and treat you like family There were four American football games on different TVs and everyone was enjoying good natured trash talking and fellowship
Nice place to chill the evening with friends and loved ones
Lousy The owner didnt give us menus They ONLY serve fast food type burgers with real fatty meat 12 euros Fries or salad 9 Euros extra but owner didnt say that The 6 of us could have eaten lousy fast food much cheaper but obviously that is not what we wanted 21 euros for cheap burger and small salad with no dressing Other restaurants close by have a variety of delicious food for much less like Lucianos mixed seafood grill for 15 euros absolutely delicious
Nice place
Nice place
Great place There is plenty of seating and very comfortable
the worst pub in the universe there is no choice of beer the kitchen they cook chicken wings in muesli this place is hell every Englishman who has sinned a lot after death gets into this pub
Excellent Irish style bar wirh a great drinks list Its a very warm atmosphere and perfect for a drink after a meal or just to hang out at The Ultimate Samurai was a great cocktail
Stopped in at the end of a long day for beer and dinner ordered a beer which was quite good but took around 15 minutes to be brought to the table which is silly for an Irish style pub I ordered a Morrison burger the flavour of said burger wasnt terrible however it was near completely raw chips were far too salty and the egg that came with the burger was also near raw and ended up spilling all over the table in the time it took for me to start eating The plating was ludicrously small basically nonexistent especially for food so messy  Service was terrible and the staff was ignorant when going in to pay and the server did nothing to help after I had eaten only one small bite realized it was RAW and stopped eating out of disgust Not even 5 off Silly  After a few days of incredible food in Rome I have finally found myself disappointed  Avoid avoid avoid I absolutely do not recommend this spot
Tired of pizza Eat here   The bunless hamburgers with Scottish beef are popular   The beer selection is great and small glasses are an option  The pastas are also popular and done well  We came on a Friday night about 8pm and live music was playing
We were exhausted and just wanted to eat a proper meal that was not italian D  Thats when we came across this irish pub which offers 10 euro menu that includes main course side dish cola and water or some similar variations and honestly it was worth it It is super cheap and you have a meal and a drink so I think its great value for money especially considering its in the city center  Of course the food is not super amazing but I was satisfied  So if you want some change of pace in the middle of Rome and want to save some money im the process worth checking out  For the sheer value of this place I give it 5 stars
Came here for beer to escape the heat for a while Very nice authentic Pub with friendly staff and good air conditioning Strong recommendation did not eat so for that reason no review of the food
Nice atmosphere Nice people Great place to rest a bit after a long touring day
Every time I was in the pub there were not a lot of issues maybe just slower service if I really had to complain I really like the beers in the pub and the food is also great but yesterdays situation with the waiter who mixed up drinks and then wanted my friend to drink from the glass that another person already drank out of ruined the experience for me We had to tell the waiter multiple times to bring her a new beer because she shouldnt drink after somebody who got her drink by mistake at another table And it was not a missunderstandning we speak both english and italian
We came here for breakfast and coffee It was amazing and affordable Large portions and very tasty Coffee  croissant  wonderful Employees are really kind We loved this place
My friend ordered a beer and it was given to someone else When she pointed out the mistake the waiter took the drink and gave it to her expecting she would accept it after the guy already drank from it Not only is it rude but also very unhygienic and careless especially after going through a world pandemic We are very disappointed after this experience
Excellent food friendly staff and conpetitely priced A good pint if Guinness too Beware of ordering burgers for an evening meal They look good taste great but are enormous unless you have an equally enormous appetite Be careful if the bruschetta  again taste great but the bread base could pose problems with your teeth The breakfast croissants are exceptional especially the vegan orange one All in all excellent place visited every day of our visit except Monday when it is closed
We went here after arriving late at night in Rome The owner is very nice and loves what he does The pasta we had was amazing as well Thanks 
A gem of a place nice food and drink choices Had a lovely last drink with the ownerbarkeeper Definitely will come back
Very nice pub  the ribs is delicious
Great place we found just down the street from the apartment we rented for the week Friendly staff and great food  My fiances pasta was actually quite good Better than a few of the local traditional spots Great drink selection and the tiramisu was on point
Lovely traditional Irish bar with very good Guinness on draught for 650 Sport on TV and plenty of seating
What a lovely experience we had here The staff could not have been kinder and more accommodating  We went in to watch the Liverpool game and it was a lovely atmosphere The drinks were great and the gentleman behind the bar made us some delicious toasties and nothing was too much trouble for him a lovely duo behind the bar Also my girlfriend was delighted to see Gordans Pink Gin on the menu Its not easy to find in Rome and to please a fussy girlfriend The Guiness was lovely too
Great bartender and awesome This is the first Irish bar in Rome opened in 1976 this was our first visit Were from the United States and we had a great time and a Guinness
One of my mustvisit places every time Im in Rome  about 9 trips so far Nice place to cool off or warm up and relax with a Guinness See you next year hopefully
Full of alcoholic homelesslooking crowds that scream and laugh until very late hours in the street0400 AM Annoying and have no respect for the neighbours whatsoever Everyone wants to have fun sometimes but do it at a proper time
We were seeking refuge in Rome and stumbled upon this Irish bar What ensued was arguably one of the funnest nights ever Great bar great people great vibes
Unfortunately wasnt open Visited Saturday at 1845 Wont give 1 star as havent been able to experience it properly
We visited on a Thursday night around 7 and it was very quiet This meant there was little atmosphere which was ashame because it did have the vibes of being banging bar if more people were in As it was our last night we did move on having said we would come back next time we were in Rome Service was great staff friendly and helpful I do want to experience it again when more people are in There was a reasonable selection of beers and price was inline with other bars in the area
Really like this because it was like a pub bar had a few draught lagers Guinness and the like Good friendly staff enjoyed a couple of good nights in here Thank you to the staff
I dropped in here to wait for a bus and didnt want to leave Spent the whole evening chatting with Tom and various visitors best Guinness Ive had outside of eire and he knows how to pour Top fella Thank you Instagram jimhussey
Great place lovely pint of Guinness Friendly bar guys stayed late and someone played the piano Very fun
Easy going small and nice atmosphere Lively because of football but in the good way Need to visit again next time I visit Rome I recommend this place 
I love this small place friendly and food is amazing taste portion and price with big beer and big screen for watching footballlove it
A very good pub located close to the Cornelia underground station Perfect for an aperitif with colleagues after work or for a night with friends tasting great beers and nice food The staff is friendly and the place is cozy and laid back Its possible to listen to good music or see football matches Take a look yourself
Very nice Irish pub Good quality of food and beers Amazing staff Dont forget to try bistecca Alla Guinness
This Irish pub is really cool quiet and cosy It offers a good selection of meals mainly pizza on wooden shovel and hamburgers It has a great selection of beers I like to get the beer tasting selection composed of four 15 cl glasses of different beers You can watch sport games here as well in which case the place may become noisy
Nice Irish pub to have some food Good selection of tap beers but everything is commercial Do not expect craft beers here Good atmosphere to chat with friends The food is OK but not the best pasta that you can find in Rome In our case bread was stale dry and hard Most likely had couple of days or it was a bad quality bread
What an awesome place The staff was amazing the food was good and the drinks well worth it If I could change anything it would be perhaps add a dart board or something to engage other patrons as it was full of life with both young and old
Super cool experience Our waiter was speaking French and was very nice Food is good and drinks as well
Nicolette the bartender was the best bartender Ive had in so long  Me and my boyfriend travel endlessly and she was so attentive friendly and her drinks were my favorite part of Rome If youre looking for a down to earth delicious and late food and drink place THIS is your spot  Thank you Nico  
Very good trad session Thursday nights
Had a lovely last night in Rome in pub Staff very friendly and attentive Only gripe lager German and not Celtic Missus loved it too do take the ladies
Nice place with a very friendly barkeeper Several very good beers from the tap And a really good Grappa 
10 stars Owner will pretend he doesnt want customers but is actually a sweetheart
Very nice staff and lots of beers to choose from Its a local pub in a working class area but dont be afraid to visit if youre a tourist
Place looks amazing inside staff is friendly and the beer is top quality for all tastes
Cozy and friendly irish pub with friendly staff and great beers
Nice staff good for a beer after dinner
A very special corner of Milan our host his wife and the team behind the bar are very friendly and made us feel very welcome The fish and chips were very special as was the pasta The Guinness just topped off a couple of legendary visits to Mulligans I will go out of my way to visit there next time Im in Milan
The owner is very passionate and knowledgeable about all things whisky If you are a whiskey fan make sure to visit
A nice irish bar in Milan There you can find Kilkeeny  my favourite beer  because in Milan other irish pubs dont use it Staf was very prepared Perfect place to have a good beer and to eat something The people who frequented it were about 3060 years old
You cannot go wrong coming here Amazing service amazing beer and whisky and great atmosphere Hands down my favorite pub in Milan Make sure to ask for Gabrielle he is amazing and so kind
Nice bar for a quick pit stop when crusing Navigli Martesa They accept digital payments so you are ok Nice beer and ice cream also
3 stars are for the pizzaThe pizza was delicious no doubt about it But I ordered at 930 pm and it at 1030 Ok it is Saturday night but if they know there are more customers on Saturdays better to think about more cooks Pizza gets ready in 10 minuteswhat are the other 50 minutes wasted for
Top
A great place for DARTS food Sports bar Pizza
Awesome and fun place Lots going on during the week and fun place to go on the weekend Surprising amount of parking available in the streets to the south and east a few streets Good time
This is the Pub no much else to say if you know what having a good time at a pub means then just come over here Great atmosphere great beers and great service Specially the guy with the green hair very professional even though he looks like a little marmotta with some issues Strongly suggested
Awful experience Staff not helpful and also an uncooked meal served in the first instance
Great variety of beer but also served cocktails  Nice place to spend some time with friends
Its a good place for spending time with friends and the aperitivos quality is good compared to its price
Nice not expensive at all englishold style pub right in front of Polimi The food is good but maybe the place need a renewal since its a little bit rusty
Tasty and Filling food friendly service Gets crowded during lunch hours But worth the wait
Very quiet but a nice pub  Would be good to see it lively
The quality has been decreased The fish and chips were non cooked correctly a bit raw in the middle And the nachos were fried twice and the melted cheddar was just a hard sheet of some cheese The chicken wing where really good but there are none assorted sauces like blue cheese for ex
A nice addition to the Pogue Mahones family A very nice restaurant with pub food aplenty We went during offpeak hours so the service was very attentive and kind We had a very honest lunch with a burger and a pinsa which is basically a rectangular pizza The decor is what you expect from a pub which is simple and familiar yet comfy
We went there as tourists ordered 2 pizzas and got 2 pizzas burned By making the waitress realize this she offered us an exchange so we had to wait againBecause they thought we are just tourists they did not even bother to put salt and pepper on our table The pizzas we ordered Nostromo  Vegetariano were not tasty at all and on Nostromo they used too less onion and tuna Ridiculous
Food was lovely and the decor inside is very very homely It doesnt feel like a fake Irish bar like a lot of Irish pubs feel like outside of Ireland
I have to overnight once in a while in Milano San Donato and last time I found this amazing Pub through a local friend Great beers on tap and amazing bar buffet Looking forward to being back there
Excellent Irish pub Enjoy your burger with Jameson Whiskey and grap an IPA beer Are you into rockmetal music They have it Multiple TV screens keeps you updated on sport And back for 2nd time May22
Usually we go for apperetivo which costs 10 But if you order another drink beer or cocktail until 2100 you will have to pay 10 again because its apperetivo time
First time in here and I will definitely come back Its a bit hidden from the road but once in you find a nice environment you also have access to music tv etc where you can either go for just a drink or eat as well I had a Ciney Brune and a Banshee Burger Both highly recommended Had a lovely evening with friends

One of the good pubs in Milan for those who enjoy a good pint It has plenty of space and most times when outside its not too cold we usually prefer to have a drink outside Only downside is that when it gets crowded and it does so the service is pretty slow
Cozy little pub with great selection of draft beer Place was packed at 630 and we took our food and drinks outside and mingled Had a great time In a great location near downtown Milan
Worst pub of my life And talking about all these good reviewsseriously guys Whats the matter with you Have you ever been in a decent and irish pub  Junk food if that could be considered food at all and even the sauces were expired
Not bad very small wish there was a band or something Irish like there more seating downstairs though
A great place for beer round the corner of Loreto via Padova Good collection of beer and very good appetisers We went early evening and was not so much crowded but gets crowded late in the evening
Best pub ever The beer is top A width choice of sorts Nice atmosphere The staff is friendly And everybody speaks English  With first drink you will get also a free pizza  and chips 
Cheers What a great pub in Milan Cheapest Guinness we have found in Italy accompanied with the best aperitivos Swing in and indulge
Awesome place 4 beer in Milan
I like the design and also the staff drinks were great and friendly I recommend this place The accessibility is better only with car
Cool little spot to grab a beer We stopped in when we were unable to find the place we were looking for but we were not disappointed They had some good beer on tap and were extremely friendly We came in before they were serving Pizza but we had a really tasty salad and bread sticks instead which held us over until dinner
We have been to the pub several times so far for breakfast both during the week and on weekends The service is fast and the staff attentive Great coffee bar and brioche High ranking for the possibility of ordering salty brioche very rare in Italian bars
Went for lunch Good food the meal was prepared fast
The Ghost Pub in Milan is a unique and cozy pub The menu offers delicious Italian and international dishes and the pub has a quirky ghostly theme that adds to its charm The friendly service and creative ambiance make it a mustvisit spot for a fun and memorable dining experience in Milan Highly recommended
The Ghost Pub  one  of the best in Milano 
Lovely place  great pint of Guinness excellent food beautiful staff  cant wait to get back there 
British pubs in the outskirts of the city great selection of beers and food I recommend this place for nostalgics like me The only disappointment is the outside area I wish you could do better to improve urban decor
I liked the vibe Staff were nice Enjoyed the time when i was there
Great place to drink some beers very friendly staff
6euro for 2 pints of beer Decor was a little tired but I knocked 2 stars off for the horrendous booths The springs and foam made me feel like sitting in a beanbag chair Very uncomfortable Service and beer were good though I recommend sitting in a wooden chair
Super nice place
Man man man this was not good The food was to cry The grilled vegetables were like what i expect of them in my nightmares Rubbish and tasted like rubber We didnt get cutlery with our burgers and the burgers didnt have any sauce on them It smelled like stinky socks at our table but that could also be my dads feet The only vegetarian option was a wrap with just rocket on it Fantastic I should end on a positive note well i cant complain about the still water
Cool cozy bar to have a few beers and watch some football at When I went on a weekday night in October it was all locals and I was the only foreigner there They have one TV outside for outdoor seating and one TV inside Decent beer selection for a local bar as well The employees were very friendly and one of the younger employees even spoke English very well so communication was no problem Its also open late on weekdays which is great I definitely recommend this bar
I went here late at night to have a couple beers with my colleagues The place was good Nothing to complain Not too many people when I was there Beers are good
Very friendly staff who went above and beyond to help us They accommodated us last minute for the World Cup final match and had a great atmosphere
Love this place Guinness is really good You have to order at the counter but its not a bother Staff is really friendly
Irish pub with a nice craic Gets packed at later hours of the day It has a good selection of beer and pub food
Very nice pub Exelent food drinks and people
Lovely atmosphere well done Irish pub Beer A
Nice place with nice music prices are good its perfect for spending time with friends and having fun for the evening Really recommend this bar and food is also too nice 
Although the prices are little higher than the average the service is cool I deducted one star because I didnt like their Bloody Mary cocktailperson opinion
Very nice and particular Irish kinda location with nice staff They have screens for soccer games  I tasted only Campari soda homemade which was with low sparkling soda ok but fair price
Great staff big smile and greatest vibe love it
Came here for UEFA Champions League Final there was so crowded Foods are delicious and able to make you full They have a lot of drink variant especially Beer The beer are great too Thing that makes me  disappoint is the service they still need improvement or hire extra man for rush hour
Really enjoyed my time at this pub We visited 3 nights in a row as our apartment was 5 mins walk a way The range of different beers were better than most in Milan The prices are reasonable for the type of beer they sell Food was okay but really busy the night we ordered food In all honesty we werent blown away by the food in Milan or Lake Como This pub is definitely worth a visit Bravo
Ive been there to watch fiorentina  Milan Never been to a pub in Milan Very nice experience with drought beer only Italy and chicken wings Beer is too expensive service was excellent
I would give 0 stars if I could They advertise everywhere a happy hour of 50 off between 58pm after spending 3 hours we went to pay the bill and was full price And at the end they told us that its only 50 off if you take the beer from the bar Despite them offering to bring us the beers to the table disgraceful
Very busy so wouldnt make cocktails Very slow service but nice place
Proper bar at a proper price Also a good selection of food all with great service
What a nice place to be No matter what football fan you are they are always welcoming you Also the panini and beer are outstanding I can just highly recommend it to everybody
Ive been there for lunch with some friends The staff is rude and really not friendly On top of that all of us agreed on the fact the food wasnt good enough cheap ingredients and prepared on a rush without any attention or love Not recommended especially considered the other waaaay better spotscafes for a quick bite or a beer that you could find all around
Best local hang out bar in the area Their goal is for you to chat with patrons and enjoy yourself not to take your money Just go
Top
Quite hidden found it almost by mistake but definitely a cool place Good selection of beer and friendly staff and the location is nice aswell Definitely recommended
Nice bar Enjoyed the drinks Food looks beautiful I must try next time Brilliant owners
The food tasted great We ordered the chicken sticks meatballs cheesesteak and mozarella balls  There was a misunderstanding with our order which is most likely due to language barrier we dont speak italian and the waitress did not understand english We ordered cheesesteak with a side of fried mozarella but the waitress misunderstood and  mozarella cheese was used on the cheesesteak They corrected the order woth a replacement cheesesteak with no cheese and we received the fried mozarella and it was still cold on the inside but they gave us replacement for take away
I do not recommend We ordered two Leffe beers 033 On leaving the waitress asked to pay 10 euros for them The most expensive in the area
12 euro for two beers obviously because we were touristsas Irish As a Chinese fisherman
They obviously had a credit card machine and I was told they only take cash  And they ended up making us pay in cash
Small well set up pub We went for lunchFausto is kind and welcoming discreet attentive to cleanliness he disinfected the table in front of us Delicacies of all kinds and generous portions I would like to point out the bacon and cheddar chips split between 2 but the portion was fine for 3 people The bruschettone with scapece courgettes chicken strips and cheddar is excellent I didnt take photosgo and try it it wont disappoint you We stayed at Faustos again reconfirming everything with an exceptional price 2 plates bread and bottle of water 15 euros
Absolutely a musttry place Initially it may seem small but once you sit at the table a world opens up Very fresh and quality food freshly prepared with an overflowing sandwich excellent starters Fausto is a really nice and kind guy who gives you meticulous advice on every single dish I absolutely recommend him Really competitive prices Super value for money I recommend it
First of all what characterizes this pub is the friendliness of the owner and his collaborators truly welcoming and engaging even if you have never been there you dont feel like a stranger and you are pampered in every way the menu is very clear and detailed  leaves no room for misunderstandings about prices or ingredients cleanliness is TOP but the best quality of GoldBlack is certainly that of the products used for the preparations all fresh and if necessary homemade there is nothing precooked if you are lucky you may happen to come across some evening where very high level musicians perform GoldBlack at Faustos is a place where you can even end up by chance but it is certainly a place where you return with pleasure because you always return to where you had a good time
Ive been to this restaurant and despite an overall sufficient menu I spent too much money Staff were soso furthermore from the bathrooms you could hear a person shouting or speaking a language mixed between Russian Polish Ukrainian and Bulgarian and a few words in Belarusian
Who orders a burger in Naples People who live in Naples  This place is much better than expected Setup is actually like an Irish pub  I was hoping on a long shot they would have Sheppards pie or corned beef and cabbage  They did not  So I ordered the Johnny burger and I gotta say that it is the best burger Ive had out in town so far  Overall I recommend this place as something different than just pizza pasta and croissants
Overrated Theme is incorrect Just another pub but for celiac adults is okay for 1 time and pricey No children menu either
Rushed here from central Naples as someone said they might be showing English football They were wrong Nice enough place very spacious and no question for the bar
No irish beer on tap and cricket pads on display as you walk in not the most well known irish game
Good pub in the posh area of Naples The place is not really big Prices in the average of the area
Fantastic   Panini  Sandwich Very High Quality  I was very impressed

Wonderfull
unique unforgettable experience I recommend the Luciana octopus refined and traditional at the same time chef Giorgios magical touch is unique not to mention the Genoese what can I say True and pure traditiona perfect dish Excellent service the owner was courteous and kind we will return tomorrow for other dishes
Excellent pub that also offers first and second courses as well as sandwiches Owner very kind and always available Sandwiches are big and tasty Ideal not only for take away but also for consuming on the spot in an Irish pub environment 5 stars
Excellent experience we are at homeBaby bottle the chef and number 1
And the first time we came the sandwiches are delicious the staff is friendly the chef is small but cooks well the pub is particular and nice The owners are very friendly the prices are very affordable we will return
Just like an authentic Irish Pub The service was great
One of the best pub in the city I know some people that worked in the kitchen and in a lot of others pub of the city and they said that is the cleanest kitchen that they have ever seen
Top
Pub of Fuorigrotta now historic Ive been going there for years and I must say that as far as the food is concerned it has always been of high quality I usually come here with friends to drink the legendary kbirr Neapolitan beer this Pub is one of those that has this beer on tap Too bad that last time he didnt find the beer we wanted and the food we requested because unfortunately its already finished In the place you can breathe the real pub air just a pity that in its heyday it was better stocked and with a more convivial atmosphere Lets hope those times return
One of the best burgers i had in a loong time
Exellent service nice crew amazing almost beyond perfect food They have glutenfree buns for burgers they have Guinness on the tap they speak english what more do you need  Strongly recommended
When you walk into an Irish pub and Mario is your bar man no irish beers here If you want some belgian beers go ahead
Good experience but if it is a Irish bar i guess all the workers could speak English not only one
Poor service
If you want to drink and eat discreetly a stones throw from Piazza Plebiscito it is the ideal place excellent beer
my favorite place every time I have time available I go there 
Wonderful location A stones throw from the castle of the Ovo beautiful and themed place exquisite products and very kind staff super recommended
Genuine Irish Pub selling whole range of great draught beers and stouts Furbished as a genuine Irish pub with tables and benches and a great menu I hadnt enjoyed a pint of Harp Lager since the 1970s Staff were really friendly as well and the music was Irish as well
What a great little pub if your into the Hobbits you will have a blast The food was spot on home made burgers a must Prices are on the nail as well Only down side was the menu was all in Italian but the staff are really helpful plus google translate
Quirky place Lord of the rings theme very friendly and accommodating bar staff
Stumbled across this place It was AWESOME Really good food and I love the atmosphere
Came to watch the Chelsea game only to find the other champions league match was broadcasted instead Still I had a great time because the owner was so accommodating and the beer very good despite us not being able to communicate due to language barrier In conclusion I highly recommend this place the service was the best Ive had on trips abroad  and Ive been to plenty other countries before Italy  Belissimo
Frank is one of my best mates He can make u feel like home like no one else  hes got one of the widest beers choice in Naples and his kitchen is always open I would celebrate every inch of my time in here 
Very nice bar with friendly people Has a big variaty of tap beer Been there for a Napoli game had a wonderfull experiance 
Great pub lots of options for beer the waitress  who was the only one around the night we were there  was very friendly and patient  even with us not understanding a word of Italian
Beer was phenomenal as to be expected from a irish pub
Just having a Guinness on tap heaven While I didnt have any food hereit did smell amazing
Rude waiter and no Irish food whatsoever The stew you see in the photos was only in winter I felt a little like a trespasser Quite uncomfortable Hidden service charge of 150
Half Irish no wine no Bacardi good beerexcellent  staff were very friendly and even gave me a napoli scarf as I am a Man City fan So cheers to Flannerys
Nice late night relaxed beats
Cool place Friendly staff
Enjoyed it
Good price quality Nice tidy outdoor gazebo with good spaces between the tables Large centered screen for music or football match Too bad its closing early
The service was great Good job girls The only dissapointment was the cheese steak It  was  full  with  peperoni and on the menu it doesnt say it comes with peperoni The rest of the food was ok  Nice pub
A supposed english pub with no english menu The steak was dry burnt and oversalted The fries were overcooked and also oversalted
The food was good but the service was a bit slow
Top
Quiet spot where to enjoy a sunny day while sipping some good white wine  Quiet by day very busy and crowded by night
Friendly staff good service but I wouldnt class it as an Irish pub
I visited in February and it was pretty quiet everywhere in Naples in terms of nightlife Everywhere was closing earlier than their typical opening hours  Saint James Pub closed two hours early but we were literally the only customers left by 1am despite that the staff were really nice and didnt rush us  A little rough around the edges building a little run down but no more than some of the older bars in Ireland Guinness on Tap  Live football matches on show  Decent cocktails 6 each  Small Indoor and decent size outdoor seating free crisps and peanuts when you drink Only one bathroom unisex
We had a good time at the pub with a nice view of the piazza The drinks were nice and the service very fast
Very nice pub and great people
A looong wait  I was in this pub on 28 December 22 we were 8 people for dinner and we waited so long before eating that at a certain point we thought they had forgotten about us The dishes finally arrived I had ordered a sandwich with hamburger bacon and potatoes the potatoes cold and dry for who knows how many days without talking about the bacon that was on my boyfriends hamburger and in my sandwich cold and not at all tasty  I give three stars to this place for two reasons 1 two of the people at my table were satisfied 2 the place has a good reputation maybe the staff wasnt at the top that evening 
Beautiful experience the place is extremely welcoming the musical choices are fantastic and super spot on I really appreciated the food with a truly vast choice of appetizers sandwiches and wraps Entering Tartan seems like entering a small corner of Great Britain but in reality we are simply in Volla A nice place to gather with friends I highly recommend it
Quiet place furnished in Scottish style good food
Great little pub for watching sport and getting some cheap food and drinks Nothing fancy but great location and great service
Open till 2am  best place to chill out 
Irish type pub  Which are not easy to find in naples
Not open
Excellent pub in Naples with very good quality of food great burgers fries sausages even deserts were excellent We enjoyed a lot on our visit to Naples
We came to here from Israel and its absolutely one of the best restaurants in vomero for sure alongside blackwood restaurant Highly suggest the burgers chicken skewers The crepe Nutella is also of high quality just like in France Im French myself
Super friendly staff in this pub that serves nice tap beers Genuinely asking where you are from what you are doing in Naples etc Nice Rock music not too loud Small outdoor space I didnt try the food but it looked good from other tables I recommend paying a visit if you hang out in Vomero neighbourhoods 
this is the place to be if you want to enjoy a good burger in naples Fries and  beers are amazing
After more than 20 years Ive returned to the Pub that has seen me grow upO Pub and don Mim Today there is Ciro who has been working there since he was 16 first as a waiter and then as owner Excellent food beer  ditto  Chapoo at the First Pub in the area north of Naples
We ordered two takeout sandwiches 1 Maradona and 1 personalized Excellent product quality and very punctual home delivery service indeed even in advance Advised
Good Overall good sandwiches but tasting the Hamburger alone I was so disappointed that I didnt even eat it I had a Marina sandwich The other was the Big ciro and then a potato with porchetta Whatever conclusions the Wuuuaauu didnt start I will go back hoping to change my mind and maybe add a star
There are so many beers available and the owner is very knowledgeable about beers so as to recommend both based on taste and with the combination of sandwich  pizza  pita In my opinion the best sandwiches are the Big Ciro but the Superbomba isnt bad either For the more courageous I also recommend trying Poker Fast service and quiet place
Avoid this bar if you are a tourist Today when i ordered my beer i showed the happy hour advert  and i was charged 11 ish euros for 2 beers 8 was the price
What a wonderful place They have a lot of beers and you can even drink good red wine Dont miss it
Food was very tasty  Plenty of screens if you want to watch matches too
We came to this place seeing the reviews It was such a nice welcoming place the waiters speaks English and they help you out The food and beers were good Prices fine Crowded and busy place
Only popped in for a quick beer Meteor a French Blanche beer which was nice
Nice Irish style pub close to center of the cityGood beer options and kitchen great for football lovers
Very nice place casual good rockmetal music and excellent choice of whiskey
Great staff and welcoming people Great little bar
The ambient was really good We went to the karaoke Thursday and had a lot of fun The staff was polite and the prices are regular It was a bit sad though that the stopped putting our songs in the screen without an explanation The karaoke can definitely be better organized
Great place to have a beer IPA Lagunitas and a bite in the evening after the football They have screens and follow the main football and rugby competitions
On our way home from the eurovision village it looked like it was the only place open late at night nearby Friendly staff although Im not entirely sure how we managed to spend 50 for 3 aperol spritz 2 gt and a mixed platter of fried things
Good pub They serve nice sandwiched and fried appetizers Pretty good beer selection
We have been in this place with my friendsatmosphere was nicefood was goodwe take our own order and paid it and bring our drinks on our tablebut it is not nicely way when customers were still eatingand the waiters continue to ask if they can take the plate out Maybe they want  us to go and leave the place soon because with that attitude they put stress in every people who want to stay still 
A bit worried with the plastic table and chairs outside but a really local place with great pizza and Aperol also salads and sweets You order like a proper English man at the bar taking your drink and waiting for your food to be served Really polite personel great location next to the central bus station
Excellent grilled veal and chicken chop for dinner The buttered spinach was a good side to go with the chicken Though the medium rare veal could be less cooked it was very tasty anyways
Me and my partner ate here tonight on the last night of our holiday and it was honestly the best pizza AND pasta we have had all week We are both from Scotland and we loved all the Scottish memorabilia around the pub All of the staff were extremely helpful and kind even though we knew no Italian which we appreciated a lot Also even though it was a busy Friday night the service was fast and the food came in good time again being the best food we had eaten all week We cant wait to come back one day  grazie mille dalla Scozia
Self service place for drinks only The ambience is good as of an old Irish pub But I must say random people selling stuff enter through the side doors which I found pretty weird
Really friendly staff great live music and reasonable prices We went for Paddys day and had so much fun Only negative are the womens toiletsa hole in the floor See picture
Chatty staff burgers and chips were great prices decent
Cozy Irish pub with characters inside and behind the bar Marco is a star bartender who treated us to a great time and connected us to other English speakers there Fries are pretty good too Lots of laughs Great music and they take requests Make sure to sketch an eye for their wall Ps We love you Marco
Amazing place great characteristic and folk feel Food is special and tasty A very fine selection of beers on tap Personnel is kind and fast Really big place with fine arts a typical ScottishIrish feel from tapestry to tables and stools with dim lights and good music Highly recommend
Went there today Sunday and nobody was inside   F1 from Netherlands was on TV which I wanted to see   Sat there for an hour with noone else and had two pints    Then they started putting stickers on all the chairs around me to reserve the area   Then immediately changed the channel to European Football and I was still on my own   No word why  The F1 GP only had 4 laps to go   Never again you miserable mugs
Excellent venue felt like a genuine bar in Ireland the beer alas wasnt great and the bar service not on the mark for an Irish bar but well worth a visit
Entrecte was really good Same for the beer Staff very friendly Shame they were no atmosphere I expected to see few people for Liverpool ManU game but was on my own Few people for the Italian game
Delicious ribs and good range of beers There is this Hob House 13 beer I really recommend you to try
Very nice bar While their Long Island Ice Tea is done not very well White Russian is good
Food is great  I was there early and not crowdedThey take credit card Limited English but very helpful
Great place and atmosphere Open also on Mondays



Great place to grab a pint
Good service and food food
Very poor service
Brilliant local pub Thanks so much for putting Eurovision on for us yesterday the atmosphere was fantastic
I love this pub Great service and food Friendly staff reasonable prices and free WiFi  Outside seating with TV screens perfect for watching the world cup
Great little pub actual pub  not a bar  cafe with reasonably priced drinks Tennents on special for 3 Good service and loved the music
Quick beer on way through town to watch football
Overall its a nice bar the beer are good but the food took very long to arrive and wasnt as tasty  In fact the service was a bit long when the bar was almost empty
Ate here twice wasnt disappointed great food to go with a beer cool atmosphere on the weekends and all the sports I expected was on TV
Amazing place to get any type of Italian dish  a quick bite or nice lunchdinner alone or with friends The price is very reasonable although a bit higher than average There is a wide variety of beers and pizzas to choose from You can watch games as well as play billiard and there are countless seats available if you are in a big group
Great sports pub in the centre of Turin Good food and drink choices
Very good variety and quality of beers It gets noisy at times but overall its very good It has a room with a pool table foosball darts etc
Not bad for a small restaurant Fair price decent meal too 
THE BEST BREWERY
Not bad
Great pub for hangout they have good discounts and the ambiance is nice It is also possible to watch sports matches here Convenient for Uni students
Pretty good pub always full with people but as lomg as you can find a place to sit youre gonna enjoy your drink
Youth friendly place The right place to have fun with your friends You could have some promotions on the drinks
Had a nice dinner with a Caesar Salad and enjoyed the usual Open Mic Standup Comedy on Monday evening a lot
Nice place Good drink good food and good service
What a great little spot owners are fab and omg dont be fooled by this little bar it has the BEST pizza in the whole of italy actually all the food is amazing here LOVE THESE GUYS
Nice Vibes Cool and Friendly service
Nice beer and happy stpatrick in advance
Not enough choice of beer in a pub its strange The place is normal Prices are correct Maybe I will try something else
Delicious Hamburgers Good service AmericanItalian style
After being turned away at the Eurovision Village after it filled up earlier than expected  my husband and I were wandering the streets of Turin not as bad as it sounds in search for somewhere to watch the final live show We came to the Overbridge Pub and not only did we get seats but great seats and great service The staff works so hard and naturally the place is packed Drinks and food is still served promptly and with a smile Would def go again
Everything was great  I had tried a few starters and beers and really NOTHING could beat this place The staff were super friendly and very fluent in English so I really had a very great time there I would recommend it for sure One of the best pubs in Turin   Grazie mille per avermi ospitato  
Expensive beer double the price than other places
Good place friendly staff good drinks and food
Great food and great craft beers selections
Quiet popular Englishstyle pub located in a beautiful street in Santa Rita Quiet area and frequented by kids families groups of friends it has a part of the brewery inside with table football and darts outside there is a large outdoor area The owner very kind You can order everything from beer to a dish to enjoy together a chat and laugh in company
Very nice place a country decoration that set you in a western mood and a very friendly bartender However he does not speak english
Best beer joint in town ever with the best music and the friendliest staff
Maurizio is the best
Little corner of USA in Turin Maurizio is a super host and youll feel at home in a matter of nothing Country music all the time cash only no credit cards
Very rude staff we reserved a table via google and when we were there they asked us to change the table and move our things and they sent us to an other tablewhich was awful and they gave our table to a couple when we asked them the reason they said because we didnt order any food worst experience in Italy  very disrespectful
Ive been here Thursday evening at 10PM Many tables available but then it quickly filled up Nonetheless the noise level never grew too loud and I could still hear the nice background music Being able to talk and not shout is not something to take for granted in a crowded place even more so among Italians  You order at the counter but you pay when you leave which is my favourite method you dont have to wait for busy understaffed waiters but you also dont have to reach for coins every half an hour Im talking about coins because a medium Weiss beer was just 35  Clean bathroom with the sink separated for the WC so you dont have to wait if you just want to wash your hands before you eat
A busy pub but they can manage its a small area but its cozy and nice  the owner are very accomodating and everyones busy at bar 
Pretty nice Irishstyle pub with wood furniture and walls full of stuff The supply of beer and food is very good too overall recommended
Not your typical irish bar as it is mixed in with a large dose of fantasy mainly LOTR However they do all the standard Irish pub things you would expect The food is a spin on IrishBritish but isnt really either Still they do some decent bar grub and burgers by the looks of it BBQ wings in a bucket seems to be extremely popular with the locals Staff were friendly good service and reasonable prices
Good value bar and is a little bit different We enjoyed some cocktails and beers here and the staff were very friendly
Great beer selection Kilkenny on draft as well as an IPA Friendly service When youre in search of an Irish pub this is a good choice for Palermo
Checked this place out on my last night in Palermo and lucked into a live rock band  my first time hearing RR in Italian and I think some of the songs actually had an Irish lilt to them Had a great time enjoying the crach and spotting Lord of the Rings mementos  They could use some coaching on how to pour Guinness but it was still a pleasant and delicious surprise
Good choice of beers and amazing setting There were some musicians at the terrace and everyone was dancing and having fun One of the best bars we did in Palermo
Really good cocktails  loved the Moscow Mule Buzzing atmosphere
Nice place to hang out outdoors They have lice music and they give out free appetizers some times Service is friendly and very fast Not a lot of choice of beer but the make any cocktail you want
Nice location Drinks are cheap and its full of young people and students Definitely go there if you want to socialize around a drink in the evening during your trip Good music And you can enjoy the beautiful piazza around
Dilapidated hole

Okay bar but has definitely nothing to do with an Irish pub And they only cash though pretty much every place you can pay by card
Friendly staff  speak a little Italian and they are quite friendly Drinks were strong and worth it Had a nice Monkey Gin and Tonic I dont know whether they are supposed to be an Irish Pub as would be the name but damn they have a class bar tender
Good coffee  and nice food  And sooo cheap 
Great place to have a drink and something to eat staff are very professional its a pleasure to spend an evening there
Love this place The food service and atmosphere is amazing
Ok
But everything ok We went for dinner a group of 10 people Soso food cheap and expensive pizzas Waiting for an hour and a half they completely forgot a pizza one was brought burnt you ordered 4 cans and one arrived waiters who bump into customers several times dirty dishes that remain on the table with the other courses already you arrive owners discussing animatedly with the employees in front of the customers For the place and the prices you offer one expects a service 10 times better than this
L unica nota positiva  la cantate che con il tributo ad Elisa ci ha veramente soddisfatto Cibo pessimo hamburger andato a male  qualit bassissima Non capisco come mai un locale  non ci tenga a fare bella figura con i clienti ma pensa solo a dare m in pasto pur di guadagnare Non ci torno pi cos come tutti i miei amici  Abbiamo rimandato indietro tutti gli hamburger Mi spiace non faccio mai recensioni cos negative ma mi sembra giusto farla per fare si che il locale migliori sempre pi 




Really friendly staff put the Brighton Europa league game on for us when we couldnt find it anywhere else  reasonably priced beers at 4 for a corona They let you bring your own food in from elsewhere too Only downside is the toilet gets a 110
They put on the World Cup rugby for us no problem Great pub
Put on the rugby world cup for us cold beer and really friendly
Cheap cheerful and plays the premier league Nothing fancy but you get what you want
Small and historic bar Good for a quick coffee and some croissants
Nice staff The best coffee in the area
Good coffee and fabulous croissants

Great Metal bar with wonderfull staff Extensivve selection of drinks and great people to meet even if you cannot speak Italian
Nice small Pub with great Music great people and cheap drinks Loved the visit and met so many great people
Solid metal bar for beers on a Monday night A bit stuffyhot inside but the music was great
If youre over the age of 19 you really shouldnt frequent this place even if it is cheap
nice staff  good food  funny environment
Good
The veggie sandwiches on the menu were a little sad so I tell the waitress that I would give her the ingredients I wanted and she doesnt object My sandwich was with iceberg grilled courgette Emmental mushrooms mozzarella oregano and oil and I tell her I want it big Ill have another one made with a fried egg but different type of bread A bomb Vegetarians go there and have Emanuele prepare your sandwiches Very serious
Last night for the first time my boyfriend and I decided to try this place Really excellent Good quality mixed starter the panels were incredible excellent sandwich and also the boy who followed us the whole time making sure everything was fine is an extra gem See you next time to try the first ones Congratulations
Top
Cozy place excellent sandwiches I recommend it
Old Nash or a job done well If the yardstick of judgment was the experience of the managers alone then it would be 8 stars instead of the expected 5 Infarti rather than old Nash should be called Original Nash in fact this pub and sandwich shop is managed by all former employees of the historic Nashville in Palermo The sandwiches are good the service is friendly and the cocktails are the right ones Despite tradition even the novice customer will be satisfied In conclusion prices in line with the market and if I really have to make a note I would improve the bread a little because there is no limit to quality
Pleasant external environment adequate service but the chicken burger I ate was of poor quality and it was not clear what type it was It had a strange consistency and in the middle of the sandwich which was practically a brioche it was barely noticeable
Top
A fixed stop on our outings now knowing that we will always find it open unlike the other places next door It feels like being at home top environment Delicious food and really good cocktails
very welcoming place top staff although I recommend Fridays and Sundays for the sweet waitress Angela cheerful friendly and always alert but also highly recommended for the music
Not bad food and drinks The venue is also very nice Casual environment Kind service available Honest prices Too bad its in the ZTL but if youre lucky you can park a few hundred meters away Advised
Well selected artisanal beers but change frequently if not daily Dont count on having the same beer you had last time I had the pulled pork but was too salty the bbq needs some work Nice atmosphere with good rock n roll music
Just stopped into the beer shop and meet the owner  absolutely lovely passionate lady with a great knowledge of beer I wish them all the best 
Great selection of beers Very friendly staff Burger not up to beer standards
Great place with great beers and friendly prepared staff Also fantastic food
We all got a mega burger Good but too greasy
Yummy burgers But very expensive Excellent location
One of the worst venues with bad service and quality
Great burger
Tasty sweets and crunchy biscuits  Bread is one of the bread Ive ever tasted Italy wide  Only coffee sold here could be better  improve your coffee and Ill surely turn my marks into a fivestar review 
One of the great pleaces im the city to take a snack lunch or aperitive I can say that i tried almost all the menu they have and its very good done If you search a traditional pezzi or want to take just a coffee with a cornetto or youre a sweet tooth quartararo is the place to go
Good place if you want to grab a quick bite Friendly staff and good service Food was good We had piadinas and they were very tasty Also the gelatto was pretty good
Excellent bakery with huge typical street food selection Must to go for a quick lunch or dinner
Awesome food drinks and extra sweets
Fantastic value for the money good food central nice location no hidden charges for seating use of utensils or breathing  Very friendly service We tried several restaurants in Isola Delle Femmine and this is the very best
Highly recommended Great service and amazing dishes
Petica and her staff are great and friendly  its fun and friendly atmosphere  They have live music in the plaza food n drinks are very good
Good coffee good croissants and rotisserie too courteous staff as soon as it also acts as a pizzeria I will be a loyal customer
Very welcoming place the food is excellent and the staff is extraordinary
Nice place and friendly staff
Good croissants and cappuccino friendly staff 
No food menu They serve only bread Interior looks very classy
It was relaxing easy  going It had many different types of  beer there
Probably the best pub in the city
Non so
Years and years of beers chats parties dinners The place is managed by Cito and his guys A real Pub in its offering and its soul Awarded as the best Guinness Pub in Italy with all the right reasons Sandwiches fried foods meat first courses a vast and high quality choice And then when they can organize evenings and parties again you will be able to see how a solid working group throws up a real party Support your local Pub
Typical place of its category simple furnishings with continuous references to Ireland wooden tables and benches warm informal and welcoming atmosphere You immediately feel at ease We drank an excellent Guinness served properly and at the right temperature Ill be back
Went with a couple of friends during the week Perfect Guinness and friendly Irish pub atmosphere Too bad it opens late 730pm
We have been frequenting this pub for years now tonight we tried the fried foodSTRUPITOUSLY ABUNDANT as usual SUPER SATISFIED
Very quiet beer selection perfect for a nice evening with friends
Its very nice to be
A magical place it seems like going back in time for those who love these suggestions to try A commendation to the owner as my wife says in the end those who are alike we find each other See you soon brother
Nice discovery access to the place is reminiscent of a typical English pub the owner is very kind after having consumed an excellent bottled beer he kindly let me taste the same brewer on tap with a different beer I will definitely come back  thanks for the kindness
Very nice place
Came for breakfast very good coffee but at the price displayed I would have expected a glass of water While as far as the croissant is concerned its not bad its a shame that food must always be taken with gloves or alternatively with tongs
Im just saying that we got three cappuccinos and three empty croissants for the modest sum of 12 euros Poor cleaning
We stopped in for a breakfast Clean and familiar environment the bartender very kind and helpful Good products Great stop Ill be back
Awesome place very cosy and good food
Its a neat place Good to grab some beats and a quick bite The prices are good they are not to high The staff is nice The only thing is during the summer a fan would be nice inside Also they have wifi so that is always a plus for me Their play list is also not what I expected its very mid 2000s I enjoyed it
Food was on point and beer even better The prices are fantastic for the portion size And tho we only spoke English we were able to get what we wanted and enjoy a crisp draft
Actually it looked the part but there was a layer of grime on everything The worst sin was the quality of the Guinness though they either need to replumb the lines or give them a good clean
Top
Amazing vibe
Wide choice of sandwiches with excellent quality products I tasted Lo Zozzo exquisite Possibility of combining delicious and tasty side dishes fried ravioli baked potatoes Wide choice of craft beers absolutely worth trying
Best pub in the neighborhood Great selection of beers Friendly and fast service
They accommodated 2 and a dog and they changed the channel for us to watch a soccer game Good beer and atmosphere Definitely a local hangout spot but even as foreigners we felt very welcomed especially our dog
Great service great food and a wonderful environment Beautiful garden and outdoor area
Great beer selection local to worldwide knowledgeable staff  Good atmosphere good gantry  Simple but good food burgers proper ones and the like
Lorenzo was a great server He spoke fluently in English The recomondations worked well and the food was fresh Would definitely come back
Reheated potatos tart instead of french fries and very small wurst The 1l bear was in reality 08 l and  indeed not an austrian or german restaurantbar as they pretend to be   Ill insert here my answer to your reply because it shocked me the way you called us Your words let me speachless although Ill specify that our question regarding the country origin of the owner came in the context of the mixed therms from your menu where you are using words as bavarez and tirolez for your products and services  in a bavarez barrestaurant which are totally different things and a person originar from one of this places will know that Thats being said this is not an excuse for your poor quality of the products and services I hoped that this was only an misunderstanding that is why we didnt made photographs from the begining but Im sure that your future clients will be convinced of the reality
Really nice place for a calm night out Waitress and cooker are super nice Its not the original menu from Munich but still the sausages are really nice 
It was lovely    highly recommended
There arent many places in Genova to drink beer and watch sports but this place is one of them Good food and service too
My favourite pub in Genoa  with great food and atmosphere Downstairs there is also a tablesoccer and a smoking area  Is great to watch soccer games and have a great time with your friends Very recommended
Best bar in Nervi Great food beers and fantastic service Highly recommended to go for a good night out with friends
If you are in Nervi and you need a great place where to have a pint and dinner for a very reasonable price and without the need of reservation you just found your place
Great burgers and beer Friendly staff totally recommend
Great pub and the owner of course knows his beers  Maybe is not a hidden gem but for me it was Im grateful for my Genovese friend who took me there 
They are amazing Guys brought us focaccia for free  The guys working there are incredible Totally worth it
Great service friendly waitres tasty aperol
Nice prices friendly staff They have a nice soccer table too and also board games
Great place with nice beers and good food to spend few jours with friends
Amazing pub Great beers and generous free snaks
Everywhere better than here They didnt share wifi code they havent a cigarette area menu is just Italian street toilets better than this places toilets Sandwiches are good but hamburgers too bad They have a lot of kind beer so its good but in the result of   quality 18
Friendly pub with very good selection of beers from around Europe
My review is not valid Im biased 


Nice place for beer I will visit next time
Good beer while watching the football game in an elegant bar
Ok
best place in tocwn for real beer lovers 
Such a cool atmosphere Great for aperitivo the snacks were perfect for our drinks and the hostbartender was super nice to us
Great place at Porto Antico to have beer wine or cocktails Good environment and the staff is kind
Great friendly service  superb location and without doubt the BEST burger I have ever had  Without doubt  The bun was soft and fresh  the pattes were delicious  salad and mayo spot but the crispy bacon was immense Topped with fantastic fries Plus  All reasonably priced 
Av Not sure what is considered good here but by me it was average Nice staff cool location and atmosphere but just not that impressed Mayo served with chips tasted funky sorry guys
Really good location with very nice service and good cocktails You should definitely visit it while being in Genova
Lively pub friendly crew behind the bar good selection of beer Whats not to like
The best place for the evening drink with great atmosphere and very friendly barmanthank you for the music Kamila and Marcin
Great bar with friendly staff
Very authentic Local guests only You can spend more time in the bar with your drink reading or observing the life of the Genovese people
You can sit and order something in peace with polite and kind staff
Friendly staff  Just had a quick bite to eat
Very austere but very comfortable
A classic Genovesi bar selling the Genova juice Good people tiny place always busy but stop by to try the local sauce You will be happily surprised 1110
Enjoy the classic corochinotto and focaccia Such a genuine local experience
Authentic old school Italian bar run by a lovely old couple Mostly attended by uni students on Fri and Sat night The only place in town where you should taste Asinello and basil liquor Absolutely a must in your pub crawling bar list
One of the best bars in Genoa cheap and friendly They also give away Asinello posters and calendars
We ate the pasta with salmon  pasta pesto very good  nice service 
Very friendly staff good cocktails and good food for a small price
At first it didnt look fancy but the food turned out to be very very good service had personal touch and selection of alcohol was decent I as a picky eater recommend
I was there 3 Days ago The 2 Guys do the top and are very friendly Greetings from Bern
Cant go wrong with an Irish pub My only wishwant as a foreigner would be to see more live music at this venue That addition would make it absolutely outstanding Either way its worth a visit for a brewski
The place was okay Not very crowded when we came we got a tablet immediately toilet was not dirty but full of writings on the wall Cocktails and other drinks serve in a plastic which is not good qnd not environment friendly
Nice selection of beers Normal pub food not exceptional but not bad The atmosphere is nice and it gets busy later at night I would definitely go back for the beers and atmosphere
Exactly what you wish for in an Irishlike pub Great draughts a nice food menu amicable staff and nice rock music
I always crafting for Guinness and this place offered me the best  Guinness in Bologna  When I visited this place this place was not so crowded and I also could enjoy football match so I think this is the place to chill and spent night  One more thing I really love the oldstyle design of this bar Of course Ill visit this place again
when I drop here at 7pm was a very quiet and quaint place And very delicious especially the beer
Great pub frendly staff very attentive service tasty beer great cheesecold cut board Recommended
Came in during a busy time during f Ball but got served immediately with beers an cider cocktails are best ordered after busy times as the staff are busy but deffinatly worth the wait staff are accomadating and became friends with a few after the crowd cleared 
Surprisingly good Irish pub type watering hole The Guinness was pored competently and correctly and the prices are reasonable
Last time was 10 years ago But its nice to see that its the same Good beers and whisky lovely emploied football and basket in the TV in the center of BOLOGNA Beautifull place to spend a funny evening
Nice staff and venue Huge selection of draught ales Guinness  Kilkenny but a bit out of the way so lacking vibe
Staff very friendly went here first before going for meal
A great pub with great staff and owner very friendly and reasonably priced
Great bar nice beers very friendly staff
I am going there tonight   it will be good Also I will learn Italiano
Top
My partner and I went some time ago for a beer the person at the counter was very kind he let us taste and recommended the beers very good We liked one smoked one in particular very much She was very kind and competent
Highly recommended pub for those looking for a family environment in which to enjoy excellent craft beers Convenient location in the center of Bologna very good cuisine Friendly staff attentive to the guests needs
Pleasant and welcoming place in a central but slightly out of the way location helpful staff the owner recommended excellent beers there are cold dishes but also complete dishes average prices
And then it happens that one evening in October you join friends in the centre but someone who was already there was so impressed by the inauguration of the new pub that it makes you completely rethink the evenings programme Tonight well eat here at the Beltaine Celtic Pub You will understand a new pub in Bologna one of many This is what you might think But no the Beltaine Celtic Pub is not a pub like the others It is a very special pub especially for lovers of the Apennines Oh yes because here there are the flavors of the woods and chestnut trees of our mountains apart from some piadina which so to speak is from Romagna yes but its always there Here you can drink a delicious craft beer that of the Beltaine brewery in Granaglione Even the water comes down from the mountains its her Cerelia water This time the mountain came down to the city not to seek luck but to bring its luck The pork and wild boar sausage are delicious Accompanied by truly delicious and tasty potatoes With tagliatelle then you have the opportunity to taste the mountain style those beautiful portions of substance And to concludea tender dish with exceptional mascarpone Really delicious and delicious Then when you read sausage and beans on the menu you know that you really have to go back to that pub Well done guys I wish you good luck Lets enhance and show our Apennines
What a joke The staff here is so disinterested in their work Over priced drinks with zero service Luckily we did not order food It looked edible yet you could see everyone waiting forever for it And it was not even very busy Go to the Irish Pub 50m up the road
A brilliant night at the Empire  Firstly  the music was top class unlike the Irish pub Clurichanes before it Dead as a door nail Im Irish so I was majorly disappointed  But the Empire saved the day The music had us dancing  We could see there was a Birthday party in the corner  But that was as dead as the Irish pub Then Aldo the Birthday boy saw us dancing and made his way to us and the party started  We were invited in to their private party and we accepted and had a great night Food Champagne and cake followed Also  modestly to us we got the people dancing And a great night was had Have to say the staff were 100 The Empire is thoroughly recommended
amazing place for gathering with friends and watching matches drinks are good and you have a lot of choice you can order something to eat too I really recommend to try burgers staff are friendly and helpful prices are fair you can orders cocktails for 6 or 7 euros
Big pub with many drinking options Service is fine location is good The toilet is absolutely disgusting
Went looking for an IrishEnglish bar to celebrate my birthday  Couldnt find it and wandered across this gem The music caught our interest straight away The Kinks and though it was very humid we went inside  Small but plenty of room Sarah the Spanish waitress greeted us warmly as did the barman Daniel We quickly had two Peronis and I spoke to Daniel about the music It was his playlist and I complimented him on it I asked cos of my birthday  could he play Rory Gallagher He didnt know him but searched and immediately put him on He was so impressed he kept him on for a while Meanwhile  Mary was talking to the clientele  who were very friendly The bar has such a great vibe Cocktails galore were being made and everyone was happy I couldnt have asked for a better place to celebrate my birthday
Lime Bar Bologna is the perfect spot for anyone looking for a night out  The drinks are strong and the music is great Tegroni cocktail recommended  The staff is friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is perfect for a fun night out with friends I highly recommend this place
A cool place for an evening drink Friendly staff  good drinks Sitting outside even alone is interesting you can watch the street passersby There is a chance to chat with others   practice some Italian for example  Grazie per i bei ricordi di Bologna 
Lovely cocktail bar Visited during the day and then returned in the evening for a few more drinks Lovely staff and great atmosphere
I just say they have Augustiner and its well drafted That enough to me to be one of the best three places in Bologna for beer Recommended
old style pub great selection of draft beers friendly vibesin the heart of bologna pratello recommended
Great friendly bar with a real local neighbourhood feel cracking range of beers Warm and friendly during the day really lively and friendly in the evening
The best Aperol Spritz we drunk in Bologna one of the cheapest ones
NOT an English style pub Barn like space with lots of tables and bench seats We arrived 10 minutes after advertised opening time and were clearly getting in the way of the staff having a chat Significantly better places within a short walk and nowhere near worth an expedition out of central Bologna
Nice friendly pub Coming from the USA I had to try a burger   It was OK not great The fries were very good and large selection of drinks
Excellent penne allarrabbiataI like my food spicy and this was the perfect amount of spice for me
There are a lot of amazing pubs in Bologna Old Bridge is the best
Delicious beers and great atmosphere
mmmmmmmmm
Baladin craft beer not bad but not one of my favourites Very slow restaurant service half an hour waited for two canaps with the place not full Luckily they were also good in the end The main room is nice and has something characteristic which the two rear rooms do not have
I expected a little more from a pub on Via San Felice Little assortment of food and beers excessive waiting given that there were no other customers I will definitely go back hoping to see more quantity on the menu
Nice
One of my favorite places
An overnight guarantee
Fantastic venue
Worse than could happen
Bar and pastry shop a stones throw from the symbol of Bologna from which it takes its name name you can drink excellent coffee and taste excellent plated cakes at the counter or sitting down fast service welcoming and bright room
I only got coffee and it felt very Italian Fast tasty and inexpensive Little hidden gem near the citys main landmarks
Lovely little place for a coffee small delicious snacks for breakfast and for an amazing Aperol Spritz Prices are lower than in typical tourist spots the owner is nice and helpful
super friendly staff authentic location good wine and aperol Can recommend it
Drinking here is very pleasant and relaxing Very good tasting cocktails and professional bartenders I recommend that little nice place to everyone
A pub full of locals Nice and friendly staff tasty food great cold beer Easy to get there since its next to a bus stop Give it a try

Enjoyed Argentina vs Australia here
Nice and cosy place Friendly stuf
Wonderful atmosphere Friendly employees Amazing coffee 100 recommend this bar
Its great that this place is open 24 hours The old man owner however is not the most welcoming We had a train to catch at 0440 and hence had to wait here for 23 hours We bought drinks and food a beer every 30 mins and yet he kept on making us feel uncomfortable for waiting there He also spoke no English which made it hard to communicate anything with him even the prices of our drinks With such an odd houred train this place open 24x7 is indeed a blessing albeit the person running it is not
15 for a small beer  02ML And a small cocktail 04ML Never go and drink something here worst bar I have visited in my whole live 
Efficient and pleasant service menu is limited but has something for anyone Prices were reasonable and 24h opening is uncanny Definitely recommended
After a long day in the city we wanted somewhere local to eat and happened on Ein Prosit near the apartment as walking any further was out The first waitressblonde was quite rudehence the service score and didnt smile she must have been at the end of shift as we soon had a different server She wanted our food order at the same time as our drink order but we hadnt even looked at the food menu by then We asked for some olives whilst choosing and this seemed to be beyond her comprehension Eventually a plate of deep fried breadcrumbed stuffed olives arrived which would have been better donated to Ukraine to use in cannons the french fries were ok Our Prosecco arrived lovely chilled and eventually an ice bucket tooit was still 34c We ordered mains and waited a long time however when it arrived it was uninspiring I ordered MeranerTyrolean sausage and my wife ordered the Panna Tortelinni My 2 sausages were nothing other than frankfurterswith a thousand slices and more french frieswith nothing else My wifes pasta in cream was bland tastelessexcept for the cream taste and clumped so probably microwaved Our second waitressbrown hair spectacles was far more friendly and chatty Overall we should have walked a little further to find some decent food
Big selection of beers I told them what I liked and they proposed a good beer for me The food was excellent and the staff friendly Will visit again soon before I leave bologna Definitely worth a visit when you come to this city
Nice dinner The beer is good and the food too The price is the right one because the portions are really big Look at my stinco   I recommend this place for people who like Austrian food and also for those who dont want a fast food when theyre eating late at night
Great place to watch the ATP tennis tour  Tsisipas now Sinner later Not a bad way to pass the afternoon with a prosecco
Great spot for a drink right next to the Asinelli Tower We loved sitting outside to hear the bell from the tower Friendly service Bathroom is available Enjoy July 2022
Very professional stuff good selection of wines And the fever of very famous Italian singer Vasco Rossi
Great location inside antique shopping courtyardvery friendly service Creative Coffee combinationstry the Ginseng Coffeeits great Outside area heatedblankets available and Smoking allowed
This is a convenient spot to grab a quick snack or drink The ac is cool and relaxing and the location is just steps away from the famous leaning towers of Bologna The coffee is good and strong and so is the limoncello enjoy
Old Stove is great example of a classic Irish Pub inviting great vibes food and drinks Came here to watch the Calcio Storico with some friends and had a great time I highly recommend getting the Old stove burger a combination i wasnt sure expecting to be that delicious alongside some well made fries Outdoor seating is also available and i would recommend this spot to anybody
We enjoyed our Beer and Dinner sitting on thier patio Service was great  Would definitely return
Second vist to this little gem of a pub  this time we had food and it was very good  Services is very friendly
Loved it here  While in Florence recently it was the Australian NRL grand final They let my husband stream it on their TV in the bar We had Australians pack the bar which made for an amazing atmosphere and a very memorable day Also their burgers were great
They have a sitting area at the front of the bar and there is a bar in the ground floorentrance area It is a tiny place for a crowded night The place also has an underground area which is slightly bigger We went to a karaoke night but as the place is in underground there wasnt any service and even the wifi connection to the karaoke screen was poor I wouldnt recommend for the people who has claustrophobia
Great service great location but do not order burger meat tasted like rubber Pizza its ok
Karaoke was main draw and I had a blast  As of Sept2023 karaoke schedule is Friday Saturday and Wednesday nights at 1030PM to close  Was able to sing many times with several Italian songs sang by locals which was so fun
Only had the dessert here The nutella mug was clearly cooked in a microwave Definitely not worth the money Friendly staff though
Delicious drinks  and toasted sandwiches Staff and service really good Enjoyed time there
Good atmosphere Service was poor I had full drink dropped on me by waiter The people i was with advocated on my behalf for a free pint which was begrudgingly given Bar men were also quite surly to people that I saw them serving and me Not much cheerfulness Not a real Irish pub imho
Found this beaut at the Piazza del Duomo It was open really late and there was a great vibe Irish favourites like Guinness and Kilkenny Red are available and they even offer some food options Music was great too
The people behind the bar were very friendly and welcoming especially the Jamaican server In addition the drinks were well priced and were very nice Also met some American baddies which made the experience better
The best place to watch Formula 1 if you are traveling through the area Great beer F1 race with a big tv and volume all the way up Love it
We didnt get food here but this was a brilliant pub we found Service was excellent and they were so attentive Definitely worth a visit if this is the kind of place you enjoy
Good pub atmospheresome good stuff on tap cold and thirst quenchingwe had the fish and chips which were good staff friendly and efficienta good place to stop and have a few pints
Decent small pub nothing amazingly outstanding Wouldnt feel like im in Dublin though Toilet isnt the greatest place in the pub 510
We stopped here for a drink only Loved having a beer in an Irish pub in Italy Great experience Menu didnt seem enticing but to have a drink and soak in the atmosphere of this pub with all the memorabilia scattered across the walls was great
absolutely wonderful bar all staff is very friendly and welcoming the woman whom i believe may be the owner or manager is so very sweet i could not be happier with the service and hospitality plus the drinks are reasonable priced we visited every single night here on our trip to florence we will never forget this bar 
This place was a cool little hole in the wall before departing Florence We only had a shot and a drink here but Id imagine itd get busy and be a fun place to go
Young pub with lots of spunk good music and beer Have yet to try the food but got plenty of finger food with our drinks and great service Would definitely recommend if you like small clean pubs with craft brews and cocktails
a classic pregame spot drinks are 6 shots are 3 shot menu is huge and they have a different shot for every college definitely more of a scene for Americans and those studying abroad punch card gives you a free shirt after 20 drinks they also have a food menu that is decent
Nice pub good prices for the cocktails and on wednesday taco night with 2 per taco very good and affordable Also a great choice of draft beer and even draft apple cider
Staff was great very understanding and helpfull and always in a good mood The bar felt very safe with all the security around prices are very good for the location too The ambiance was amazing i would advise this bar for any young tourist or students
Delicious pasta best spinach side dish Ive had in a long time great bottle of Chianti and lovely service Highly recommend
Staff were lovely happily found the football game my husband wanted and put it on a separate TV for him as locals were watching an Italian game We stayed way past the game had drinks and some good pub food It was a Sunday so quiet but a very nice venue would definitely go back 
After visiting the Santa Croce Basilica I was on my way the the Hard Rock Cafe for a late lunch I stumbled on Fitzpatricks Irish Pub and very happy I did  Fitzpatricks is a beautiful pub I spoke a few minutes to who I found out was the owner The pub has not been opened very long but the place is impressive Of course I had a Guinness and ordered a chicken burger  The pub is deceptively large The food was great and the service even better Do yourself a favor and visit Fitzpatricks you will not be disappointed
Really cool decor and ambience i had delicious appetisers here and the staff were friendly great spot for a drink
Genuinely Irish food much of it flown in Great beers Jimmy FitzP will serve you a great pint  or any of the bar staff Lots of rooms in the layout give a feeling of being in a smaller pub even if it can accommodate a lot of people Plenty of TVs sparkling bathrooms central location
Love love love this place Not the cheapest option in Florence but definitely one of the best experiences My favorite deal is the rum and coke pitcher for 10 or the pitcher of Guinness for 13 Connor and Roy are the best bartenders around Super hardworking friendly and fun Great music and great vibes Always a good place to pregame before a night out The balcony is the best part if you can get out there its a beautiful spot to sit and people watch and enjoy the scenery of the duomo I will never forget the great memories Ive made at this spot
As a tourist I was trying out all the different places Stumbled upon this place liked the outdoor set up  On a fine afternoon not a bad place to sip beer with your best friends and who doesnt like burger  Beer was good  food was yummy and so was the service Not sure if I will be visiting Florence again but if I do Ill come back here again
Service was super friendly music was good Guinness pour was solid Im Irish btw
Dont go to vodkas as they will rip you off just ice and water even better Next door to Move on   I did
Perfect nontourists place Old fashioned styled pab with a good beer and wonderful atmosphere Nice and friendly barmen I wish I had been there in the late evening Small glass is 35 and a big one is 6
Great little pub I watched Celtic beat Aberdeen to win the league here in 2019 Nice pint of Guinness Bar staff very friendly Home from Home
One guy helped us get to our hotel which was super nice We stopped by for a drink later and had a couple of beers The atmosphere was great the bartenders we great and the hot dog had no business being as good as it was
I saw this fine pub on the way back to my hotel after a really long afternoon walking the city I decided to come check it out and found a great place to relax talk to some wonderful locals and listen to great music The beer selection is good but the atmosphere is what really hooked me I was very comfortable there Dont hesitate to stop by for good drink and good people
Walked past  noticed the rugby Italy Uruguay match was on tv Really friendly guy behind the bar good at his job Went back the following night to watch France v Namibia bartender welcomed me back and was chatty A good bar great selection of on tap beers Would recommend
This is by far my favourite bar in Florence Its the perfect spot for students watching sports great music and a variety of drink options at an affordable price The bartenders Beckam and Jill are the best So friendly and welcoming every time I go This is a must visit spot for your trip to Florence
Such a great place to hang out and have drinks  The staff is super friendly and pour great cocktails  Live USA sports are on the TV if there so happens to be one on to watch  Watch Celtics  Heat finals  Bring some USs to leave your mark on the wall
Our favorite pub in Italy Spent every spare minute there and really enjoyed meeting people from all over the world Tell Kaitlin and Beckham we said hi
Me and my friends came her a few nights during our trip to Florence and oh my god The bartenders are fantastic and I was not disappointed with a single drink A lovely atmosphere with great music I hope Im able to return some day
We arrived all together as a group of 10 and booked prior we asked to be sat near the ventilator and they stated they could not as a lady was sat where we were meant to be They took our drinks order and forgot two of them I mean if you are not able to remember them there is no shame taking down the orders with a notepad the carbonara was not carbonara more an egg soup with some pancetta even though carbonara requires guanciale the pasta rag was over cooked few of us ordered two courses and it took them more 20 minutes to serve us when we were the only one sat apparently the chicken was tasteless and felt like it had been cooked the day before alongside the potatoes The waiter took her first break after 1 hour the place opened Unprofessional would not recommend The boss was nice but maybe get ahold of your staff
It was ok I guess not very crowded but music too loud for being a small place no entertainment but overall the drinks were good
the atmosphere was good but keep in mind that its small bar for crowded activities or parties
Friends Pub is a great place to stop in and feel welcome  Ruby the bartender was very friendly and great to talk to  Great selection of draft beer and liquor available
Nice pub with different beers cocktails shots etc Prices are a bit high but are on the Florence level 
Best pub in town It just feels authentic is full of local people and a greater vibe all over the place Here you can really meet friends 
Great place to have some beer cocktails or wine during your rushy day at Firenze
Local rock bar Amazing IPA and other beers always nice service  Lora and Freddy make you feel at home Its a must go in Florence
It was fine It was a bit sleezo but theyre open late and they have good bartenders They also let you drink outside until two I have no complaints
Me and my friend walked in to this bar accidently but it was such a great experience This bar is opposite to the other bars in Florence not very touristic The bartenders are very nice and are always open to help you find your way around Florence or to start a conversation The drinks and the atmosphere are great Thank you so much 
Went there on a Thursday night our first night in Firenze and found out a simple cozy really nice bar The barman was super friendly and we really had a great time drinking our cocktails The atmosphere of the bar is really nice and prices are OK Overall really great bar to do in Firenze
After we checked out 4 other Irish Pubs that all seemed disappointing we went back to this one and it was a great choice For us it was the perfect place for relaxing after a day in Firenze Friendly staff incredibly good prices compared to other places and good choice of beer and tasty classic cocktails but also open to cocktail suggestions Would definitely recommend it
Cosimo and Marco are extremely nice and you can see the enthusiasm and passion in the work they do They have a wide variety of beers  cocktails the music is great and so is the atmosphere Love this place and couldnt recommend it enough 
Really great bar with a very good price considering its a 500 year old building owner is an absolute legend as well Highly recommend
Youll agree from the moment you step throught the door Amazing place
Great pub Dexter is a great host  Also happens to pour the best Guinness in Florence and have a bunch of great beers on tap  Definitely check it out
The best pub in Florence Watch a few soccer matches and had a few too many beer there
Pleasant crowd and staff  well priced and just a solid spot overall Thanks for hosting me Came in to watch Liverpool beat Man City 30 for the Champions League QF
Nice place to start your evening around Santa Croce Find the best Guinness outside of Dublin here  which is no exaggeration Their pints are really fresh  smooth And at half the price take that from someone who used to live in Dublin city Friendly clientele and owners Cheers 
Cool place to drop in for a quick beer with a familiar atmosphere basketball on TV and friendly English speaking bartender and American music Bonus nice selection of Whisky
This is just what I need in a pub Great beers and very chill Yasmine is a fantastic bartender and makes you feel welcome even if youre a tourist If and when I get back to Florence Ill definitely be back
Good beer selection good vibes friendly staff saw some locals go to take a drink Recommended if you are a craft beer fan
I didnt know what to choose so I asked for a recommendation from the barista I appreciate the options I was given  The place is not loud at all perfect for casual chill time with friends
Came quite early so plenty of room  ordered Negronis and they are very strong thats great  and margaritas thats also superb  
Im so glad we found this pub during my Erasmus We spend nights in the large room at the back of the bar drinking delicious beers cocktails Thanks Carlo for running this incredible place we will visit you for sure during our next trip to Firenze
Alice is so cool The pub is really nice and the prices are good The vodka lemon is top and the mood is nice and rocky 
Friendly staff low price and nice ambiance Would recommend for drink 
I ordered 3 times my meal to get it 1st irish where no one speak english 
Exellent place to meet friends Very good selection of beersand outstanding service
Good place to eat good pizza at chep pricehave a drink and listen to live music
beer is good food is  un eatable  terrible
Fairly typical Irish bar with Irish beer and food Nice staff who are quite attentive The Guinness and Kilkenny beers are not the best but ok We had Joys chicken  and the fish and chips The fish had a lot of bones but was fresh and tasty the chicken was a large portion and also tasty
Listed as open on Monday Stopped by at 830pm to watch an Irish football match Absolutely closed One other Irish person outside equally confused Try Stuarts Pub instead  its more Irish than this place is
Said it opened at 1730 It didnt When it did open we had a drink each the lager I had wasnt good It was early but no atmosphere at all Not an Irish Pub just a pub full of random memorabilia
We came here to try to watch the world cup quarterfinals game The place was empty except for 2 other people but they told us we could only sit at this side counter They didnt have the volume of the match on it was the pregame before the game started We ordered 2 beers and they were the most expensive beers that we have had in Bari more than any other bar we had been to so far even in old town They were really unfriendly We left and went to Stuarts which is nearby Soooo much better The place was packed the volume was on super friendly bartenders lots of friendly happy regulars Dont go to Joys No Joy there
Both my partner and I have Scottish backgrounds We heard about a Scottish bar in Bari and had to visit it The owner is very knowledgeable about local craft beers from the area and was very friendly giving us some great advice on places to visit in the area We only stopped in for a drink but would recommend the Stuart pub to anyone visiting Bari Weve already recommended the pub to Scottish friends visiting the area Many thanks
We had a greeeaatt eat out at The Stuart Hamburger  was great see picture We took the local one from the menu and complemented it with some fried  cheese The hosts and waitresses are excellent
This bar is great great music doors and drinks and Pietro our server was amazing so friendly and very attentive Food was excellent a very nice relaxing evening spent there
A great bar which served alot of beer ales amd along with great service
We went as a group We ate well and the staff is really friendly and competent Advise
Lets start by describing the staff nice guys available for every request above all quick to serve and make the evening cheerful with their approach to the customer I personally tried the Max hamburger and from my experience I can allow myself to express my opinion on it the flavors marry perfectly with each other Excellent sauces meat cooked as requested and absolutely delicious potatoes And if youre interested the size of the burger is enormous  worthy of the nomination from foodPorn In short what can I say everything was very good and the stay was very pleasant Owner always present and attentive Friendly and very kind Do I recommend it to you Absolutely yes 
I recently visited this place What led me to try it was the unusual but highly appreciated choice of wild boar meat for the burger which I dont remember ever having found elsewhere Really tasty sandwich Ah one thing I cannot fail to mention is the limoncello that was recommended to me In all honesty I dont remember the name but I remember its spicy and particular flavour We all left the table satisfied so I cant help but give a positive rating
Its a place that takes you back in time 1920s furnishings Excellent cuisine and selected beers mean that you can spend wonderful evenings in company Everything is enlivened by a very good selection of spirits to accompany the chefs desserts A really nice experience to try
they provide a very fresh guiness Maybe the prices are slightly high they could go down by 1  other than that  fries are DIVINE
This is a nice pub with great vibe and delicious food I visit it every time I go back to Puglia to visit my family I would definitely recommend it
My work place

Like this place for cocktails even there are other cheaper places nearby Negroni was really good 
Super cool bar with several snack options Smiley personnel and great cocktails make your evenings wonderful
Very nice place with great food and good English speaking service  
Nice spot for a drink with fairly decent service Only 3 stars as there was a cover charge added to the bill and we got nothing for it We  didnt have that  happen elsewhere on our trip to Southern Italy Not even a small snack or olives with the drinks
Fantastic pub Very kind and knowledgeable staff and excellent selection of beers Looking forward to returning any time Im in Bari
Top
Found by chance on maps it offers delicious sandwiches and beers at a fair price Only note I would have preferred more fries with the sandwich given the price
It is a pub where there is a wide variety of quality beers and the staff is very helpful in advising you on your choice describing its characteristics To start with I recommend the caramelized spicy almonds They have a truly particular flavour I wouldnt give up boat fries either For the rest whether its a puccia a piadina or a hamburger the ingredients are all good and you wont be disappointed
Lp atmosphere for aperitivo i went there with my friends and we enjoy our time Unfortunately they dont have fresh juice So healthy people whos nonalcoholic will find a diffeculity to choose a drink but other than that everything is very nice the staff is very kind and the location is in very center of Bari also food is great 
A really cozy place to chill and have fun they have games and the food isnt bad I enjoyed
Typical bar with good vibes Drinks are fairly priced food not sooo much but didnt get a chance to try it Has a large selection of bard games that can be borrowed for 1 euro each Theres a smoking area which is nasty but what can you do
Nice place with good drinks Cocktails cost only 5 eur
Great hamburger and beer selection Fun lively pub
Its always a treat its comfortable and homey I love this place 
Nice and cozy Came for food stayed for the beer
Nice place and good selection of beers
The staff were very friendly and knew English The burgers were of excellent quality and it is very reasonably priced too I would recommend this restaurant
Perfect place to have a beer with friends and a sandwich or hamburgher Gentle personell and quick service
I highly recommend The people are super nice had one of their burgers super super tasty cheap a must As I understood place is always full even during the week so better get there pretty early or reserve You should try their nuts vodka best Ive ever had 
We are so happy we came here We had read reviews and decided we had to check this place out it did not disappoint The atmosphere was relaxed and casual they have a great beer list There menu was excellent we had 3 types of shareable apps which were simple but had great flavor The staff is excellent they were very nice and had fun attitudes We all tried different burgers which all had unique flavors I highly recommend this place if you are in bari Make sure you make a reservation it is a busy stop
If youre there during summer time be prepared to wait a few minutes However the staff is very professional Theyll write your name down and call you when your table is ready You can sip on some delicious cocktails while enjoying a mesmerising view of Bari
A nice place for a seaview and chilling Dont choose Mango Tango if you are not a big fan of spicy taste
Really kind staff good cocktails Definitely worth the price
cute drinks place try coffee shakerato with baileys so nice and refreshing
A very good place by the boardwalk Dogs are welcome and making the place so much more friendly The food is amazing I Had  the best chicken and potatoes of my life My husband enjoyed pasta Al dente with shrimp in pistachio sauce We travelled the world and live in New York and are very hard to please Best yet below pasta dish is only 10euro
Very nice restaurant near Taksim Square Excellent food  staff and waiters are very polite kind and professional I went there many times also for take away service Highly recommended
Very pleasant bar near the old town with very nice staff and great drinks
The atmosphere is absolutely cozy with nice old fashion design and intimate lighting And the staff are lovely and can help you chose the right drink The price is very reasonable too If I lived in Bari and was not here on a visit I would definitely return regularly Thank you for a lovely evening we will be back soon
Good coffee fair prices and kind owner and super fantastic girl he lent me an umbrella there was a heavy downpour to get to get the car
Two san bitters in a natural way to disgust 5 Watch out for all the FAKE reviews trust me there is better in Modugno
Pleasant place efficient courteous and helpful staff Possibility of being able to sit inside well refreshed or outside in their gazebo Excellent place I recommend it for an aperitif meetings etc
The cedrata was served to me without draft and with ice in the glass unprofessional
Good food and great staff
Nice food very friendly staff Highly recommend it
Very nice place where you can enjoy excellent beer and delicious sandwiches Friendly staff The only negative note is that not all liquors are available
Nice experience very welcoming and tastefully furnished place  Excellent service quick attentive and above all friendly and polite staff  High quality of ingredients  The bread made by them is very good and lactose free The only suggestion would be to include lactosefree dairy products because it seemed to me that every combination includes fresh cheeses or dairy products  Wide choice of good quality beers Also available nonalcoholic beer and craft drinks  Oh I almost forgot the sweet potatoes  Yummy  Ample possibility of finding parking  Bathroom spotless and equipped with everything
Beautiful place good vibes cool people
Nice place to stay with friends and have some drinks
Good place and live music
Who
We were there yesterday 19022020 and it was wrong decision Food portions were small cold and we were waiting so long We felt like those products were bought immediately after our order was placed We have paid a lot of money but we went out hungry The chef is pleasant only on the beginning then they disappear and heshe dont care What is more we were obligated to pay 1 for each person for the service It was a nightmare i dont recommend
Taste of the pizza was ok its propably better for drinks
Tasty food but nothing special compared to the other meals eaten whilst in Italy One of the few restaurants that remains open through the siesta shutdown
Fresh high quality food excellent wine great service family atmosphere very good prices 
Very cute and quaint place Quality dishes and a highly soughtafter menu that conforms to the world of pirates both in terms of taste and aesthetics Also a wide choice of drinks delicious sandwiches as well as dessert and all at very honest prices Super nice staff and everything very good and beautiful Very approved
Beautiful pub like few others with a pirate setting to immerse yourself in starting from the counter which resembles the stern of a galleon Refined and quality dishes Beers for all tastes the staff knows how to best advise you For the warm months there is a lounge in the outdoor garden relaxation guaranteed
I had a very good time Very nice and quite themed environment Excellent food fast service and very friendly waiters Im sorry that it was very empty and thats why Im leaving this review hoping that more people will come
Great food great beer and great staff In addition to being particularly unique in its kind the restaurant transmits pleasant sensations I highly recommend

A more than decent pub in Triggiano Satisfactory quality of sandwiches really not bad Prices overall average not exactly low but not very high either For example I got an 8 euro sandwich with hamburger sausage and ventricina inside really huge which filled me up quite a bit and I paid 8 euros for it The Bud beer is also good which I dont find very often around and the fact that you dont have to pay a cover charge is also good However be aware that excluding the sandwiches on the right side of the menu the special and more expensive ones cutlery costs an extra 10 cents Single bathroom for everyone but very clean The place is also themed In short to be recommended The real flaw was that despite the halfempty room I had to wait a long time before having the sandwich
Quality food including glutenfree and vegan Possibility to compose the sandwiches as you like The only flaw is a single totem for ordering and the lack of possibility to also choose the fish version
Tasty sandwiches affordable prices The plain hamburger doesnt have much taste while the 300 gram one has a strong flavour As far as frying is concerned the speck and potato triangles are very good while the fries are not just the best since you hear that they are fried in the same oil as the crab claws so they absorb their taste Recommended for a burger night The only downside is that you have to arrive early as the place is small and there are not many seats
Having lived in Catania for a year this is my number one place having pretty much been everywhere and let me tell you about something service is excellent drinks well prepared and tasty My favorite thing is that their Chili Con Carne is the best Ive ever had in Europe and Ive been all over that continent If you are in Catania then you must visit Mr Hyde Their interior is also amazing From an old English pharmacy and I dont believe its props but actually real
Super cool oldpharmacy style bar very friendly staffs we came here for lunch dishes are cheap and nice The waiter offered us an extra tiramisu for valentines day It was one of the most romantic afternoon i ever had
Good beer and friendly staff who somehow put up with the theme pub look and music playing Im always amused by these mock pubs they are designed to look feel and sound like an IrishBritish pub but never look like anything in the UK Still nice place loved the Messina beer and happily hid here while it rained
Drinks were okay lasagne was goodand friendly lady behind the barowner was so kind
Great pub with a stylish interior and fresh British beer in Sicily love it
The best british pub Ive ever been to Friendly staff sooooo many cool details Grrat guests We loved it here
We stopped in for a glass We chose a variety the bartender immediately took the largest glass and simply ignored my request to pour a smaller one The result is 8 euros for tasteless beer Dont recommend
The place is very nice and many locals are here the bartenders are very nice and the atmosphere is great I recommend this place for a few drinks as they make good gin tonic
Great prices Baco for 5 only and you can choose an additional shot for free Free chips Friendly staff
Really good and cheap drinksPolecam
Very nice
Pub located in a strategic point in the historic center of the city near the Massimo Bellini theatre Nice staff Great cocktails Without draft beer but in exchange different varieties of bottled beers Modest prices A good place to be able to drink quietly and well
Never ate here but the staff are WONDERFUL Especially Grazie  We got stuck on the Godfather and the Godmother cocktailsjust do it We first came here with friends but each time we came after we were treated like old friends Love it
We tried the tagliera Various cheeses and meat if you wish with bread sundried tomatoes and olives Ideal when you dont want a big meal
The price is good in relation to the ambiance and quality of drinks I prefer to go to this place than others aroujd the area because of the variety that is quite cheaper among the competitors as well as good amount
Best handmade Amaretto Sour Ive ever had Went there for a nightcap every day of the trip Outdoor seating under some lovely twinkling lights High end bottles behind the bar Surprised how nice it was due to the name was prepared for the worst
Great place sober relaxing often crowded yet in an excellent shape Offers a huge variety of beers the owner is polite and friendly Food is excellent and the prices just as good Weekly offers different events usually live music but happened to have chess events and much more
Great food and a friendlywelcoming atmosphere
bad service
Unexpected By chance I found myself entering this pub steeped in history A private and pleasant place with excellent quality dishes and above all the satisfaction of being able to choose rare beers with a unique taste Veteran owner in the field extremely nice person and great host Thank you so much for the hospitality and pleasure it created such an amazing evening 
The bar no longer exists since 30 01 2021 Closed due to retirement
Place to visit
It sucks
Great irises 
Experienced lovely staff All draft beers are local or not popular international ones
A cozY bar in the center of catania nica cocktails relaxed atmosphere Looks like an old house inside
Good beer bad service Service only comes every 20 minutes Would not do again even though the beer is excellent
This is such a wonderful place We went to Gotham two days in a row to grab some drinks and olives Highly recommended The owner is also a cool guy whos up for a chat
Just discovered this pub in San Giovanni la Punta welcoming and relaxing environment excellent prosecco and good food we will definitely be back to try other things on the menu and drink some of the beers on their menu
Pub that changed location and reopened this week 8 of us went for an afterdinner beer wide choice of beers and drinks perhaps a few more nonalcoholic cocktails could be useful to someone Cozy place well themed you feel at home There are board games and cards to accompany the evening with friends  The only piece of advice I can give to the owner is to try to advertise as much as possible many dont know that you have reopened it would be nice to see it full on Saturday evenings and weekdays  In the social media era its much simpler
Very characteristic and welcoming pub with a warm atmosphere located in the center of the municipality of San Giovanni la Punta CT Excellent beers and spirits with lots of choice available The dishes on the menu are also of excellent quality On certain evenings it is possible to listen to good live music while dining or drinking with friends
Cozy place that hosts jazz themed evenings in line with the atmosphere of the place Good selection of beers suitable for every need and food that goes well with drinks Peculiar feature of the darts inside the salon
Seriously who wrote all those reviews Cocktails were cheap alcohol tasted so bad One of the worst cocktails i ever had Barkeeper was a cute old man though maybe thats the reason nobody wants to be honest with what the Cocktails really taste like
It wasnt open just after two while Google states 0330h
Stayed in Catania for a few days by far the best pub we found highly recommend
Nice place Very good and tasty drinks
delicious coctails for only 35 euro
Cocktails 35

Perfect drinka very nice Staff I recommend 100
Very good cocktail and good beer I only give 2 stars because  when ordering we are warned that cocktails are 7 instead of 5 as indicated on the menu and beers are 6 instead of 4 Because we are tourists  finally the cocktail is billed at 8 Damage
Great place quiet and with very courteous staff Good choice of beers Super recommended  very fair prices 
I liked it a lot Well served cocktails service minded personable and knowledgeable Great staff I will definitely be back
Its my favorite pub One of the very few pubs where the cocktails are made with skill
Delicious drinks super staff great live music


Lovely place umbrellas creates amazing mood Food was super tasty service at high level with willinges to help Aperol approved by my demding wife I really like proposed by waiter sicilian wine For sure its  must visit spot in Catania
Great atmosphere Service was absolutely terrible and two of the wait staff couldnt care less The food was good and I would go back just for the vibe but I would choose a different restaurant
Superb place such a great vibe and staff are really friendly   a great team Kept coming coming back here for post evening meal drinks The umbrellas are also amazing
Good food nice staff great atmosphere and location near the fish market Food was OK but the fries were a bit on the salty side
The best Place about wine drinks and food open until late i tried the IPA beer  was Amazingsee u soon
Great Moscow mule Very good gin tonic Very friendly and attentive bar keeper Nice place Incredible price performance ratio
Friendly staff good cocktails
This place was a great surprise Hidden in a common street in the city center Diapason received 20 of us twice during our weekend getaway with tremendous professionalism and joy A special shotout to the barman for the best Moscow Mule in town
This  place has great food and live band very great astomphere for outing 
We had a dinner here for celebrating a birthday party All the dishes were greasy and unhealthy Absolutely do not ask for pretzels and peanuts Next times I will come here I will ask only for french fries which are probably the lesser evil Beers are nothing special The strenght of this pub is its location and bands who play live music in the weekend Long wait to sit
Its okay but nothing special the service was so  so considering that we came as ones of the first customers it was hard to get anybody to come over
Pretty good place Popular with all ages and great live music Good for a dine a lone occasion or roudy group get together
Friendly welcoming staff and locals great to find a dog friendly pub that appreciates the dogs as much as the humans
Great atmosphere full with people laughing and singing to the jukebox on a Sunday morning 
A Lovely Pub With Weekend Club On The First Floor Defo Enjoy The Drinks And The Company Along With The Weekend Music Played By DJ STEVE PERRY Always Feel Like Having A Good Time With Ones Beloved Friends And Family Members
Popped in Saturday afternoon full of neanderthals who obviously hadnt seen a woman for a while Tried to make us feel intimidated and uneasy Left prior to my other half being clubbed and dragged away to a cave 
Cameron is without doubt the best barman James did alright considering it was his first day From Mark Dyer
Such a nice bar It was fairly quiet when we visited We were met by an extremely friendly member of staff who allowed us to taste some local beer before we bought Although we didnt eat others did and the meals looked delicious  The interior is very tasteful and atmospheric  Well definitely come again
Isle man great place to visit
Bacon cheese burger Burger was lovely bun was dry Chips were good
A friendly pub with a mixture of locals and tourists and prices matching weatherspoons in the uk and Ireland great entertainment the only negative is that you have to pay 1 to enter at all times I can understand for when there is entertainment on BUT not during the day when nothing is on that is why I gave it 4 out of 5
A quid in then cheap booze for the nightyoull need a lot of energy   as its vibrant and fun not for the faint heartedkicking at nightmanager and staff  run a great pub
Just back from short break in Douglas iom and found this bar on our second night You pay 1 admission then once inside drink is cheaper than anywhere else wed been  Staff were really friendly and made us feel very welcome The entertainment was fantastic too needless ti say we went back the next night for more  Would definitely recommend
Always a good night in the Quids My mates and I come over for the TT and always visit here for the great atmosphere drink prices and entertainment I found myself back on the island a few weeks after the TT for a short break on my own and its a welcoming place to go into alone With friendly bar staff and customers 1010
It isnt that the food was bad It was indeed tasty Its more that the majority of choices are over all not exactly healthy In that area its rather limited If you like fried foods Pasta burgers n fries etc Then youll love it here If your a diabetic maybe not so much The atmosphere has changed They are really doing alot to remodel and inside is looking very nice The waitresses were all very friendly and on it
We were a family of 4 adults on holiday to the island we all agreed that we had all enjoyed our meals We arrived just as they were finishing cooking for the lunchtime but they were very kind and catered for us The meal was of a good size and felt it was value for money If I was to visit the island again I would return to this pub for another meal
Friendly staff We had an issue as we had been given the wrong information about food started at 5 pm on a Monday So we had been there since 4 waiting for food and having a few drinks Unfortunately no food was being served I spoke to Jack the manager and he was so apologetic of his staff giving us the wrong information They did the decent thing paid for our taxi to a restaurant and paid for out last round of drinks  Menu looked good just check that food is being served Yes would go back  Location good as trams go past and on the sea front
Went here our first night in the Isle Of Man it is near the end of the promenade with plenty of parking outside Starters are around 7 the southern fried chicken strips were nice with sweet chilli dip but quite salty They have pie of the day which was steak and ale the meat was nice and soft the hand cut chips a bit to much on the chunky side though The arrabbiata I had with chicken which was 1295 and very nice I would have liked some pepper on it but the pepper was empty and the waitress was no where to be seen The bottle of Shiraz was perfect and the indie music in the background was very much to my liking All in all a good place to go and worth checking out
Old style Pub friendly staff and costumers  good local beers not expensive only thing what lets the place down is the toilets are terrible
Mainly went for the food and drink and wasnt disappointed If youre looking for a nice inexpensive meal and a friendly atmosphere then a Monday night might be your answer at the Rovers
Good ales and still Cider Beautiful warm 
Didnt eat there but good range of local beers friendly service  genuine atmosphere The legendary loos still wiff but perfectly clean Not to be missed
Great location for a drink before going to the GaietyVilla Marina Unfortunately they had run out of Bitter and Red Wine The floor could do with a good clean as your feet stuck to it as you walked
A good pub very busy and lots of entertainment this is a great place to meet your friends with this hot weather we have been having they serve in plastic glasses so you can take them outside
This pub is in Douglas town centre Staff customer service skills were very good I will be visiting this pub when I go back to IOM in the future
Nice pub but really busybasically because its good Good beer good service  pretty decent bands
Great food  great value friendly helpful staff  highly recommend
My wife and I visited the British Hotel whilst on holiday on the Isle of Man in June 2023 The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming  so much so that we returned twice more during our stay The menu is very good with vegan and vegetarian options and plenty of pub classics The Specials board is always worth a look as well There is a broad selection of beers available including some from the local breweries I have no hesitation in heartily recommending the British Hotel to anyone visiting Douglas
Weeks holiday staying close by and after first visit  returned twice more Called in early to book and wonderful staff suggested nice corner table  I had sole amazingly cooked and much less than the local restaurants Took a photo to show family at home it was that tasty  Hubby had pub made pie and fish and chips All lovely   Had a great chat with a local couple enjoying dinner there The staff were always patient and smiling no matter how busy they got This is a hidden gem
The go to establishment on the island Let the magic flow the staff are awesome and very attentive to your needs Great selection of drinks As for the food we are impressed having the fish and chips I normally do not eat the batter I must say its on the best of all time fish and chips one has eaten You can see the venue is very welcoming and the atmosphere flows through the premises Thank you for the experience
On the last day of my visit to Reykjavik I went for a slow walk through the city streets I walked free entering the next shops with souvenirs local food and sweaters At some point I was stopped by a terrible sound coming from a broken loudspeaker in one of the main streets of the capital The cacophony was so awful that I quickly concluded  this must be karaoke And someone is trying their strength before the performance in Got Talent   I entered the place out of curiosity Inside I saw a bar with a waitress serving drinks and meals There were maybe 15 people seated at a dozen of tables In the corner sat a man with a guitar who as it turned out was playing local songs in Icelandic and wellknown pieces of country rock and some pop in English A broken loudspeaker on the street is just a cover thanks to which only the chosen ones will be able to experience a few atmospheric moments with a beer and great live music  Guests were divided into local residents who sang stamped and beat the rhythm together with the guitar and tourists who did not understand a word but simply absorbed the spectacle and rhythmically stamped their feet smiling from ear to ear I have absolutely no knowledge of Icelandic music but it sounded like a combination of shanties and country music The singing of the waitress raising a toast with the characteristic skl and the sound of the guitar and harmonica will stay with me as long as the views of the most beautiful waterfalls and volcanoes  Theres a good chance that i was the only one  who expierienced the show of his life People came in and out without staying as long as I did Tastes are not discussed so I will say one thing  it was a great spectacle for me thank you for every song I recommend this place to anyone who likes to contemplate with good music on
Charming bar in city center The owner is SO kind and if you ask what kind of beer is best he will very graciously share all of his knowledge of what he keeps in stock and his opinions of he thinks youll like best I love learning about local beers so this was an amazing stop
Location that Google Maps shows appears to be incorrect
Very friendly staff and good vibe Great place for a shot of Flokki as well as knowledgeable bar man with history of Icelandic whiskey
Great selection of Icelandic craft beers Servers behind the bar are super friendly and have a good knowledge of these beers If you like porters I highly recommend the Red Hot Chili Porter its not really spicy just great flavour They dont serve food but you can go to the Icelandic Street Food a couple doors down and allowed to bring it in So you can have some good soup in a bread bowl along with your cold beer
Very welcoming atmosphere staff are incredibly helpful and friendly Lots of amazing beers to try and can even play board games here too Would love to go back and visit again
Fantastic bar very friendly and a great choice of Icelandic beer what more can you want when you come to Reykjavik Great cafe next door owned by the bar offering lovely homemade food Really made our visit even more special thank you
Great atmosphere barman is super kind and beers are just great Im on my 5th one and loved all of them Its nice to sit in front of the big window to look outside while you have a drink You can also grab Icelandic food on their restaurant next door
When arriving at the hotel we found out they had decided to overbook us and forced a few of use to room in less than ideal one person rooms for a week My room faced the water which a nice view but my window had no seals resulting in hearing the wind every night Overall during my months stay I did not see the change in bed linen and the only thing the hotel staff did was change towels  trash I would have gone and slept in a tent if it was an option over this
Overall a good stay near the airport  Late check in was no problem  Staff was very nice  Its good to know that there are stairs and no elevator  Alas they disregarded the booking for an ocean view room for which I paid extra points and put me on the street side  I would have been find with that except that there was a bar across the street that was incredibly loud even at 3am  People were smoking outside with much shouting  Room was very hot heat turned on and so I needed the door open to cool it down  Even with door closed still so much noise  I was there on a Friday night so maybe better on a weekend  Its strangely spare in design no hooks for towels for example  It just wasnt as user friendly a space as I stayed elsewhere in Iceland
The staff here was so gracious when they were suddenly inundated with stranded airline passengers Rooms are basic but clean Quiet and a good nights sleep Solid breakfast and plenty of coffee I took them up on the recommendation for the community pool having been to the blue lagoon and didnt want to pay for that again  It was a great way to spend my bonus day in Iceland
Perfect location in proximity to the hotel with many restaurants close by  The staff is very friendly and courteous and they offer a shuttle to the airport  Great place to stay for your first or last night in Iceland  We got stuck due to our flight being canceled and they were able to accommodate us for another night  Highly recommend this hotel
So Irish feels like home nice drinks live music very nice place and the Irish barman is a lovely guy 
One of the most beautiful Irish pubs Ive been to
A great tap comes a great responsibility and also a great stream of water without touching it Some people call it magic like the result of a Boli beer happy our but I call it Socorro Bles bles
Great Happy hour beer under 1000 kr which is the cheapest i found plus happy hour was until 8pm really good shots reasonably priced Bar tender was nice and recommended our next place on our bar hop
Would recommend a visit We found the pub to be quite busy but it was happy hour The staff were friendly The drink was good  the sports stations a bonus
Long happy hours good music and happening evenings Its a pub in the best way
Im surprised the Dubliner in Reykjavk isnt rated higher We found the security and the bar staff to be all friendly Moreover in terms of the interior its a pretty good attempt at replicating what bars are typically like in Ireland Probably the only issue to mention is how the footpath outside the pub isnt properly cleared of snow unlike some of the other bars in downtown Reykjavk making it a bit awkward to enter the bar Other than that the Dubliner in Reykjavk is a good bar charging fair prices for Iceland
A great bar with great bar tenders They are so nice and down to earth like an old school bar About 6 beers on the tap This is in march 2023 I tried the blanc loved it Local beers happy hour till 9pm
A beer is 1500 You can do better Keep walking I didnt try the food Service was good For 3000 you can spin a wheel and possibly win up to a meter of beer Atmosphere at around 19302030 was quiet enough to enjoy a good chat at the tables Service from the bar was quick and easy
What a bar We go back every time were in Reykjavk Really good vibe the live musics always fantastic Definitely on the louder side so dont expect a quiet drink out Darts are fun and everyone gets involved The wheel is the star of the show Spin wheel behind the bar which you can pay for a spin on and win up to 8 drinks or shots Really good fun and gets the whole bar cheering
What a fun place Its an environment where you just relax have fun enjoy the atmosphere and music to have pints and cocktails We left smiling We had Guinness and a few local beers Highly recommend this place if youre okay with louder lively customers  The drink wheel was constantly spinning This was a true highlight when it comes to the Iceland pubs
To be fair I went in just after it opened and I was the only person here  The place was clean and cosy with background music  I wouldnt say its like a typical English pub but its not a bad imitation  The bar staff were quick and efficient and I felt chilled out and relaxed as I rested between shops while I was on a souvenir and gift finding mission around Reykjavik  It would be a completely different atmosphere later in the day I am sure
Nice bar with often live music
Good atmosphere Good place to play Bingo and get some drinks with friends
Nice enjoyable bar The locals made my wife and I feel at home Definitely get the cheese sticks while here
Really friendly bartender Went on a Monday night just before closing and they were accommodating even when we couldnt decide what we wanted
Yum Yum and Yum We were craving some red meat and came across the American bar We ordered the lunch special of a cheeseburger chicken wings in bbq sauce and chips The portions were large great because we were starving and atmosphere was relaxed It was so good that we went back for dinner One of the more reasonably priced meals in Reykjavik city centre
We had a quick lunch after the lava show Speedy service and the staff was super friendly  My chicken salad was so tasty and we finished our drinks in the outdoor sitting area where we could soak up the sunlight
45 overall We watched the NFL games here with 100 other fans Overall we had a great time
Very disappointing  this is nothing like an American bar The ambience was definitely a sports bar feel but the food was awful  the worst bar food you can imagine The drinks were fine  typical for anything youd order at a dive bar Our server was friendly but overall the service was incredibly slow and our food did not come out accuratelyexactly as ordered There are so many other better places in the area to eatdrink so definitely do no recommend dining at this place
Came for dinner and loved it here Burgers and fries were both really good My husband and I talked about this meal for a few days after we ate it  They also have a full menu of different flavored White Russians which I highly recommend We got 2 regulars and 1 banana Russian and they were all delicious
Super touristy bar but damn is it good The atmosphere is really the best part its super cool Its obviously based off the movie Big Lebowski but is more than that The staff was really nice and fun to talk to The drinks they made was also super good Big fan
Cant say enough good things about the Lebowski Bar Admittedly its one of my favorite movies and the bar does a great job of paying homage to the movie Its a burger bar so dont expect a huge variety of different foods but they do have a ton of burger choices The milkshakes are great but pricey at over 10 USD The burgers are messy and quite good while not being overpriced for the area The bar has a movie going in all rooms as well and its just a fun bar to eat while looking at Big Lebowski items If we had more time at the end of our trip we would have gone back and Ill definitely go again when we get back to Iceland
Rated 5 stars but would give 6 if could One of the best themed bars ever Got a White Russian with my special lady friend and really dug the vibe I think the rug really ties the bar together and there is a lot of details to the movie all around the establishment Great staff
Loved this bar The blues night did not disappoint The local band had three guest artists that joined throughout the night Awesome atmosphere and I would recommend you bring some cash to go in the hat when passed around for the band This bar builds great memories
Iceland in general is not a country fueled by whiskey  Dillons was a bright spot for our traveling whiskey hounds The music and atmosphere were merely the rocks and a bigger glass  We were able to visit twice both times did not disappoint  Locals and tourists were packed into the attic performance space to hear really good local blues performances that catered to everyone  For those who dont drink whiskey theres a wide selection of Icelandic beer worth sampling for those who do they have a wide selection of Floki mixed in with a whole wall of the golden ambrosia  We will definitely return to see the outdoor beer garden in action and hear fake chicken played again
Nice bar in Reykjavik We came thinking we could order some food but the basement where they serve the food was closed The music is good the staff are nice I would recommend this place to whoever wants to go to a pub without a plan
Amazing bar in the heart of the city centre It was only 10 minutes walking distance from my air BnB Great drinks The staff were friendly and talkative The bar has live music and karaoke nights
Warm and cozy atmosphere and really friendly staff I had the chance to try some exquisite palette the grilled whale fin and reindeer meat burger both tasted amazing The waffle fries were a fun touch and enjoyed the Viking beer as well Overall great food that does not burn a hole in your wallet restaurants can be very expensive in Iceland totally recommend
Great food great atmosphere well worth a visit We have been three times during our trip Tried a number of different dishes and all were yummy They treated my missus very kindly on her birthday meal Very happy
Theres always a line BUT it is 100 worth it Fermented Shark its a nice experience and the Main Courses are unbelievable good  Sheep Head and Fin Whale Steak are delicious beyond belief Desserts are a great and they also have a diverse selection of Icelandic beers and spirits  Would highly recommend 1010
Amazing food great drinks and really nice wait staff Icelandic meat soup was even better than I heard it would be Definitely understand the ratings for this place Tried the cod and chips meat soup surf and turf burger and we loved them all Smoked stout was also surprisingly yummy
Very dangerous placeMy brother almost got killed therenobody called the policePlease dont go there if you want be safe
Jackpot by some Iceland Lady Congratulation 
Good for a late night drink when everything else is closed Greenlanders cause trouble there getting too drunk and fighting
guys fighting coughing their lungs out at the bar  a fun experience but maybe stay just for the one drink and then move on 
Loved this place for a quick drink will come back for their great happy hour No food just great drinks and staff Loved their selection of draft beers and spirits  so many choices for gin and tonic Music nightly come for happy hour and stay for hours
Great bar in Reykjavik Spent part of our New Years Eve here and had great time Friendly staff and a homey local feel for a pair of travellers Great spot for live music too Vist Den Danske Kro when you visit Iceland
Id go as far as saying the Den Danske Kro is  the best bar in Reykjavik its open late the live music is excellent and the drink prices are very reasonable
Cute little pub Was open until 1am with a live artist Nice atmosphere and plenty of drink options Darts board is a great addition
Iceland is not a cocktail place  the cocktails in Iceland pale in contrast to the friendliness and kindness of the people and ten times out of ten your experience is improved by the wonderful character of the people  Sadly Vedur offers the exact opposite The cocktails are excellent well considered exceptionally executed and a treat to drink However the experience is marred by the condescension and attitude of the staff The cocktails were fantastic but I would not return for another
Very cozy and chill place great for cocktails We stayed here on our first day in Iceland Liked it
My boyfriend and I are from craft cocktail land in Northwest America When I tell you that the bartender made the best Brenniven cocktail Ive ever tasted along with a double shot gin that tasted like a freaking green smoothie she knows her stuff We loved the atmosphere and the service We both said we wish we could introduce the bartender to our favorite bartender back home Sincerelyhighlight of our trip and hope to return in the future
I was there with friends drinking Great beer and cider LGBT friendly it looks small from the outside but it actually has a basement floor which is huge
Great place for brunch Fun atmosphere nice servers and food came quickly The blueberry pancakes were delicious as well as the much talked about Dirty Bruch We also grabbed some Bloody Mary drinks which were perfectly spicy Overall a great choice close to the hotel
This is a nice restaurant surprisingly an actual laundry mart in basement The restaurant has some colorful gorgeous interior  I really liked their cheeseburger Its large has lots of ingredients including two types of cheese But I found fries fish n chips chips and guacamole to be pretty average dishes None of tasted as good quality as the burgers
Went for brunch This location has a literal Laundromat in their basement and a kids play area as well You order on their website and they bring you your food with haste Got their dirty brunch and its a bunch of food Very filling if youre looking for a good bang for your buck
Went for breakfast and the next day for lunch Fresh  delicious We ordered avocado toast everything was cooked properly not sloppy  blueberry pancakes out of this world Delicious dirty chai Kitschy  colorful decor Its a must
Would not call it an Irish bar but I would call it a decent bar Good service and drinks at very reasonable  prices Good large screen telly which had a few Aussies in watching Australian rugby league Would definitely recommend a visit to Longford You can sit inside or if you prefer there are a number of tables and seats outside near the entrance
Its a decent looking pub a fair pint food is good servise could be better sometimes Last time we were here a guy that was working there ignored us after our first pint Didnt get the second round we ordered so after 20 minutes we left The night before waiters did their job so I believe this was just a small glitch Fair prices worth the visit
DO NOT ENTER  OF ZERO STARS we arrive at this place where the welcome is zero having said that we order two beer menus other beers in the center and three cicchetti the waitress with a look like why did you come here to drink takes the order and whatever we didnt wait long also because there were 5 of us plus another table of two meanwhile the waiters were huffing and puffing as if there was no end we paid a service 3000 huf to only make us look bad Tipping here in Hungary should not be mandatory but optional I would not have tipped these two waiters I hope they are not the owners because they dont do their job properly in Italy the service is better than here generally speaking throughout Hungary as I had already read in other reviews maybe its because we are Italian never again I advise against it to everyone DO NOT ENTER HERE
Snakebite is a great drink for those who dont like the usual beer taste and want something sweet and refreshing
More Phoney Dublin than Publin  I came here because of the reviews citing the friendly customer service and good Guinness  The Guinness was served far too quickly and not a hint of a smile or any banter despite the emptiness of the pub  As an Irishman Ive been in a few pubs and drank more than my share of Guinness  Not only was this pint rushed but from the taste I could tell the pipes havent been cleaned in a while  If youre seeking the real deal you wont find it here  I wanted to like it but sadly it feels more like a rundown English pub than a taste of home
A nice spot and had a set up for watching sports inside or outside Lively with the crowd Drink prices were pretty decent in comparison to another Irish bar in the area  Didnt feel particularly Irish other than serving Guinness etc  Service wasnt great though It was incredibly busy so take into consideration but there were four bartenders behind the bar yet only one seemed competent The others were in no rush to serve and though they could see people waiting went about other duties
I visited Publin Irish Pub  Restaurant and had a great time The pub has a cozy and authentic atmosphere with wooden furniture Irish memorabilia and live music The staff was friendly and attentive and the service was fast I enjoyed some good Irish beer from their wide selection of drinks They have several draught beers on tap such as Guinness Peroni and Kilkenny I especially liked the Guinness Draught which was smooth and creamy The prices were reasonable for the quality and quantity of drinks The pub also has some nice features that make it stand out from other places It has an upper desk where you can enjoy the loud music while sipping your drink It has neat bathrooms that are clean and wellmaintained It has outdoor seating where you can relax in the fresh air also it is located in a prime location and thus easily accessible which is close to many attractions shops and public transport I would recommend this pub to anyone looking for a fun and relaxing place to hang out in Budapest
Place for drinkers Small but lots of selection Most importantly very close to my hotel
Guinness and service was good But a ton of fruit flies were really bothering me all around at the table and one even wanted a taste of the beer while I was drinking it Granted i didnt drink a pint of beer in 5 minutes but still at a reasonable pace Fruit flies in the toilet as well I have never encountered fruit flies in a pub before What happened
This is a proper Irish bar in the heart of Budapest Great service and a really good pint of Guinness and packs of Tayto and bacon fries They showed the rugby world cup matches and the Ireland v Netherlands football match they had the commentary on throughout which was great for the atmosphere in the pub
Great spot This has an authentic Irish pub atmosphere Pub is in the heart of Budapest Staff are lovely and made sure we were looked after all weekend long Highly recommend
Watched Ireland v New Zealand World Cup game here Atmosphere was electric with lots of different nationalities watching the game Food and service were top class I felt right at home 
Dirty things are flying in the beer I asked the staff to change our beer she keep telling me the rude thing in hungarian Even i got the new one still Nem jo
Good Central location so ideally placed for the passing tourist Pleasant girl behind the bar good selection of local and import beers and other beverages Good prices too except for the crisps
Good selection of beer and good atmosphere
Service was terrible Firstly waiter ignored us for 20 minutes while doing nothing there wasnt many people so he wasnt busy He had a rude attitude and was acting like we were bothering him and for that they even charged 12 service fee which btw is not written anywhere Definitely not gonna return
Spacious bar We went based on the food reviewsbut it had a small menu and overpriced Drinks were good however we reordered drinks twice and were forgotten about on both occasions  Nice sports memorabilia  But definitely some improvements could be made
Very good food and extremelly pleasant and efficient service This is the first pub in Budapest without the mandatory service charge we came across so we knew exactly whats the cost of each item on the menu That made our life a lot easier and we were more than happy to leave a tip of course
We were charged for 15 liters of beer and a dish that no one had ordered or seen This behavior is very unpleasant after I had been going to this pub for 2 years and invited my colleagues to a football match The waitress simply did not bring me my beer but added it to the order In the end the owner of the pub came out and told me that I had booked a table and had to pay for everything I dont recommend it so as not to be disappointed in people
We went to catch some NFL football on a Sunday evening Like most bars it competes with the main soccer game but they do pit it on at a secondary TV Its usually one game and NFL RedZone Its a friendly bar with decent prices and  you get to meet some fun people The bartenders are approachable unlike some of the other bars we went to in Budapest that are so rude and either hate Americans or are just too cool for school I also ate a burger while watching the game The menu is a hodge podhe of traditional bar food nachos Fish and chips and some odd surprising items Thai curry Anyway the burger was respectable and hit the spot And the Irish coffee perfect on a cold night
Love this place Great pub with a homey atmosphere but it is also very lively when the games are on or live Music is playing The staff is always great the Guinness is always on point and they offer a great whiskey portfolio It is a bit pricey but compared to the rest of the Irish pubs it is perhaps the cheapest and there are affordable options for those with a tighter budget One of my favourite places in the city certainly the best Irish pub in Budapest
Great music atmosphere nice variety of drinks Steak with Guiness pie was to die for We will be back 
Dont know about anything else but the Guinness is the best Ive had outside Ireland Im from England and it beats any Ive had there
Lovely place to grab a pint of Guinness or a Magners The staff is very friendly and makes you feel at home  Update Stop in for the new Irish Pub menu The Bangers and Mash with Caramelized Onions was spot on The burgers are a big improvement over those we had on our first trip there Well definitely be back to try more of the breakfast and dinner offerings
Best place for both Goulash soup and drinks Please look no more I have visited Budapest several times and this is the best I had a traditional bottled beer a Dreher tap beer and a raspberry lemonade It was great flavour and price Next day I had to eat in a place called Europa restaurant and Cafe some 100 meters from the Celtic Pub and it was the worst food I had ever eaten in Hungary 
We sat on the terrace  which was delightful  Servers were prompt  kind patient and helpful even when we were indecisive  Both of our meals the garlic prawns and the grilled chicken breast were excellent as was the Limonade We did not enter the restaurant Close to public transit  but far enough away that street noise was minimal  Limited motor traffic in front of the restaurant
Firstly I would like to say that noone asked for this review like in the other pubs If you are reading this you should visit this pub Nice stuff cozy atmosphere and veeeery delicious food We ordered tokaji stew and hungarian grilled pork with sausage Both was amazing Also you can find 05l beer for 5 O Enjoy sour cherry beer cheers
This is one of the hidden gems of Budapest Excelent service the cold beer was on table almost instantly you dont see this in Budapest Food was excellent we had paprikas goulash tokaji beef stew grilled meat with greek salad and Somloi galuska I highly recommend this place
We were here to kill some time before our taxi picked us up to go to the airport we orderet tea pizza and frenchfries We had to wait roughly twenty minutes for out food but that was perfectly fine because the rather sassy answers of the owner to negative reviews greatly amused us while we waited The pizza and fries were absolutely delicious and the staff was very very friendly If you are staying in Budapest and have a little time to spare I would absolutely recommend this establishement
Randomly hopped in for a beer we were satisfied with the place
Somewhat dirty and very loud place People are loud beers are not really good for my taste and fairly expensive but okay for the area People were smoking all the time so we left after 1 beer Smoking is allowed on terraces though in Budapest so I guess thats okay
Title Deceptive Pricing for Tourists  Review Beware of this pub if youre a tourist My friends and I had a terrible experience here They charged us a whopping 5200 HUF for a beer and 6400 HUF for a whisky which is absolutely outrageous Its evident that theyre taking advantage of foreigners This kind of deceitful pricing gives a bad name to honest businesses in Budapest I urge fellow travelers to avoid this place and choose establishments that treat their customers fairly Lets not allow them to continue exploiting tourists  It was a brunette waitress inpointer kitchen  she didnt give me a receipt She kept the money in her purse It was Wednesday night during the Sevilla Manchester City match after the rain
A good pub on the second floor there is an opportunity to accommodate a large company there are also tables on the 1st floor and on the street There is one girl at the counter of course its hard for her to cope with everything alone guests have to stand in line for a long time  The drinks are good the prices are affordable But I was insanely disappointed with the sandwich Firstly I waited for it for about 40 minutes It was brought only after numerous reminders It was cold The menu includes a hot sandwich with 2 sauces 1200 HUF Later the sandwich was warmed up but no one brought sauces they were simply not available   You can also buy popcorn chips and other snacks there Tip come to this pub full
Popped in for a bite to eat for lunch Not a big food selection but the panini was good so Im not complaining Friendly bartender and a nice atmosphere seems like a good place for a quick bite to eat or a beer with a friend
If you are Hungarian you might have a place here if not get ready to be mistreated specially by the tall tattooed bar woman I have never been to a place where they dont want to serve you She was horrible to me and my Brazilian friends from the very beginning All in all a racist bar Not worth it
Very bad service The beer glass had broken at the rim and a splinter of glass came loose and hurt my mouth that should not but can happen Worse is that the  uninterested young waitress didnt react at all and then unmotivated brought me some other cheaper beer No apologies no empathy I then brought back the wrong beer and asked for the bill The young lady cheekily insisted on her service fee which I refused Completely without empathy Tables werent cleaned either Probably not a problem for the bachelor parties present but for a normal guest it is A bar should invest in real waiters in order to survive in the long run Better go somewhere else to have your beer I dont recommend this pub at all
The location is nice and the food and drinks were also nice but nothing spectacular Its a nice little lunch stop It has to be a lunch stop as they dont serve food until 12 noon even though they have breakfast on the menu Regardless all in all it was ice and would return
Such a nice place Great food fast service and great music We liked it here a lot  Portions are quite big Better check with the waiters if its enough for two We ordered too much  Would come again
Happy hour is ridiculously cheap Excellent staff Seating spot on and toilets are the cleanest Ive ever seen in a pub The picture with tiled floor is from outside the WC downstairs
My burger and fries was good but it would be better if it was warm I hungry and I dont have time to return it 
Very disappointing and not even sure it is legal that beer prices were advertised clearly on signs but then I had to go to the bar to order and get my beer and the bartender added a 10 service fee without informing me or it being advertised anywhere Really not an OK behaviour
We popped in here for a few quick drinks Really is a nice bar The staff were great I highly recommend Billys Beer Will return
Went in for some food ordered drinks and were asked to sit down and the drinks were served to us Then waited to order our food and nobody came to take our order for over 15 minutes For this we were charged a service charge When we paid the bill the waitress looked like we had interrupted her from her phone Will not be going back
Good food Enjoyed the goulash soup and pasta A fine alcohol free beer Friendly service although it could be a bit more proactive Place is quiet and you have enough space Nonetheless it can get noisy due to echoing of voices All in all recommended and would come back
What a great find We were looking for Casanovas Pub but its closed Polo Pub was nearby and it turned it to be great We had the pork knuckle for two the pubs signature dish and it is cut up at your table Our waiters were attentive the food was great the pub is a great venue with an historic feel Very happy
The location is fine we got here because was raining and was the closest to the parking spot we found The serving guy was very friendly and checked on us to see if we were happy with the food The chicken papricash was very good I had hungarian rataouiile and was mostly yellow bel pepper I am not a fan of bell peper and that was a small issue The tea was fine My boyfriend had chicken with fried potatoes also good
The best service Ive had at a restaurant in Budapest if you want to be welcomed like old friends and enjoy delicious traditional dishes in a cosy setting then this is your place
 The place  small cozy very nice ambiance and live music nothing too loud  The food  I had the roasted pork and my girlfriend had the duck leg and both were absolutely delicious The goulash was fine but definitely not the best you will have in Budapest
Good pub with reasonable priced drinks especially during the happy hour The whole layout and service which was really good and friendly reminded us of decent Wetherspoons 
We spent two weeks here one night in Budapest   Happened upon this pub after a long day of happy hours and wine tasting  Staff was fun and we had many of their 1L beers  Went back to the scene of the crime the next day and it was just as good
We are two ladies from Ireland Very impressed with staff food and service here Staff fluent in English language and pleasant in every way Excellent choice on menu and would highly recommend PS background music very good
Great place but Im taking one star off because there was no conditioner inside just fan that was not doing much It was very hot and hard to sit there And this place is definitely not for families with small kids Old toilets no changing station no baby seat Service was very nice food amazing They recommended us very nice local beer and delicious cold lemonade I would visit this place again but not with baby
Great pub solid beer fine burger eatable baked potatoes good but not the awesame generally very good experience
We came across this pub whilst walking about Budapest and thought we would give it a try Me and 3 family members all had burgers and they were amazing No complaints at all and the portions were generous Couldnt fault them at all
Very close the Basilica and offers a good value beer
The drinks are incredible and very cheap we also ordered the potato wedges that was a great side for our cocktails Friendly staff and nice service definitely I will go back

Good place for grabbing breakfast and one of the few serving it at an early hour in the city  I liked that they have beer on tap and serve it when normal people have coffee because Why not  Ive had the English breakfast Not great not terrible but decent value for money  Service is great and so is the ambiance really good for grabbing a coffee a bite to eat and checking up on your emails
Awesome pub just next to our Airbnb in Budapest  The night we arrived we were looking for authentic food And found the Maverick pub  We were totally happy with the quality of food and drinks served to us What more do you want when you are traveling to a new country new place   We ordered portions of Burritos  veg quessadillas And Dreher beer from the tap  Authentic Mexican food they serve and great beer  Hospitality  ambience is superb   Must visit if you are looking forward to good Mexican food in town around Fovam Ter  
The portion was super generous and it was delicious indeedHot chocolate was tasty and staff was Pro and friendlyit has a amazing vibe which Ill definitely go there agian
Extremely unhelpful  They dont have a single vegan item and they are not willing to help either I tried to order just a plain portion of fries and they wanted to charge me for the cheese and bacon even if I cannot eat them Its a nice environment but they dont let you hang around even if youre a guest at the hostel unless you buy something here which I cant because they dont have a single thing thats vegan
Although it isnt really in the city center or on the tram lines I highly recommend visiting this place if you are willing to sacrifice a bit on taxis fares or you have a car it is in an old western design and the food is one of the best in debrecen in my opinion the menu includes all types of foods from vegetarian food to steaks Pay it a visit if you can
Great pizza
Friendly staff Good cooking has a bar reasonably priced In good weather you can sit outside
Its OK The staff is nice the food is average At least to my taste
We went to a footballgame and this is a very nice place to sit before the game You can get something to drink in the pub and sit in the redroom watch a game
Awesome service
Is full of excitement
beautiful place
Its in a secluded place



Cool place in the center of Debrecen  It has two floors and upstairs there are some sofas  The food menu is not very extensive but the food is exquisite  The drink menu is very complete  We ordered two different gin two dishes and a dessert  The price is like anywhere in the center  The staff is very friendly and they speak English
The food is very good the place is uniquely decorated wall decorations are amazing and funny and the staff is on point The only thing that made me rate it 4 stars is the portion size its smaller than usual But other than this everything was great
Great vibes exquisite food and affordable prices
took one hour to bring our order And the restaurant was empty That means the shef cooked only for us Food was ubeleivble tasty but it took for them hours to cook
I found the love of my life here I will always be happy to come back for a delicious vodkacola A mustsee when visiting Debrecen I can only recommend it Good prices fun atmosphere
Nicely served super cold drinks Pinter brandies Great service I can only recommend it

Clean cultured Fast intelligent service
The ugliest pub in town After every Friday and Saturday night every 50 meter radius looks like a garbage dump cigarette butts broken bottles beer cans and urine Real cheap crime The guests mostly stand on the street and babble in inarticulate voices There is no security guard or anyone to call troublemakers As far as I know even the people living on the street are driven crazy by this arrogant style in the spirit in which the pub is operated Not a place worthy of Szkesfehrvr
There are several soccer balls It is more popular among high school students The condition of the toilets is terrible as if they are never cleaned The beer is watered down
Good music good atmosphere four foosball tables comfortable seats this place offers a good place to relax on the weekend
Perfect for teenagers The bartenders are good people
The beer selection and the staff are great And the ermine is brutally good perhaps we have never eaten anything this good
What the Bavarians call the pretzel the Spanish the small fish the Czechs call the ermelin a wellloved beer skate based on camembert cheese
Very nice place

Great place if you want some Guiness on tap with some very traditional Hungarian drunk food Theyve got a darts board and a big front in which they have frequent live music It may be a little out of your way as its far from the center but it is well worth the travel for good beer and a great atmosphere
Hangulatos szuper hely Atmospheric cool place  recommend it to tourists too
A nice gem in the middle of the concrete jungle Quiet friendly environment with hospitality youd expect from your family or close friends A very good alternative to the noisy and upscale places where youd pay extra just for being there
Fun place nice setting warm hearthed owners who run the place loved it 
They dont mention that you have to self check in using their app which did not work on my phone There were  no staff on site to assist and none of the phone numbers worked Ended up going to a different hostel Was still charged
Very good quality price value Im an Italian cycle tourer riding the Eurovelo 6 from France to Black Sea and I found this hostel very nice Single room with two beds very quiet clean in the downtown of Gyor at a fantastic price I would give a 6 star if could I stayed 2 nights for rest in this nice town enjoying the sights and this room I cant ask more for this price Highly Recommended if you stay in Gyor
The hostel requires you to send photos of both sides of your id card for checking in This is forbidden by a number of countries to their citizens and opens the door to identity theft
Excellent choice of beers wines  spirits Both by local  foreign distilleries By the De Family Eg Worlds Best Gin 17 Hern  Old Tom Gin made from 8 organic botanicals among which Hungarian juniper berries Strongly recommended
I saw the bar tenders throw a street musicians guitar case out in the rain for playing across the street from their pub Not cool
Nice atmosphere nice staff So to sum upNice 
Very nice pub good service awesome view of people walkin by A good place to meet travellers and local volk
A good dive bar providing they dont play Hungarian pop
The quality of the food is average not bad for the price The service is below criticism The dirty appetizer plate remained on the table until the end of the dinner not a smile not a kind word if we wanted anything we would have had to wave and speak for hours With that much power you could eat in a fast food restaurant at least you know not to wait for service at the table I dont recommend it to anyone
The mood light is a little dark for your first reading but its a very cozy place
Beautiful
Kind staff apparently The toilet is not functional
I finally found a real Pub in Szeged Its not a plastic pub its exactly what a pub should be The service is 5 stars full information about drinks in a really friendly way The food is completely authentic and by the way divinely delicious Special thanks to the chef for the precise information The flavors spoke for themselves I highly highly recommend it to everyone 
Service is amazing Drinks for you A very pleasant family atmosphere Csemd peace and cold beers
Quiet Cozy yard Good expert service I can only recommend
A place with a great atmosphere nice polite service original Guinness on tap usually with nitrogen Its worth a look
Over the past 12 years the place has saved me from falling into boredom several times And yes its open Dear audience excellent chair legs
As a woman alone I wouldnt necessarily go in but there is a certain atmosphere when you ask for a beer on the way home and jump down the four steps
A real classy place with stylish Karakan counters Due to its 247 nature many bugs fall in but the knives dont fly anyway 
Very nice everything rustic and shabby but adorable Its like the animated movie The Lion King it doesnt get you at first but then you hear Jafrs voice from Aladdin and everything is fine Finally a pub where Aces are the quarry
Small ordinary pub
It only got one star because it has to be graded somehow Lots of jerks here In fact the servers I cant appreciate that Maybe so that the bottom
The bartender is drunk he doesnt give a bill Disgusting place Where can I contact the owner
Average pub but nonstop which is a big advantage
The toilets are always broken but the service is kindaish Its clean and spacious
Like Good chairs
Very lively  drinks very reasonably prices staff amazingly helpful lots of young people visit being in our 50s we felt very old but was very welcomming
Slow service filthy atmosphere However drinks are relatively cheaper than other bars prices in town
I love the atmosphere especially at night because they have a great night show and also I love the food quality and the waiters and waitresses are really polite and helpful you can have a great time with your family and friends here specially in summer cause you can use the terraceNot only the food was delicious but also the price was really fair and they have different type of Alkohol and non Alkohol drinks and you have many choices
Really bad dont go there just waist of time
The cocktails are delicious For the young people sitting on the terrace the late Saturday night cocktail party is not really safe because of the people passing by who are not sober
The waitress avoided work and was a jerk on top of that Everyone in our party behaved normally but the server always found something to get involved in and because of this spoiled the whole atmosphere I think people come here to have a good time not to be inconvenienced by the inappropriate style of a server Not to mention the fact that we booked an appointment online for 10 people 4 hours before arrival When we arrived they didnt even know about the reservation and we got comments like Why do they need 3 tables If you are unable to view the online bookings due to lack of time cancel this option as it may cause inconvenience at other times
The food is tasty The athmosphere is very pleasant and charming The drinks are plenty and there is a wide variety
Good pizza and nice selection of beers The reason why Im not rating this place better is because of the way they are treating customers If they mistakenly bring you a wrong pizza and you take a bite it is expected that you either eat it or order a new one paying for it because they cant give it to the right person This is not acceptable if you make a mistake you have to make up for it for the customer
Nice garden terace with great food and a lot of choices in the city center
Really great place with super kind staff big variety of beers and delicious food One of the best burgers Ive had 
Visitors are welcomed with favorable prices in a demanding environment Smiling staff friendly service An ideal place for groups of friends for bachelor parties
Perfect location kind service acceptable prices Darts billiards musiceverything you need
A quiet cozy pub in a calm environment nice polite service
Correct clean good service
Quick service and the taste is satisfy
Its nice  They have one good craft beer Which is somrthing in this boring town
Great food good prices
Nice
I do not recommend the place The owners behavior towards the guests is beyond criticism
The slogan attached to it is still stable better than opposite 
Great place great service and always a good atmosphere   
It is a significant advantage that there is not a place of similar quality in the area Fortunately Shamrock provides normal cultured conditions for a good friendly conversation
King The best place in Oros
The little girl at the counter is phenomenal
Very good place
Super
II the 15th stop of our pub tour in Kecskemt seemed to be closed at half past nine on Saturday night We got closer We found the covered patio door of the panelalja pub still open but the garage door only ajar Along with that we checked in and even though we felt that we were bothering we really wanted to have a quick drink here That was our argument nothing more So we replaced the usual glass of beers  Soproni and Mort Subite on tap  with a sip of Unicum so we didnt really understand the eponymous nature of the spinacheating sailor in the dark Its just that the character of the room which is paneled from floor to ceiling with the barrel ends on the walls and the wooden benches with stained glass is more of a wine bar even though the glass glasses on the shelves with the names of the winter sleepers are more like beer mugs  the Show me a pub quoting myself from a facebook group
The coffee is delicious The service is good
Beers on tap Soproni Mort Subite  Family atmosphere until 9 pm
Kind  cute  guestloving service 
Update the pub has moved house now it is located some 50m away at the other side of the Vroshz square right behind the Szchenyi statue Now serving Soproni  Heineken beers it has otherwise kept the style but in a much better building Longer opening hours and snacks  Update the only place in Miskolc with genuune IBAstandard Rusty Nail cocktail on  A classic location in Miskolc Built as a provisional workers barrack for a project back in the 80s this pub has tricked out all attempts for closure The design of the place radiates a special kind of temporariness of a place that had been marked for shutdown every year during its 30 years of existence to no avail With probably the nicest staff in the city the drink selection is relatively large with acceptable prices Beer of the house is Borsodi with Staropramen on draft here There is a huge outdoor terrace with a large LED screen and a stage for the summer and there is also ample space inside  3 former shops in this building were linked together to form a relatively large hall where serious bands play regularly with no entry fee In the pub proper there are several TV screens for watching sports also pool darts and foosball  Grizzly is a meeting point to most expats living in Miskolc
Very kind personnal and also owner of the pub which help to us in a few seconds when he listen that something happend near the roses garden
Its a nice place for drink some beers the music is good and you have the opportunity to play billiard and other games I think that the WC isnt the better one my girlfriend told me that the laidys WC the doors doesnt work
Central location very good for big parties Live rock music all year Nice terrace during summer season Reasonable prices Great variety Cash only
Hennessy 1300 
Iively crowd
dirty place
Ive been there once or twice But it wasnt called that then Ill be honest I dont even know when it got its name But thats not the point now The place has a cozy and sophisticated design I felt good here The lady serving was nice and professional If I have time I will definitely visit here Good luck money for the Farmer   I am writing my next lines on my second stay here At least the second under that name Nothing changed I write this in a positive sense
We went here to try magyar famous Unicum during Friday night Service was very quickly but as we are not a disco lovers weve just made a quick stop here But we got what we wanted
Good place to drink cold beer at summer period
Hmmmwhat can I say Honestly I did not like it We havent ordered from here yet It was home delivery We previously ordered approx afternoon to 1930 It arrived with perfect accuracy at 1931 Thats all the positives  The dough is thin The topping is not enough It was almost dry on the 2 mm dough The covid variety pizzas with the syringes are inventive 
INTERSPAR donuts are sold for HUF 900 which is HUF 299 at Interspar So much so that the paper cover is taken off it  THATS HOW CLOWNS WERE IN THE FRIDGE FOR US TOO HUF 299 at Spar
It is an average place Have good snacks and good drinks The price is low
Joyfull place in the middle of pandemic cold night
One of best cherry beer
The memories that there is something eternal and that gives the fantastic feeling of being invited beckoned  come sit down and enjoy yourself  thank you
5 star venue with amazing staffgreat night out at Ficzak
Very nice place with a great selection of well made cocktails and drinks Best quality used only Definitely a recomendation
Cocktail guy knows how to make killer cocktails Good stuff
Very nice location humble staff
If you like rock and metal this is the place to have a beer
WONDERFUL ROCK BAR
Beernroll
It used to be a good place I agree with the reviews from 23 years ago but the current state of the place is simply repulsive I dont recommend it to anyone
Great service great variety and price of drinks Many options of games
Nice people good drinks and cheap The PCs have great performances and the internet is fast They also have tabletop games playstations and foosball  So all in all great bar for gaming and such
Very friendly staff good cocktail options fun Recommanded for every gamer esport lover and everyone who wants to try out some special cocktails
Great place if youre into gaming super fast internet and also equipped with a full bar in case youre looking to make a night of it
One of the best places for summer vibes
A pure oasis of joy A very nice cafe
Its closed but very beautiful
I love this little cafe The ambiance is lovely and super relaxing   The coffee lemonade and cake are good The staff is just great  I recommend spending an afternoon in this little place a nice break away  from the crowds noise summer heat and sun
Optimum choise of draft always got guinnes kilkenny here snacks available not used such option to order from outdoor the food Stuff friendly spoke english good recommended to visit
Coziest place to get a mojito Became my pitstop for Mojitos amazingly priced btw and good service 
Laid back atmosphere in Ladadika area  Good variety of beers and simple menu  Food is nice and waiter is on the ball  seating inside and outside  Recommend highly 
The best pub in ThessalonikiOriginal pub with great musiccold beers and amazing food
Slow but good service  Perfect Guinness if topped up to the rim 
Very beautiful place to eat and drink Nice music excellent service yummy food
Brilliant place for a night out It brings back memories of how bars used to be Great music vibes cocktails spirits and brilliant bites and snacks I think amongst the top night out venues in Thessaloniki
Despite Thessaloniki being a cruise ship stop this spot was filled with locals with no tourists in sight  In our books its a good sign when the place if full but they have no english menus and the waitress struggles   The food was great we had the Irish burger and the pork chops  We would probably be regulars here if we lived in Thessaloniki
The best rock and roll place in Evosmos Nice beer really good music
Good prices Cozy atmosphere Alternative music Bar games
Needs a face liftbut the service is good the people are very friendly
One of the best Pizza ihave eat the last time
We booked for 10 people to celebrate a birthday They were totally rude lazy  waitress and at the end they never brought the receipt for what we ordered Totally unprofessional will never go back to that place although visited in the last year as many times the quality at the moment is very poor
Alternative choice for a beer on Antheon str Do not miss sausages with a cold pinte highly recommended
Cosy  variety of beers and very good rock music Missing 2 stars for low quality of drinks and cocktails though it is not that kind of pub and the smell of fried potatoes 
Now that is a pub Not in the British way but a pub where you can go and have your beer A wide selection of beersnot that I am an expert less for wines and of course a great variety of spirits Wheel chair access exists place for wheel chairs and strollers is available though using a bathroom is not a choice Music is not always from a playlist but there is also various dj s that perfom there Overall it is a really nice place with friendly people and polite personnel 4 stars is for the luck of parking wc for disabled and the lack of fresh air during winterkeep looking for updates when spring and Sumner arrives
Clean drinks rustic Irish ambience with that touch of Greek Mediterranean breeze in the summer and mountain lodge warmth in the winter  a very good for localneighborhood pubbar concept still young and fresh despite its many years of history and existence
A lot of kind of beers in a nice place near the center of Oraiokastro I highly recommend to taste draft or Czech Republic beers
You couldnt possibly find a better place to enjoy your beer The place itself is the best this town has to offer and the catalogue is massive its not far from the town and its definitely worth the short drive The stuff is always present and helpful as well as kind with good knowledge of every beer in that catalogue Dont omit to visit on Wednesdays when they host a live Cheers 
The best Beer Pub in Oreokastro and Thessaloniki A lot of different kind of beers and very good food
Cosy little bar with rare local craft beer options available The decoration is impressive the atmosphere is great and I hear that the occasional live music events are special Bonus points for the owner and staff they just get it
Amazing atmosphere and extremely friendly stuff We ordered something which was on the menu only for the holidays A weird beer And it was very good I personally like the decoration also Overall its a fantastic place
This rock spot lives for more than 25 years If you like this music you definitely should have a drink here One of the most legendary bars in the town
One of the few bars in Thessaloniki with an amazing catalog of Greek craft beers
I doubt that there is a better barcaf in western Thessaloniki and it surely is one of the best in the whole town Its catalog is large with many choices in all kinds of drinks Especially beers There a lot of draft options and even more bottled ones Also I extremely appreciate the fact that they promote and have a large stock of Greek beers not many places do that in this extend The staff is extremely friendly and helpful they really know their stuff on beers and drinks and they follow the hygiene guidelines for covid something that alas cant be said for many places I love this bar it is my favourite one in this city and Ill keep returning and recommending it to anyone
The perfect hiding spot to enjoy your beer Many people nowadays though
Best music in town Everyone who loves Indie Rock Punk and The Cure or Jimi Hendrix will have a nice time
Great place for a coffee stop or a cocktailbeer Ask for the beer plate its awesome 
One of friends had suggested that I go to this bar to try absinthe So I decided to take my friends there for my birthday And Ive got to say that this is a freaking gold mine of a bar The decor is gorgeous and the menu was spectacular But the music was the best thing about it by far Its mainly jazz but I honestly never expected I would hear my favourite jazz musician Im speechless this is a bar everybody should visit
Great late night bar with very chilled music Its in the party area of Thessaloniki Very central Prices are great The staff were friendly They play mainly music from the 1940s and jazz If you are a fan of this type of music then its the place to go for you I highly recommend it if youre in Thessaloniki
Very cool chilled bar Great staff and massive knowledge of cocktails You ask you shall receive Chat to Petros Super chilled Think Nora JonesStevie wonder jazz vibe
AMAZING Went three nights in a row 3 a shot with large range of flavours After staying there so long we also got a round of free shots when one was poisoned with absinthe
Quiet secluded place in this extremely loud city I loved it 
I just love this cozy place
Excellent couldnt have looked after us any better
Very nice place  but the heat is not enough in very cold days
Top notch hospitality and prices The perfect place to drink your beer in Thessaloniki
Nice and cozy with friendly staff and a great atmosphere The prices were great good value for money
We had a great night here The owner didnt have much English but he made a great effort to make us feel welcome and have a great time
best blue shots of alcohol ever Definitely will visit again
YES  its an Irish pub  The food quality and serving is just like a typical pub in Ireland  in big portions and the sauce tastes fabulous I even had a big glass of cranberry juice and said  Im grand   A special thank to the chef  Here I attached our delicious plates I will definitely go again I would like to have live Irish music from time to time and I wonder how its there like on a St Patrick s day  Irish dance  Missing the Emerald island   Its highly recommended to have dinner for a pint  chill out  watch the games and guess what With reasonable prices 
Since it opened in 2003 Ive been visiting this pub every time I come to Greece Maybe that says enough but I can spend a few words on it to explain First of all this pubs interior is beautiful and you can tell its established by a couple from Ireland Secondly the staff is always friendly and fast in serving you a good pint They have a nice and divers selection on tap and the same holds for their whiskey and whisky selection The food they serve is also delicious Besides their burger and Fish  Chips you should also try their Ribeye steak Its really good and one of the best Ive been served in a pub or restaurant Last but not least I like the vibe of this place Im not a big sports fan but its really nice to watch a game here just because of the nice atmosphere Next time I am in Glyfada I will go back because this place feels like home in Greece
Always pleasure to be here Great atmosphere and food A must in Glyfada
We sat down all is well in the beginning we order our food The waiter comes back 2 times to tell us that some ingredients for our dishes chickenare missing and we settle for something different TWICE Then after waiting for 40 minutes a different waiter comes back and informs us that what we order the second time does not exist anymore on the menu We got pissed so we just left but they still made us pay for the two cokes 7 even after waiting for 40 minutes for NOTHING If you want to eat this is not the place Glyfada is full of so many other better options
A fair local spot next to a church inside a small yard with parking they have normal prices few finger food  pizza low vol general music and ok customers for a very casual exit it is fine
Very slow and borderline unfriendly service It might have been a bad day for the staff but having to wait 20 minutes just to be given a menu makes everything after that harder to digest At least the beer was cold and tasty
Fun little place cozy atmosphere they even have their own local brew
Interesting parties very good prices alternative people and nice staff
One of the best experiences I had in Athens The food and drinks were spectacular The price was reasonable The restaurants service was excellent too The waiter was very friendly and suggested so many things for us to try
Recently named one the best 50 bars We have knocked off a few of these top 100 over the past year in Chicago Singapore and Athens We cant wholeheartedly argue with the assessment  What I can you that this is bar is worth a stop for sure after a long day walking eating and exploring Not sure if reservations are normally needed but we were lucky to walk right in and get a prime table Our service was attentive and worth the trip alone He greeted us promptly gave us recommendations and was there whenever we needed himeven though could tell he was busy  Id like to carry much of his accommodating attitude and genuine hospitality to some of our servers here in US and Vegas  The menus were formatted appropriately and took us where we needed to go if you knew what you liked  Enjoyed the music selection as was 60 seconds or less blurbs from songs we all knew masterfully mixedjust like the drinks  Even though it has been a long day the environment and prompt service cohered us all each into a second cocktail  If I lived in vicinity not sure it would be my normal hangout but itd be in the rotation  Stellar operations all across the boards worthy of the accolades
We were recommend to Clumsies for the best cocktail bar and to try their Greek salad cocktail We arrived on a Sunday and it was full and we were told no There was an event on in the city and every Grecian had attended the event and then gone out for breakfast coffee What was disappointing was there were children sitting at the bar taking up Valuable seating playing on phones while parent sat elsewhere drinking coffee How does the best bar turn away customers to serve coffee and let children sit at the bar  We ended up going elsewhere but would not be defeated and returned a few hours later when the streets were emptying out and they welcomed us  We ordered 4 different cocktails and 3 dishes and we werent disappointed Worth returning Thankyou
Stunning cocktail bar that certainly deserves its high ranking We loved the cocktails but more specifically the food The bao buns and the Greek pasta dish were spectacular Will be back one day without the kids
Great fun spot  Great beers on tap  The inside and out feel like a beer place  The staff was overly friendly  Also the bathrooms were women friendly Having a wife this is very important as she travels the beer world with me  This allowed us to stay and have more beer
Food took 2 hours to appear counting by when we ordered Decent but not worth the wait in the slightest A third of the freshly cut fries were precut Waiter was average  Edit bill was wrong as well Lowered rating to one star from 2
As proper a beer garden as Ive seen in Greece  German beer on tap and many in bottle  Nice sausages and a PROPER pretzel as well
Great place with friendly and attentive staff The beer selection on tap is great with a wide variety of several types of beer The Mix Grill is highly recommended as a side to your beer One of the best places for beer lovers in the area
Vibes of a British pub nice selection of beers and snacks and rock music of all genres A cozy place with friendly owners that has kept its character for more than a decade
Cute cute cute old school pub Its owner is a Greek Canadian and the pub is quintessential small town Canada pub Dark lots of paraphernalia  taps and bottles An array of old school cocktails  a menu that is based on what the bartender has in the kitchen  and really really reasonable prices Its a great place for expats feeling a bit of nostalgia and locals in the hood The owner is very sweet
One of the coolest pubs in Athens Many interesting beer options plenty of hard liquor delicious food amazing music cozy oldschool environment and located in a beautiful neighborhood in the heart of Athens
Awesome The most genuine pub in Greece Amazing atmosphere with a  lot of character There are darts of you want to play A big yard of ale behind the barman Its an experience
Custom cocktails Not typically a place to take a 4 year old but they still made a great concoction for him  2 even as the first one had fizz and he wasnt a fan If they can make something creative for my little man they can surely make something for you
Perfect cocktails Nice atmosphere Great music
I love this place Packed with local crowd The morning barista is making excellent coffee The cold coffees such as freddo espressoCappuccino are a delight
One of my favourite places to grab a hip cocktail in glyfada Make sure you add this place to your todo list summer or winter
Very small club where we were reprimanded for talking too loud Drinks are expensive as well Cannot recommend
Amazing spot Amazing musicmostly techno I dont even live for techno but this place invite so many great artists that I finally embraced this genre The crowd is mixed many queers Cis hipsters and girls Drinks are cheap they should offer more bottled beersciders Very good  one of the best bars in all Athens
The best of the best The source of the techno music in Athens 
What a surprise and interesting place to be explore in the center of Athens Nice place and the staff its very kindly

excellent bar great music and atmosphere and friendly staff has a vast beer collection and the owner always recommends us tasty different drinks would recommend
Best pub in the area
They make a great aperol spritz and bring you a little bowl of homemade popcorn every time you order a drink One of my favorite places to stop and have a relaxed drink
Came here over heated  Got cold water without even requesting it Got filter coffee beer  fruit salad and yogurt with chocolate    The fruit salad was super fresh and delicious   VERY good coffee yogurt was one of the best desserts my husband had had on this trip thats a quote   Really great prices cute waiter who was really efficient   This place is right next to Starbucks Black chairs You will be happy here
We had lunch here and it was really nice Tasty food friendly stuff  Didnt expect much from bruschetta with tomato jam and cheese but it was so so good  Service was amazing
One well made and designed place with good quality drinks and good musicevery day something diferent and serval events
Great place down a quiet side street  Chicken Club was generous and came with large fries  Perfect if you dont have much time  Also the microbrewery IPA was excellent  fruity and refreshing
We came to eat some nice breakfast  They have great coffee  and we had a plate of greek breakfast  It was so good that we skipped lunch and dinner  It is near the agios titus  Thank you for great service
We had breakfast at Crop on one of our days in Heraklion It was a good breakfast  very good portions for the price The food came out in a timely manner and service was fine The coffee was good but I do think the coffee at Frankly or Moasiac were better
Very nice place with friendly people   Really Testy food  The environment is very relaxing The people who are working here are very helpful and kind  I am really pleased   We took crock madam and pancakes Crock madam was 1010 and pancakes 810  I recommend it a hundred per cent  Also very important they make their own coffee from fresh beans and its amazing  Its a must
Food and staff were amazing The waitress was drop dead gorgeous and extremely sweet You tip them and they bring you extra food and drinks free since tips are not required in Greece Great location only a few blocks away from the main plaza in Heraklion Crete
The best all day wine bar  restaurant in Herakleio city You can start your day with high quality coffee and snacks continue with light lunch and close the day with a dinner accompanied with the most known Cretan  wines and selected labels from Greece and abroad
Just spent a week in Heraklion and when we were returning to our hotel in the evening we would pop into this wine barrestaurant for a few drinks For being strangers my wife and I were made most welcome and at the end of our trip we left feeling like friends The staff were second to none and couldnt do enough for us in fact we were given on the house drinks on several occasions as well as nibbles and cheese on our table The owner of the restaurant gave my wife a bottle of wine on  our last evening which was very kind of him to do If you are visiting Heraklion I would recommend that you visit this restaurant Again many thanks to all the people at this restaurant who made our stay so enjoyable
Great place for a quick wine tasting Lots of varieties by glass great service 
Great cafe and bar in Heraklion Its near the lion square at the heart of Heraklion I love their freddo cappuccino And the whiskey sour I tried was amazing I always visit this place each time Im in Heraklion I highly recommend it if youre in Heraklion too Prices are great too
Great menu variety reasonable prices  great food quality Service is fast  friendly
Newscafe is a really nice place in the heraklion market The hamburger was good The spaghetti was with a little extra oil than usual but is was good as well Great service and locates really nicely
So Im only giving my review to the bar staff since my husband and I went straight to the bar seating since he tends to think we get seating faster there In this case we did and I only think it was because we were out early which means 8pm I was on a hunt for a specific drink that is made with Mastika which I have previously visited other places showcasing a mixologist I ordered a Bar Spoon I swear after a hot day sweating from hiking or even shopping and carrying those bags You are going to love this drink it was perfection Plus like the signature drink name it comes with a frozen delicious spoon of vanilla Oh if anyone was wondering what my husband ordered he got an Alpa beerit was good  Music atmosphere staff were great and attentive 
This is the perfect breakfast spot in Iraklio The coffee is refreshingly great for the standards here the staff is very kind and the food fantastic
Loved the pancakes and the specialty coffee The area was also super nice between some other restaurants close to the city center of Heraklion
Very nice interior and exterior delicious breakfasts and nice waiters Came here several times while we were staying in Heraklion because we enjoyed this place
Great venue including for cocktails and food Staff friendly and helpful Sit inside or out
Extremely friendly and welcoming brewery and most importantly they have outstanding beer  If you like beer and are in Crete I highly recommend stopping by  I love IPAs and usually have problems finding good ones on travel but Notos was spot on
Very friendly people nice beer at good prices highly recommend paying them a visit if you like craft beer
You need to check the opening times very carefully but once you got in you are treated like a king Amazing place amazing staff amazing beer Dont miss this brewery if you like good beer
Amazing beer amazing brewers I have to say that they werent expecting us but the service the fun and the beer of this microbrewery were absolutely wonderful We are planning to visit them again next year and look forward to more great Notos beers
Stone is one of the best places in the city  Cool vibe  some young and some older crowd The music transitions depending on the hour  you get light rock some old and new hip hop maybe some pop  Definitely a must visit for a drink or a cocktail 
Amazing service creative signature cocktails awesome popcorn assortisment Also great design of the place and wide playlist of viby old school music Totally recommend
The concept is very nice Well elaborated cocktails with unique flavors Try out the Mexicano cocktail
Cocktails are aaamazing Recommend Voodoo bitch
Exquisite drinks from Stavropol every single time No matter if you go for one of the global classics the classics from his own creations that will withstand the passage of time or try one of the seasonal cocktails from the menu you simply wont be disappointed Great music vibes too
Outstanding cocktails best Ive had so far cozy space and music and friendly staff  Cocktails are 10 and differ in size but they are served with free water and full of rich flavor so that you canwill enjoy them slowly One cocktail even came with a piece of delicious chocolate which greatly complemented the flavor even more
The mixologist knows very well whats doing here Its the best cocktail bar I have been in a long time Try their Whiskey Sour its great
Really good cocktails  There are a few with very unique taste Its definitely worth trying
They didnt let us sit down inside in the sofas claiming that the sofas were reserved After 3 hours of sitting somewhere else nobody sat on the sofa or anywhere near that area inside that we wanted Bad shop policy unfortunately towards uni students truly unfortunate Im only giving 3 star because of the prices on the centre which are average and because the music was good
Lovely find on our day visit Exceptional food Great service and price
One is better than the other Atmosphere food and service Thank you 
Amazing place beautiful setting The staff were wonderful  so willing to help The sangria  cocktails were unreal I had the mushroom risotto which was lovely  my boyfriend had the chicken zinger which he enjoyed but said could have been a bit more flavourful Overall great experience  highly recommend xx
Thanks a lot Our first meal experience in Crete and it was amazing Great food and great service The waitress was super friendly and helpful
Very nice hidden restaurant with garden lid by candlelight Food and service both amazing Nice relaxed ambience and the girls were very friendly  Nice place for a date or dinner with friends
Great back yard with hipster vibe Menu has more options comparing to other local places An experience which shouldnt be missed in Heraklion
Incredibly nice place in the center of Heraklion Everyone is friendly and food is just delicious
Wonderful atmosphere relaxed like a spa  when I stopped in the afternoon in a quiet street Good coffee Coffee 1 l water and plenty of cookies 35 Euro
Very good food service and location Good prices for food The beer prices should be a bit lower especially for foreign beers The prices for beer served in the restaurant are almost double than the prices of the same beers taken at home
One of the best stores to spend your evening in Heraklion A vast collection of beers worldwide with amazing appetizers and deserts A must if you visit this city
This is the second time I have been here and served by the same very lovely waitress  She is so nice and helpful  I came again to have the exact salad I had the first time as I wanted to eat it again because its delicious Everything was so tasty  the sauce was to die for to be honest its drinkable   We were also given a stand with little biscuits on it before our meals came  After the meal we were given a dessert on the house of absolutely the best banana and chocolate dessert  Simple but extremely delicious   It was a fresh banana serves with fresh milk chocolate by the way we starting eating it before I took the photo I  was presented very nicely before drizzled over with dark chocolate I was told they make the chocolate and you cant get it anywhere else  It is truly a chocolate lovers delight  So on the menu  there is chocolate  chocolate and more chocolate   They have chocolate fountains and the list seems endless  One day I will go here for a chocolate dessert or drink of chocolate  Whilst there I saw one table have a very tall vessel containing beer so that customers can use the tap to serve themselves  Very intriguing  I have never seen this before Any sorry for the long review
Awesome guys We came to Patras and wanted a place to sleep when we werent in Patras we found it on Park4Night it just so happened the day we came was when they came back from holiday So moods were high and everyone was super laid back and drinking beer We had a couple of beers great taste my wife had a pomegranate ale and I had an IPA We ended up staying for 3 nights If you are in Patras dont miss out on good company and great beer
Awesome beer awesome people and every Friday the bar is open for everyone to try and taste all the new beers the guys keep on inventing
Excellent beer super cool people and delicious pizza when you can get it the guys there are very friendly and happy to show you how they make their awesome brews Its a hidden gem do drop by if youre around
Its heaven on earth Various handcrafted and sophisticated beers made with love by lovely people
Located in a small alley The food was just ok Lots of mosquitoes and couldnt dine inside as there was no aircon and was really hot Limited beer selection
Very good experience if i will be in Volos again definitely i will stop by Huge variety of beers and especially my favourite  Brewdog punk in draft Very nice and kind barman is big plus y
Relaxed almost romantic setting kind service and a nice selection of local beers and some great food to enjoy your beer with A favorite spot when in Volos
Nice place You feel like being in an Greek island  Friendly staff Perfect food and   Big variety of beers
Beautiful spaceous bar in Athens It has a pool table and you can play darts The owner is an amazing guy with a lot of love for his guests They also have a good selection of beers and liquor Highly recommended for everyone in Athens
Great atmosphere and a very friendly owner Wide selection of draft beers as well as bottled ones We tried the O  Donovans beer as well as the Monkey Brew divine Nachos were nice although a bit overpriced and we were pleasantly surprised with the chicken nuggets we ordered 2 portions Will definitely visit this pub again
Awesome pub Staff is great and helpful I really cant say anything bad about this pub other than that they need to kick me out earlier haha  The Cool lil futures they have are cool Irish pub design and pretty much everything made out of barrels plus a pool table darts and a foosball table
Awesome new bar The bartender is really friendly They have a huge variety of great beers here Definitely give this bar a try its worth it
True bar Excellent music great atmosphere and quality drinks Plus 8f you are a cocktail person you will there drink all the originals as they should be and much more very interesting creations
If you havent been there go The spirits the music the prices everything is perfect The only flaw is that there isnt enough spaceand it is too noisy sometimes
Good drinks Friendly staff Nice music
Among the best in Vironas for either coffee or drinks Polite and helpful staff combined with a cozy  and friendly atmosphere
Great place to have a few beers  The bartender is a jolly person who was more than happy to serve us and have a chat  They have a wide selection of beers on tap and canned  The chilled Guiness surely did travel well  Its got quaint stools making it cozy  The walls are decorated with interesting bar rules and puns  Overall a fun place to unwind after touring the island 
Original Irish pub with classic rock darts beer n whiskey darts hotdogs and sausage plates great people and the weight of its long history A must when in Athens a steki for us locals
Their pos is problematicIt didnt accept my electronic debit card and we had to swipe again and again my friends physical debit card until it went through They didnt issue any receipt
The best Irish pub in Athens Great music
Good atmosphere great food kind staff and great beer The music fits perfectly with the vibe and makes for truly a memorable experience Finally the toilets are clean and well decorated which was a pleasant sight
Great little pub in a quiet neighborhood of Athens off of the main strip Ross is always there ready with a quick joke or a story from back home in Scotland
Nothing better than some Irish atmosphere combined with excellent service and a good variety of beers and appetizers
Our favorite place to come especially for a beer we love everything about this pub the beer variety the pizza the burgers even the breakfast Ross the owner makes sure you feel welcome and all the staff is super friendly and happy to have us Even our dog is welcomed here Should give it a go  oh and I forgot to mention our favorite night is Friday xx  check out the photo 
Wandered in on a whim while exploring in Athens Servers immediately greeted us and seated us and helped us with beer selection Bathrooms were good and clean The owner was very friendly and helpful in assisting us in the rest of our day We planned to stay only for a drink and he was able to recommend a local restaurant according to things we were chatting about our expectations etc was excellent We talked about music and he even suggested some shows happening that we might want to check out 1010 would Sparrow again
The Lucky Sparrow Pub is hands down one of the best Restaurant Pubs I have ever been to This amazing place offers the perfect blend of great food incredible beer and an atmosphere thats just unbeatable  The first thing that stood out to me at The Lucky Sparrow Pub was their beer selection They offer some of the best beers Ive ever tasted and each drink was crafted to perfection The staff is knowledgeable about their drinks and they always recommended the best drink for my taste buds The beers were complemented by their tasty food which was equally amazing The flavors were rich and the dishes were wellprepared  The music at The Lucky Sparrow Pub is another thing that sets it apart from other Restaurant Pubs They play different genres of music each night with the most popular being rock and punk The music choice is excellent and it always adds to the lively atmosphere of the pub Sometimes they even have live music which is just fantastic  The Lucky Sparrow Pub also has a cozy and welcoming atmosphere that makes you feel at home The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and they always make you feel like youre part of the family This place has quickly become my favorite pub and I always look forward to my next visit  Overall I highly recommend The Lucky Sparrow Pub to anyone looking for a great Restaurant Pub experience With their excellent beer selection tasty food great music and cozy atmosphere they offer the perfect place to unwind and have a good time with friends
Best Irish pub in Athens There are also original Irish music live events sometimes
great service and a great selection of beer Good rock music too Advised to go to this bar if you like good beers
A NICE PINT OF GUINNESS  In an authenticly decorated little bar and in spitting distance from the port where the cruise ships dock
They insist that beef steak is medium and did not even inform the cook Argument is not an solution serve the customer please And please check in internet how a medium steak looks 
Amazing food everything was so delicious and very nice and helpful waiters
Very decent wee pub with a good WiFi connection and football  All three staff that have served mehave been very friendly with some nice small derail touches They also put the game on TV I requested  Food is good made to order and well presented Not the generic frozen pub food one finds in too many Irish pubs around the world And good portions  The chicken wings are good but the menu could state that one can order them extra spicy instead of being advised after they were served And obviously Celery  Blue Cheese Dip would be the appropriate accompaniment  Music is also good although there is a tendency for an entire album to be played So if you dont like that artist you will have quite a wait for something different  All in all a very pleasant experience and I will definitely make it a regular stop  Just steer clear of the Cider Vinegar  Sea Salt crisps They taste more like Cheese  Onion
Such lovely service Would recommend to anyone great music playing and great ambience drinks are good too 
Nice place with cool music and great service
Perhaps the best experience Ive had with my trousers on in the last 65 years
Unfortunately when we went there they had a very limited catalog to the point more than 50 of the drinks was unavailable and no food Got a tea was ok felt premade Service was slow but at least friendly
Great little spot for a drink and a slice when youre done with the ruins history and touristy gift shops around the Acropolis If Niovi is working and you like rum tell her to make you her favorite drink Its her own concoction and she refuses to name it after herself but it is truly amazing In the evening its a bit more crowded and the music is louder but the drinks are just as good 5 stars all the way from Baltimore
We went to this bar on a Sunday night to have drinks with a couple of friends The place is warm with nice music rockfunk was playing that night We enjoyed drinking and talking and afterward we just got the subway which is very close to the bar
Id give 5 stars if the drinks didnt cause me a horrific hangover the next day even though I didnt drink a lot Maybe I should have ordered bottled drinks eg beer instead Other than that polite and pleasant staff fun music etc
Nice place friendly staff but nothing special The place is very small in an ok location  Very hard to find parking around  It is a good place for a beer it has nice music also  Prices are ok 5 draft Beer  Accepts credit cards also
Every time I come to Athens I visit this bar With a big smile on her face the gorgeous owner always makes us the most perfect oldfashions weve ever had As youd hope and expect from a bar thats called oldfashioned Her taste is music is exceptional and runs the gamut from blues to classic rock and funk Sitting on the outside tables affords you the best peoplewatching view in the city A must visit bar
Stopped by to have one last beer before our departure in this cozy bar and we enjoyed our time The bartender was nice Just as we were paying by the counter and saying goodbye a cockroach walked over my foot and went inside the bar Never saw it go back out I guess it wanted to say goodbye to us too 
Fantastic bar off in side street with great music cocktails  it had wonderful lady employee who i think is manager she gave us free peanuts  our cocktails was very tasty she made  not filled with 70 ice like most places do lol  Definitely me  my gf will return hopefully with friends next time
Simplythe best Amazing drinks Amazing place Small bar with music that travel you years ago  the stuff is very nice smiling  and very logical pricesalso very important the drinks are real not fake just go
Incredible spot to bring a group or just a couple of friends Amazing staff and an even more amazing music selection I would also like to note that I was astounded by the huge beer catalog Something here for everybody There is a very pretty outside seating area with trees and a garden but also a beautifully decorated inside space for those winterrainy days  Please be warned that the place is not wheelchair accessible as there is a rather steep staircase right in the entrance
Wide collection of beers nice food great service good taste of music mostly rock What is there not to like
I loved the music and the atmosphere of this place Good variety of beers and very reasonably priced I will absolutely be coming back
Great place for a summer escape and more The variaty of beers its great prices are reasonable and the pub is equipped with both an indoor space and a yard Fully recommended for anyone that enjoys beers or wine in a aesthetic place
Its a pub with an incredible mood and chill vibes big quantity of beers and its the only pub in Ioannina which makes it unique as it is 
The best place to be if you are a Tolkien lover Great choice of labels as well
Fun open diverse spontaneous Smiling service young crowds
big variety of beers helpful crew clean place a good spot to chill on the outside or on the bar good music
My go to neighborhood pub Great staff great atmosphere
A good cool place to get some cocktails
Probably the only after hour bar at Holargos area Caf bar almost all day Beautiful interior decoration Nice interior preferably for the winter season Comfy outdoor seating  Mostly locals Great dj music 
This is a biased opinion because I regularly visit that place for many years now It has a friendly atmosphere to have your coffee or drink with your company Some nights the 80s mood on the decks can easily make you swing
The Ploughman Pub is an Irish style pub with a big wooden bar counter and very friendly staff Ofcourse they serve nice Guinness draught beer which is in my opinion the minimum requirement if you like to be called a publ but you dont find very often in Athens The beers variety could be better There are so many great Greek option that they can add to the list  The place overall is good cozy with great atmosphere and average prices I would definitely go back again but only to drink some beers because it needs some major improvements  The music choices are a mess they can try to keep a style at a time find playlists online its so easy nowadays or at least put some DJs and make thematic days like Rock Mondays  KPOP Tuesdays XAXA Thrash Thursday etc  Last but not least the food was bad Its really bad No imagination at all and poor execution I tried the beef burger and honestly I could easily give it back Oily overcooked preboiled  french fries and indifferent burger breads combined with a plain beef burger  Edit Unfortunately my opinion after my second visit is worse They brought us two glasses of water stained with lipstick and when I asked them to replace them  they brought two other stained with oil So now I question the overall hygiene of the place I definitely wont go back again Too bad
Descent place with nice atmosphere Kind and pleasant service staff The music was good also The only thing that cost the fifth star for me was the shortage or non existence of a Weiss bier
Five stars no doubt Visited so many bars and pubs in Athens and I cant compare it to any other place After living in Kifisia for 8 years I hardly been anywhere and now that I discovered this place might become a regular here Too bad I came at a bad timing because of the working hour regulations would love to see how the night goes in this place So off to criticism Despite the regulations the outside area had plenty of people The prices were pretty on as well Not a huge beer selection but it had all the ones I love the most The staff was really friendly and down to chat something that is pretty rare in other bars and pubs Ive been to Music was pretty chill but the server explained the reason Usually it plays Rock and similar genres Loved the decoration as well gives you a proper feeling of a pub Until next time I guess
Its pretty much the only pub in the area where you can sit down and enjoy your drink It usually has classic rock music playing in the background which sets up a nice atmosphere The prices are slightly picked up but still affordable
80s style bar with very nice music The service is excellent and the staff very friendly The atmosphere is returning you at 80s It is more for winteras it gets very hot during summer Easy access with buson a central street
Very nice place and very vintage
The real Athenian bar experience Excellent drinks music and staff Do not miss
Wonderful staff good drinks good ambiance Perfect place to catch up with someone or drown your sorrows
One of the most popular places in the area and with good reason Decent food very helpful and smiling staff What I like most is the location though Its trendy and classic at the same time Youll meet people of all ages and styles
Always a service with a smile Very nice food and superb coffee Very fresh during the summer with huge outside airconditioning 
Nice mushroom risotto but they took away the heater that was near our table and gave it to another group of people that arrived while I still had half of my plate full  I have to say that I eat fast it was a really cold evening and I wouldnt have chosen to sit there if there wasnt a heater When we were asked if everything was ok I complimented the food but complained about the heater They said they will try to find another one cause they didnt have one at the time They didnt
Awesome cocktails sweet music great service one of the best in northern burbs and athens in general Good looking people around all the time
Great and cozy for groups of friends  Great DJ Great barman Mitsos
Great beer choices Tasty savory dishes Affordable prices
A huge variety of different beers for each taste The place is nicely decorated though we went when it had Xmas Decorations so it was extra decorated and festive The food was decent Will definitely come back soon
A bit over crowded Guinness  food were just right quick  friendly serviceMusic was not bad but way too overheard classic rock for my tasteMost probably the only decent option in the area
We used to visit very often and had the same menu again and again specifically the huge pork schnitzel but after our last visit I believe they changed something in the recipe it just wasnt as good as it used to be totally disappointed  overall they have an amazing collection of beers to choose from and really big platesportion wise we totally recommending it Enjoy
The music levels are really high so you have to shout at the person next to you to have a semidecent conversation Left the place with my wars buzzing The large meat portion was not enough for 3 people and had way less variety compared to other beer places in Athens Draft beer was nice
Good place to hangout with family and friends Friendly service and the beer options are wide Im glad my friend took me to Arch beer house
When you are looking for a beer house in Athens you certainly dont miss Arch A spectrum of choices in the beer menu is more than satisfying Best case to try the drought choices These guys know how to deal with meat in the kitchen It is located on a pedestrian street and there are tables outside Parking around the area is quite easy
Nice pub  bar spacious and atmospheric The beer menu could be better with more selections
Live music Good prices Fast service Close to train station Trendy and rockin people Easy parking at night Good coffee as well Very nice decorating Yes I like We like My group like And a variety of beers Crowded in nighttime
It is now selfservice again It has enough space between tables so you can keep Covidfree distance And it still keeps the great warm and welcoming vibe with the music and the beers we love
There is no place like this Big barrels of draft beers and extra qualified stuff Lovely wooden decor that gives the right impression for a pub Sometimes the place organizes live music with bands of every kind and theres a section for playing darts
Its a fun little place that charm and plenty of outdoor seating heated The drinks were made well and the service was attentive A nice local restaurant to catch up with friends go out with large groups or just have a nice dinner alone
Really great restaurant bar in the area of Psychiko The food and service are really top notch albeit not cheap I recommend the Kritharoto which was tasty and as spicy as necessary
Wow what a great place good atmosphere Great sea food The seabas the octopus and the shrimp was delicious The cocktails unbelievable and the desserts ohhhhhh See the pictures Sometimes started before taking them Must return again
Very nice and stylish barrestaurant in Athens A bit pricey of course but interesting dishes and flavours
Good rock music good food a nice decor really friendly staff   The food and tap beers prices were ok  however the bottled beers prices were 20 higher than other similar places 1Very few 2 or 3  IPA  choices 2 only 3 beers on tap which are strange for a beer house
Having been inspired by a trip around Ireland some years ago the landlordowner has created a really pleasant place to have a drink with friends There is a good range of beers available along with a few ciders Im no expert on beer so cant comment more than that but as a place for a drink with friends its a very good local pub They serve some food too but we didnt sample that
Good variety on beers and nice food Prices are ok Not cheap but not very expensive Stuff is experienced and helpful All in all a good experience
The place will benefit from a better kitchen extractor
Been here dozens of times A perfect combination of pub and brewery Have tried more than 50 of their superb craft beers
Amaizing beer from a local brewery  It is in the area of Chalandri it is not in the central market but very close and it is an absolute pleasure to try their own local brewery brand Anastasiou  Everyone is super friendly and helpful the beer is worth it and the atmosphere is top notch You will enjoy it
Excellent beer selection and inhouse taps Very friendly staff that are informativeknowledgable of the local beer scene and the rest of the world Highly recommended for both locals and foreigners who are into beer
Simply the best beer bar in Greece and one of the best in the world Global selection including many US microbrews that are hard to find in Europe  In addition to a wide selection of Greek craft beer they have their own micro brewery on site creating their own line of sublime craft beers on tap
Nice spot well furnished broad range of beers having a dedicated menu only for beers actually even though not every one of them is available on the menu The service times are ok to slow at times but the staff is kind and friendly The prices are ok except from the food which can be expensive Its one of the biggest places in the area so even though smoke is allowed the smoke wont really bother anyone
Perfect place to enjoy your beer and food Really cozy place and the atmosphere Excellent service from the waitress top class You will see us again
We ordered 3 of     Every one of them was different missing ingredients they didnt have bread and instead put pita etc Very disappointed
One of my favourite beer houses in Athens Good selection of beers friendly service good prices great ambience They offer three litter beer for a great price They also have decent food recommending grilled meats platter and chicken wings
Great music great environment great staff  tasty food  80s90s rock blasting through the PA LOADS of beers  beer type food From burgers to Caesar salad to Mix grill platers The staff very welcoming  friendly  If youre a fan of beer  rock music this place is THE place to visit in the North
Excellent Food Beer and Service at a very reasonable price Meat platter was rich and tasty Iron Maiden Beer Approx 25 per person
Super
Love this place Great selection of beers friendly staff good food and amazing music
I visited on the Friday the rygbi World cup semi final of England v Argentina was on I was surprised that there were not many people there as the last time I visited Gibraltar was 18 years ago Anyway good bar and good atmosphere
The food is what you would expect from an Irish bar good but simple and I recommend visiting The servers are friendly so dont be afraid to just feel right at home Come in say hi and be friendly you will be met with a jolly reception a good meal and a few strong drinks
I dont quite understand low opinions on this place I ordered full English breakfast and Guinness Food was great beer also Very friendly man on the counter You can pay with card Also great music playing inside 100 recommend
Go for the very good Fish  Chips for the very reasonable price of 85 The Sheppard Pie was a big disappointment The rich gravy sauce had to be asked for and it felt like Bovril broth thicken with corn starch Add 2 pints of beers and 2 glass of wines for 20 expensive to me in vacation in Spain but maybe normal in Gibraltar we were at 37 Nice and typical English pub Good service Recommended  Yes but with the reserves noted above
Very friendly Irish bar in the square of the Post Office in La Lnea just a few steps from the border with Gibraltar Because of that it has a very international atmosphere combining foreign tourists and expats many of which are regulars youll see enjoing their daily cider in the terrace which has a misting system thats very useful in the summer heat  And dont miss their 3 pints on happy hour Monday through Thursday from 5 to 7pm
A fantastic Irish bar with should a great vibe Lovely pint of Guinness live sports on the TV The staff are very welcoming and friendly And the local customers are also very welcoming and chatty Worth a visit
Nice little bar and staff Great place to watch sports or just sit and relax be back soon
Bit iffey Went for first time 0323 with high hopes which were dashed on the floor of mediocrity Irish booze and speaking English is not enough Strange layout and very average staff An activities and music programme would help a lot I live local but its not gonna be my local
The three owls is a cosy local pub Not restaurant or wine bar but a proper pub The bar staff are attentive and friendly There 3 floors open on busier nights with pool tables on every one Drink is cheap but good quality and double doubles during happy hour are the best value in Gibraltar  Its a proper pub
Excellent local pub with the best Guinness Ive ever had And no the beer wasnt warm
Super pub small and welcoming The staff are great If you want an old fashioned boozer in Gib with pool tables go here
Went in for lunch befor leaving for home  Had a Jamaican curry very nice had to ask the staff what was in it as I am not to keen on nuts in my dinner lady was very helpful Never had this perticuler curry befor so I did enjoy it so did my husband  Even though we where in a pub we where flying home today so it was coffees for us Prices were very good well worth going to in gib 
Mojitos were fine lemons instead of lime but the staff was very slow even tho we were the only guests
An amazing Irish Pub now I know why prople look for Irish pub so much In this small town  of southern Spain where there is not so much people all the pubs and bar was not as crowded as I see in other big or medium cities but in this particular bar it was overcrowded People were dancing and moving their bodies with music all the time 
Had high hopes for watching the JINX live at Molly Blooms tonight but my hopes were dashed or maybe it was just a real jinx At last i thought a real decent Irish singing Band in an Irish Pub but the music was no more Irish than my local Salsa Bar They may have been singing in English but it was hard to tell as they were so so loud I asked barman if he could turn the volume down a bit but he looked at me as if i was an old fuddy duddy and refused so sadly we left with a real bad taste in our mouths In conclusion over loud over playing and over here
Irish pub that has Spanish women serving who hardly understand English and have no Irish music on the sound system Had to listen to modern Spanish pop music Am going across the road to The Liffey Bar instead Disappointing
Great place
Typical bar to go with friends to have a decent drink Do it if you know what youre going for In this case chatting and rambling about their own and collective existence and current affairs while having a good beer Who knows perhaps the cradle of a movement to solve current problems
Lots of variety in drinks and beers it is a cozy place with a good atmosphere It gets very good when there are soccer games since there are sofas with tables and screens throughout the place
There is a variety of beers billiards table football the style of the trocadero is vintage super cool Very good atmosphere people of all ages The best place in Algeciras
Really cool British pub with live music at the casemates square We enjoyed a perfect late night with some drinks and live jam
The first pub as you enter the walled area of Gibraltar through the Landport Tunnel is the Lord Nelson in the corner of Grand Casemates square Its got a lovely cool interior due to the Thick Walls and AC Outside theres seating with shade where you can take in the ambience of Grand Casemates Square people watch and possibly hear some live music The club sandwich and the Philly Steak sandwich are fantastic
One week ago I had a nice evening at the Nelson Together with some colleagues i went there to listen to the jam session and get something to eat All worked out well We had a table a waitress was friendly and fast the food and beer was ok and the musicians played and sang not too bad  Last week it would have been a 4 star feedback and so I went there again tonight  But today I think I was in a totally different place Same time but not the same spirit The guy behind the bar was very effectively avoiding eye contact That other fellow who fiddled around with some coasters looked through me Obviously he did not consider asking a guest if he could help  Only by asking that fellow at the bar after some waiting I got informed that there is no food available tonight  I thought Germany has a reputation as service dessert but this place tops it So if you want to play service lotto try your luck here If you want to be sure to get food and service better go somewhere else
Great pub always come here when visiting with RN Now on a holiday still come here Great atmosphere as always great food and drinks and superb staff  Victoria is fantastic and tentative to all guests to the bar  Breakfasts this last week top line
Had a drink here a few times and ate here once Food was hot but overpriced for what you get Toilets are disgusting and smelly and need a complete refit Staff are friendly but its far from the best pub in the area 
I usually post very balanced reviews but I am afraid I am struggling with this one Pleasant enough staff at what looked a friendly and busy place Plenty of space outside if not a bit cramped inside Anyway I usually take notice of the condition of the menu as although you dont eat it  it does tell you a bit about the presentation of the business On this occasion I did not Neither did my wife trust her instincts having ventured to the WC Neither of us spoke up and so we stayed I had the fish n chips which should have come with peas not mushy and my wife had the Scampi again with peas No peas turned up as they must have rolled off the plate We did however get a bland salad The same could be said of the scampi which my wife commented as being the cheapest and worst Scampi she had ever eaten My Fish was also very disappointing The one minor positive was that neither meal was massively expensive less than 10 each Nonetheless we would not eat here again having left this time very disappointed Oh Perhaps you could also throw away your chipped plates and tidy and clean the place up a bit Based on this visit we would have to say avoid
Food was fantastic and at uk prices lovely pub great staff been drinking here since I was a young sailor in the 70s
Cant understand the bad reviews  the food was excellent and the service was nice and engaged We had a lovely time and would highly recommend to go here
Skull bar now Weird place skateboarding on the tv Bright and again weird but thats Gib Open late
Lovely cosy little bar with super friendly staff a professional pool table  darts board
Lovely little bar tucked away just off the high street Pool darts and tunes all made for a fun night
Staff are great especially andrea she has great conversation chats to her customers very friendly you can watch the sport
Expensive fryer food We knew to expect fryer food but the costs seem incredible for the tiny portion sizes and basic food Definitely try somewhere else if you have kids
Had read some poor reviews about this place but dicided to give it a go it is what it says a burger  and dog  bar we ordered and must say were very happy with what we had good portion friendly staff tasted good cant say any more so dont go by all reviews and give it a try
Would not suggest to eat here If you like sport venues  then just pop by for a drinks Smallest Fillet steak in my life And not clocked properly Price 1995 Ribs looks good but does not separate from the bone So jut visually good
Our favorite spot during our trip to Gibraltar They have Guinness very well poured and we love the whole scenario as well all blue and full of life in the sea just beside us Amazing
It is a great place to catch up with friends or even watch sports if youre in Gibraltar Good selection of food and drinks In the arena as part of the casino complex
Very bad experience service is really poor lots of confusion with our order no single apologies for mistakes In addition we were tricked about 2x1 pizza offer which appeared to be not existing there Better to avoid this place
Good location overlooking the marina Its usually quite busy so get there early if you want good seats Stool we were served promptly There is a large screen for sports events and the toilets were clean and modern
Very nice location Ideal place to meet up with colleagues and theres usually a multiple choice of live football matches during the weekday evenings Drinks are reasonably priced with some great deals and my experience of the food I had a Grand Slam Calzone Arena Burger and the Boss Hot Dog during my stay was very good  I would agree with the people who say there can be a wait on food and drinks though but that depends on how busy it is when you attend  During quieter times the staff were very swift and friendly with their service However it seemed to be a lot more disjointed when there was live music on and it felt like they might have been slightly understaffed I do know that this can tend to happen unless someone takes control of the situation
Mainly outdoor restaurant on Casemates Square We were tempted by the sign saying Homemade Paella Sangria for 350 was all right Seafood paella was a large portion minimum 2 people and quite quick despite being told it may take 30 min But it was a little salty and bland It had prawns and one type of fish I think
Lovely food price and most importantly  fabulous owners Great selection of food options and not pricey  When next in gibraltar I will definitely eat there again
I had way much better fish and chips in London then here also the other meal me and my friend were eating here was not good the fish was dry so the dont have a clue how to make fish in my opinion  prices are higher then in the UK  you also have to go inside to pay and WIFI was not working when sitting outside
Great paella   Didnt get a picture of the food this little guy however loved the squid from the paella
Sat down outside mid walk to take the weight off and have a drink No table service Had the mango tea which was a sugary water Wont be rushing back
This place is ok if nowhere else to go Toilets are not very clean
Staff fantastic to get on with Have a laugh with them an fantastic service thanks see you all again soon hopefully
So excited to see Gibraltar is not bubble tealess again Really great bubble tea lovely team and reasonable price Especially love that they were happy to put it in a glass jar Id brought with me to take away so I didnt have to use the dreaded plastic cup My only ask would be to get oat milk in as Im not a lover of regular milk Either way Ill be back
Very much an Irish pub I had the vegan burger which was the best one Ive ever had Service was super The seats were a little uncomfortable and the bathrooms were definitely bar bathrooms
Awesome place for a good dinner or breakfast  The service is quick and very friendly always up for a chat about whatever  We got an Irish breakfast there which we thoroughly enjoyed it was quite large meaning we didnt really have to do a lunch Which meant it was fully worth the price it is
Surprisingly the best food we had in Berlin The nachos are honestly the best Ive ever had and we all went back an extra time to get them again  Great place for some cracking grub and to catch the football whilst your on holiday
Good bar with lot of space and screens available to enjoy sports We visited to enjoy cricket world cup finals It would have been better if there were more food and drink options We all felt there were very minimal options
We had the best time here the food was great especially considering the price The atmosphere was fantastic we came across a very lively group of people at a gig here who lifted everybody off their seats for a good bit of dancing A night to remember indeed Definitely coming back when I return to Berlin
An absolutely amazing traditional Irish pub in a great location in Berlin The staff are all super friendly and the service was great There is a great selection of food with some great tasting traditional German options
The pub is great but the food I had was terrible I made the mistake of ordering a vegetarian shepherd pie which looked like it just came out from the freezer The taste was bad too salty and not good flavours It is a shame as the beers and prices are really good as well as the service team Would have love to come back as a regular but the food is not worth it It is clearly intended for the tourist coming to see Checkpoint Charlie
Absolutely love it here Highly recommended A great pub with great atmosphere in the middle of Checkpoint Charlie Very good prices and food pretty good too Staff work hard and the Guinness is on point  Thanks peeps Slinte
A good Irish pub to go for some drinks  Thanks bartender Alex for the great service and recommendations I enjoy the atmosphere and time there Good selections of long drinks and shots
Great atmosphere good beers selection  Very friendly and nice staff  Snacks selection could be better but its not bad You can pay by card including Amex great
I live in Steglitz since 2 years I found this place at the beginning of my relocation I loved it The vibe atmosphere staff food everything was amazing Unfortunately last 3 months the staff strated to be rude The bartender and a young gentlement are the only ones that can communicate nicely and being helpful I am not going to give description of those who are unfriendly unhelpful and forgetting that they are in service industry Me and my partner decided to stop going there after he went there in the afternoon for a reservation and being treated unhelpful unkind this was the last drop after many other rude attitudes when we go there You are an amazing pub beautiful kitchen beautiful musicians And first of everything you are an Irish Pub Irish people are the most kindest Hire people who understands where they are working which industry they are working in and also respects the Irish Pub mentality I am absolutely sorry writing these and our decision of not coming anymore But I wont accept being treated like your staff do when I want to enjoy my time and come there to get a service
It doesnt look Irish outside and then you go inside and it is like Dublin in there Loved the wall decoration Food is not super Irish Pub style everyone were looking for spare ribs Burgers were super and my salmon sandwich more than expected I had a bit trouble finishing it  Service super Waiter was awesome
Not great machines for gambling at rear and attracts some odd folk Service OK but wouldnt return here  Only 1 other customer drinking whilst we visited no vibe or craic
Friendly about very small bar service is slow but with a smile  I felt welcomed here and would visit again
Good
Great pub owner very friendly and put music on for us great time
This pub has become a little tired in the past 17 years since I last visited Conveniently located inside the Europa centre Apart from the name and a few Irish signs there was not much to make it Irish The beer was cold and went down well but higher price than other German bars On my Visit the staff out numbered the customers
Went there to watch fifa finale with my colleagues The pub is hug with many different zones to sit and watch games on big screen Beer was good and service attitude was appreciable Will try to be visit again
Atmosphere good service very good Expensive Overly dark toilets Found the place oppressive as no windows in a shopping centre Disappointed at the Guinness which was average at best compared to a normal British pub
Not a lot going on when I visited as it was mid afternoon Some things stood out though Barman cant pull a pint of Guinness and the prices 750 for a Guinness is just a rip off especially when its pulled like that 7 for a bottle of non alcoholic beer as well
Avoid this place the owner will personally make sure you know that youre not welcome We simply asked if they were showing the IRE vs RSA rugby World Cup game in an Irish pub to which the bar staff politely said theyre werent We thought no issue we may as well have a beer anyway When the owner was informed of our request he sat near us to speak with a regular quickly switched to English and proceeded to loudly proclaim that we were rude and he hates seeing unfamiliar faces Its such a shame because its a lovely pub and the other bar staff were so nice
Excellent place great beer at reasonable price Great owner who is cheerful and friendly with an excellent taste in music All premier league games are screened and there are some fantastic shirts on the ceiling
Cool atmosphere Beautiful people Angry barman He can be a bit more polite and welcoming
Great place went there for an Arsenal game The place has very friendly staff rare in Berlin and good prices I shall return
Guinness here is unreal legendary and hospitable bar staff Worth a visit if you enjoy a pint and a chat
Great spot Great Guinness great staff and owner who is Irish Karaoke was great with great crowd  will return live music too on select nights see website
Nice pub with great outside seating and an actual Irish proprietor who is a good fellow I wish to tell him that I meant to recommend the Millers Crossing rendition of Danny Boy which In my beer induced haze I had swapped for on raglan road from In Bruges A grave error that he did not mock me for a good fellow
Was here on St Patricks day The crowd was great and the staff friendly even though they had a lot to do that night In the back they have a small stage where bands perform somewhat regularly In terms of Irish beers they have Guinness Murphys Irish Red and hop house bottle as well as some ciders like Bulmers They also offered BBQ food in front of the pub but I think it is only around for bigger events Overall a nice little pub to have a pint and enjoy the music
Cozy warm friendly and fast Delicious Shepards Pie and Nachos and all the Guinness I could drink with Cider or Port or Blackcurrant syrup too if you want the fancy stuff Lots of seating inside and out My fav Irish pub in Berlin
Nice local pub with reasonable prices Good option if you want to watch football Food is ok but nothing special I tried burger and fish  chips Service is friendly but they often forget to take away your empty platesglass and ask you if you want another drink I have been here three times during my work trip and I would return back even though it is not perfect it has a good vibe
Great drinks and delicious food good veggie options as well Nice vibe and friendly service  we went there three days on a row during our visit to Berlin  sometimes for a full meal other times just for a drink They show football games and other sport events as well Outside area is only open until 10 pm though
Easily my favorite place to watch Premier League Football The staff is great the atmosphere is always good and the food is okay but very good considering bar food standards
Nice atmosphere friendly and fast staff Good Irish pub with dedicated smoker room Food is tasty too Service outside starts in May
A good pint of Guinness in a nice cosy bar atmosphere
Definitely the best spareribs in town
I dont recommend it AT ALL Disrespectful staff smells reallly bad never seen such a bad ambiance Please try to stay away from this place as much as you can
Nice pub and good choice of beer
Went on St Paddys day and it was super packed The crowd is very local and German Highly recommended if youre sick of irish bars ripping off the tourists
Great sunny place to hang out and enjoy fantastic beers and delicious food
Best place to meet up with friends and watch football and join for pub quiz
Awesome bar Friendly service delicious food and drinks plus the prices are very fair The place to be for himymfans
The bar is beautifully decorated and has an amazing atmosphere Although our waitress was very nice our food took over 1 and a half hour to arrive We ordered the food at 1950 and received it at 2130 after complaining 3 times We have only ordered 1 burger and 1 plate of chicken wings why would that take over an hour and a half and we havent even received any compensation The food comes in very small portions my burger came with exactly 6 fries definitely not worth 16 euros If you like How i met your mother you should definitely give it a try but my own personal experience was very disappointing
The seats are bit tightly packed The burger was quite good and filling Burgers are available until 11PM only  Must visit place for HIMYM fan
We are a group of 10 friends come here and I would like to share our experience One of the male waiter  I am having two hands i cant bring your all food together and said us shut up and fuq out of here when we are end up with our drinks payed the bill standing outside Thank you for make us feel so daam good
Great Irish sports pub in the middle of Prenzlauer Berg We went there on Friday evening and the place was jam packed We enjoyed a couple of Guinness here They have multiple TVs inside where they keep playing football games There is outdoor seating for people who prefer quiet time
Good pub this Guiness is as it should be and service is great The landlord Rico goes the extra mile to make sure the customers are happy  On a Champions League fixture night when several games ran concurrently he even arranged the screens and customer seating to make sure everybody got to see the games they wanted with soundad hoc and last minute without stress or fusssuch good service is rare
Excellent pub for a Guinness and watching sports The chips were excellent
there is a very nice bar with democratic price for beer and cocktails and very friendly service
Not touristforeigner friendly Beer is about what you should expect from a pub but bartender was rude and kept speaking to us in German even though she knew we didnt speak it and had already spoken to us in English
Nice bar around the corner notting too special I had a whiskey double Jameson paid around 7 The lady bartender was nice to us and very responsive It is permitted to smoke inside so it is up to you to decide if you like that or not  
Axel is an incredible bartender and was incredibly accommodating I just gave him a look and boom like a magician he slammed a new beer down approximately 10 times I stumbled out of this place like a baby giraffe because of him This bar is as the most incredible place I have experienced in Berlin I HIGHLY recommend
Amazing Bar The staff is so extremely sweet and let us party and joined us for chats They are so nice and have great music taste All love to them
5 stars for being open on a Thursday night in Zehlendorf 5 stars for playing awesome latin music all night long 5 stars for an awesome bartender and overall vibe  If there was one thing it was the restrooms they could use some attention but Id definitely go here again
Nice place good beer 
This place is the best I come here all the time Really good costumer service and drinks
Shamrock red beer for my taste is really good Atmosphere is also fine Staff ok Klo clean Seat drink beer watch football and enjoy
The environment was so cool I also liked the music We came across two very cool men too which was delightful Suggested for a night out with friends
Proper pub no food Ideal for old rock and rollers
honestly one of the worst experiences I have had in a bar I am German so its not like we were tourists and the bartender kept yelling at us and talking badly about us because we did not order enough drinks in her opinion then she proceeded to tell us we would need to leave if we did not order more drinks very rude and unwelcoming atmosphere would not recommend going there
Great dive bar worth checking out
We had a fun night at this dive bar Affordable drinks and generally good atmosphere The darts were probably the highlight of the night even though Im not good Oh and the bar dog that visited though I wasnt sure if they were a fixture or a one time visitor The main drawback was that it was smoky inside which may only be a drawback for me since Im not a smoker
Homey kind of place reasonable prices and great atmosphere the people  I was lucky to find a live band there playing 70s and 80s rock ballads it was amazing  Service was good but they were a bit on their nerves because of the crowd and loud music  Danke
Local bar with nicest prices They have darts and pool too Too sad the smoke inside quickly disturb if youre nonsmoker
Probably the best pub in Berlin  they have the best waitreses have the smile on the face all the time so friendly place Thank you Marin for serve
An authentic atmospheric place for fans of Irish  Scottish tastes of beer or whiskey 
Great selection of Whiskey for a decent price The atmosphere is also amazing the nice folk music really sets the mood for drinking a proper whiskey Highly recommended place  PS the staff is very friendly and nice
Good atmosphere They have some darts a pool table and a foosball table you can tell by how much fun were having 
Great selection of beers very friendly staff and overall a very nice place Highly recommend
They made us pay 35 for a glass of tap water without warning us that it was not free

My recent visit to Berlin Pub was nothing short of a nightmare due to the appalling behavior of the barmaid Her hostility and rudeness were absolutely unacceptable leaving us feeling disrespected and unwelcome The barmaids consistent rudeness towards us and other patrons throughout the evening tarnished the entire experience I strongly advise against visiting Berlin Pub if you value basic courtesy and a pleasant atmosphere
The place is so bad the barmaid is so rude unfriendly aggressive and not even trying to communicate with people We sat for 5 minutes and she said this place is not free you have to pay and this is my place We tried to communicate with her that this is not nice but she kept insisting on her behaviour and didnt even apologize We left right away after this incident not recommended at all
The atmosphere and the customers were brilliant Mario was the best Thank you for a brilliant nigh
By far the worst service I ever experienced in a pub The bartender was super rude probably even racist I would say
Pub quiz and chicken wings are great Takes sometimes a while when its really busy but its a great place with a great atmosphere Fish and chips were a bit burnt when I went but usually they are good Can be a bit loud during the quiz so try not to sit in the corner because you will need to yell quite loudly
The food is good and generous the drinks are also good and somehow affordable Parking in the surrounding at night is not a problem at all The lavatories are clean The service personnel is friendly and easy to understand In all a nice experience but what Ive missed and would have improved my rating is the music  I suggest a typical Irish music or simply pop music in the background that would improve the general atmosphere 
Even if youre not Irish youll feel like you was Very enjoyable place to have a good beer and tasteful food very beyond expectations Even vegans wont stay hungry Vegetarian food can be altered to match vegan and still tasty Just talk to the ppl and enjoy
A great place to be I ate here with the Auld Rogue Burger one of the best burgers so far in my life Excellent taste and really spicy The staff is great too always available for a chat  thanks Josh for the marvelous service And the ambience is great as well And not to forget they serve draft beer like it should be  with the creamy foam  All in all I love that place
Beautiful little pub Irish only in name but very classy bar to drink and watch a little sports Good drink selection
Surprisingly good Irish pub
Good Music and good Beer
Top
What a cute little hole in the wall we stumbled upon heading back to the train station Had a few drinks and went on our way Friendly staff and clean spot Its a must go if your in the area
Guinessss beer  so thats everything you need  good old authentic irish atmosphere and decorations  small and cozy 
Good pub for a drink and chat can see locals love going there for an evening chin wag
Great beer Nice music and nice price Cozy and nice atmosphere Great place if you are into board games
It was nice pub With simple selection of finger foods Fish n chips was nicely done although i kind a expect it with salt vinegar in a paper  the burger chips chicken wings n chicken fingers were good as well What make it great is that the hot sauce It was selfmade and had kick I just couldnt resist to add buldak sauce in it to make it spicier
THIS IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE PLACE They also own The Bar Next Door THE owners amd staff are AWESOME You can watch Rugby and Football there Along with live music Karoake and comedy shows They welcome table reservations The food is reasonable and GOOD Parking is not that great so take the train They are near the SchwabStr stop
Quite nice place to have a different bear than what you can find in Stuttgart Most of the waiter speak English so it is okay Quite nice events such as open mic and so on They always have a different types of bear from time to time and a nice outdoor tables
Best pint of Guinness in Germany Chill atmosphere with a great staff My favorite stop in Stuttgart
For my experience it was very very nice  It so expensive great food and basically there are not a lot of places to eat in this area Stylish perfect nice beer I really liked absolutely all Menu photos attached if you want to see
I celebrate my Birthday there this year When the waiter found this out he put a Happy Birthday song for me I love it Definitely coming back
Good food it is a different feel than other Irish pubs not as lively but given the location and most ppl are stopping by before the theater its a great place for a Guinness and a bite Good ribs and good wings Ill definitely visit again Great location
Conveniently located this Irish pub is just what the doctor ordered after a long day at work With ample seating opportunities outside it is one of my favorite spots to unwind in Stuttgart Great selection of beers and the food is not bad either 
Super atmosphere and Services
TOP
Perfect
Super
Beautiful Atmosphre and great cocktais
Best Pub in Town 
Didnt try the food but the service is a 10 out of 10 The ambience is also nice rustic and there is a pleasant atmosphere Music is pretty modern
Music top Drinks flop Unfortunately Mojito doesnt taste good If you order a Calpi cocktail you get it in the size of a shot for a price of 650 Therefore only 3 stars
Such a nice bar ran by  lovely people always made feel so welcome
This is a nice Irish themed pub it does not have an Irish feel to it but the nice decoration the friendly staff and patrons more than make up for it
Extra nice place very nice owner and the crew Extra good Dunkel Weizen beer and great atmosphere What else do you need 
Good place for a beer Owner serve snacks with drinks Sadly dont accept payment by card
We like the place very much and we like that you can smoke inside but you need to do something with the smoke and ventilation Last time we couldnt breathe and because of it we didnt order the second round
This is a fun place to eat Good Food good service and a fun crowd of customers The Staff really aims to please
Good beer and a very good service
Great community but bad ventilation ashtray smell
Wonderful quaint pub with charm and good staff New people Mixed average age
Top pub super friendly landlord and large beer selection at fair prices
Every guest suits me Super Service Im always happy and try to come often
Cozy little pub good beer selection Staff who know their job best in town
Its been way too long since I was there During my studies around 8 years ago I lived in Stuttgart and went to this bar quite often Even today 8 years later I think of it sometimes The place shaped my love for Whisky good Schnitzel and an amazing atmosphere Should I visit Stuttgart again this place will be on my checklist for sure
Perfect Guinness good value for food just takes a while when its busy  service was super nice and the terrace is soo nice
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Stuttgart You are greeted with a big hello from all the staff when you walk in Fast and friendly service Plus they have an amazing Biergarten in the back
Really nice outdoor seating The food was very tasty Great place if youre not in a rush because the service was a bit slow
Nice atmosphere cool staff and great beer Will go back definitely
Awesome small pub near the walking district Small but friendly service and affordable prices make more than up for it A good pit stop in between bars
Cool spot
Great Alex the bartender was very nice 
My favourite place day and night in Stuttgart Nice ppl hang around service always friendly the ambeint with the lighting and that painting on the wall always catches me
First of all Be aware that this is a bar where you are allowed to smoke So not for everyone   Other than that  Love this bar  has a good vibe and in the summer time its nice to sit outside in the sun on the street I recommend the white wine with sparkling water Weiweinschorle 
nice club music shadowy athmosphere drinks more expensive and cash only up to 10 my drink not keyed in to cash maschine  Lots of staff no one smiles very cool
Located a stone throws away from Rathaus UBahn station this bar is underrated in my opinion as one of Stuttgarts go to places for an after work drink or coffee The interior is unique and somewhat comfortable with its massive carved bar and odd assortment of decor It is smoker friendly for the cold winter nights but be warned the music can get a bit loud on some evenings if you would prefer a quieter spot to chat
Super cozy and great atmosphere the boss is a great guy and its always fun to come there
I always enjoy going thereKazo is the best well come over soon after the treatment Greetings
Nice little pub friendly service
Nice atmosphere nice friendly service
Non smokers stay away  Run of the mill bar but super smokey I was in the place for one quick drink and feel like I smoked a 20 pack myself
Reasonable prices and friendly opening hours great environment and entertainment It would just be nice if the male staff were a bit more understanding of the girls maybe its because of the hot weather and being open all day Ill understand
Ambiance is nice but the service is awful kitchen is nonexistent and the frequentation is the opposite from nice people
Casually beet drinking bar
Typical German pub Allright but there is allowed to smoke inside so your clothes will smell like a pack of old cigarettes after your visit
Great whiskey bar Sky sports and Halloween themed interior Some would call it urig 
Sybille is love Sybille is life
Very friendly staff and fair prices The service is just great Definitely the best pub in Vaihingen
Cool bar Mixed guests from young to old Two dart machines Prices reasonable
Super good for playing darts having a drink comfortably Bus stop within walking distance nearby Otherwise a taxi will be called Service friendly And on weekends there are occasional special events such as karaoke or darts tournaments Recommended Only one point deduction because of the toilets
Cool bar really nice hosts
Been to the Phoenix for the first time and Im thrilled Cozy bar with good beer and a wide selection of spirits and cocktails Very friendly operators and friendly audience The vaulted cellar is a great location for celebrating Id love to come back
Great place a cozy bar with a gamut of drinks and a very good cuisine using fresh ingredients makes the stay worth the while Topped off by friendly staff and a lively crowd this place is a highly recommended to spend the evening with good food and lots of beer
Cosy little bar central and nice drinks selection We are mainly nonsmokers so would prefer if there were no smoking room because the smokers usually smoke outside anyways
Great food and the waitress was nice
I love this little bar The inside looks very nice and the servers are friendly Only four stars because the mixed drinks cocktails are only average But i still visit this place often
A good sport bar
Wonderful place Wonderful service Thank you
Decent place but lacking atmosphere and a weird layout
Nice ambiente and music to my taste
It was a busy rainy night everyone was inside everything was packed because of the game  so the pub was packed but we found a seat upstairs the server was very fast to take the order and the food came out quickly and considering how busy and how crowded I have to say they did a very good job  The Mojito was very good the chicken wings perfectly cooked with fresh chipsfries   great start to the evening 
We should have known when all the surrounding restaurants were full and this place had open seating on the platz The service was average at best The menu had Indian dishes that were not remotely Indian The salvage were the beer and cocktails were actually pretty good Have drinks here enjoy the platz and leave Do not eat here
As many others have mentioned its not a genuine Irish pub The location is really good and there is a TV outside to watch the football on  The signal on the TVs would constantly go out and you would need to chase down a member of staff to get it working again  First time I went we sat outside and the service was pretty attentive  the food isnt amazing but certainly not bad Pizza potentially was frozen  The staff certainly work hard  they are always on the move They do need to start actually acknowledging customers when they approach the bar to order a drink or wish to place an order for some food It only takes 5 minutes  On my second visit I sat inside and noticed people having to ask for football games to be shown on the TV I sat by the bar and tried to place an order for a beer but was ignored I asked one member of staff to place an order and was told yes I will come back He never did  I went out of my way to get someone elses attention but was told please order at the bar I then preceded to continue being ignored I left 15 minutes later without a drink and without any food and wont be coming back Go to Scholars Lounge its only round the corner and a genuine Irish Pub
It was our wonderful experience  Its a  of MunichStaff was very Friendly Food  Was Tasty and what was the  Highest Point of joyWas The Irish BeerDont Waste Time and make your nice moments Like a Nice Celebration
Kennedys Bar offers an authentic atmosphere that keeps me coming back The highlight undoubtedly is the impeccable Guinness beer they serve Its become a ritual for me to enjoy its rich flavor every time I visit The cozy ambiance complements the experience making it a goto spot for those seeking a genuine Irish pub feel
If you want to spend some time in a crowded bar where you need to shout to while talking go to Kennedys  If you wanna watch football with your friends and get excited and pour beer over each other Kennedys is a good option   BUT for a chill evening and good beer I do not recommend here the atmosphere is so live and beer doesnt have the best quality it is just normal PS Ive never eaten here so no comment on food quality
Stopped by this place to rest on a sunny afternoon There is a nice sized patio with plenty of seating Later I discovered the entire pub is underground Very cool The decor is awesome and makes you feel transported to Dublin Its a great place to spend hours I tried the apple pie as I had already had lunch It was great way better than I was expecting for a pub with the presentation being gourmet level The menu is pub food with some German classics so it has more variety than most biergartens in the city Highly recommended for a visit while youre in Munich
A nice pub with live music beautiful decoration and nice people in the center of Munich
Awesome underground bar The theme is famous scholarswriters with quotes on the walls There are so many nooks to drink in around the space even a library room The staff are great and make everyone feel welcome This is not a velvet rope and list spot Come as you are and be prepared to mingle The bar was quiet when we arrived but got rowdier as the evening went on The bar staff will take song requests and at one point all the patrons were singing along in an impromptu karaoke session This place is open until 4am and we shut it down on a Monday night I cant even imagine how fun it is on a weekendhighly recommended
Looking for an authentic Irish pub experience in Munich Look no further The barmen are from Ireland and give you the feel that youre in a pub in Dublin or the Irish countryside The entire staff was friendly and helpful Dont pass up the chance to take in a little of Ireland while in Germany
The location and the interior is great and since its a bit hidden you dont have your usual tourist around The service is nice and attentive The beer is cool and great but for me to give five stars you need to use either fresh potatoes or a different brand of frozen fries and fresh minced meat to make your burger patties instead of frozen ones In general use less convenience in the kitchen your guests will appreciate it
Lovely cosy irish pub in the heart of Munich Great place if you want to enjoy your beer with your friends or even your date On weekends its usually crowded but you might be lucky and find a table Id definitely recommend you to give it a go
Such a cozy bar to watch sports
Amazing atmosphere amazing choices of Whisky some are quite rare Explicitly Recomended for Whisky lovers
This place is a super fun and authentic Irish pub experience Try the cheddar toast
Delightful place very intimate and welcoming Its an Irish pub but unlike pubs in Ireland this one has very cozy and warm atmosphere  it feels like being invited to a friends living room Its a small place but fits plenty of good people There is live performances often totally recomended visit in this business neighbourhod
Warm and cozy atmosphere with a really nice host Had a pint of Guiness stout and a plate of the quitissential fish n chips Fish n chips was huge portion wise and plenty to go around for 2 average eaters Hand cut chips were crisp and seasoned just right Head to the pub if you want to experience a slice of the authentic pub ambience preferably in the evening after 8pm Will certainly visit when Iam back in Munich again Fish n chips  1690 Guiness  595
Fantastic pub we visited today as we wanted to watch a particular English Premier League football game Carol was incredibly helpful and found the soccer game for us Great drink selection and great service Really nice pub
Apparently you cant order a drink here without having a seat You cant get a seat without seemingly booking months in advance Id been trying to ring the pub all week to try and book a table for a rugby game but nobody picked up I saw lots of disappointed customers having the same problem and having to leave Whether this is a local regulation or a pub policy itd be nice to know in advance Shame really as it looks like a nice pub but I suppose Ill never find out
Very Nice Shepherds pie and excellent conversation with staff After many days of German food this is a solid spot to grab a pint and chill  Just go Fish and chips was good as well
Had a night there with WestendComedy witch was pretty much goodthe guys are funny Ill give 3 stars because of the service where beeing the only one at that time ordering both of the personal  just ignored me walking from one side of the bar to the other side of the bar acting like they work but sadly was not the case So 10 min waiting for a beerloosing seeing the half of the second part of the show where maybe 20 pers where inside and only me ordering at that time Very weak guys especially the old guy with the beard giving you les change  from what you buy Thx
Absolutely love the place Considering other karaoke places in Munich which are next to nonexistent this one steals the show Decent food options good drinks options and always an enthusiastic crowd The bar keepers are also very friendly and chill
The best customer service we found in munich a very friendly bar with helpfull staff and good prices Even though it was the rugby World Cup and very busy we were made to feel welcome and were even able to watch the boxing later after the world Cup I recommend this place to anyone travelling to Munich  also easy to find and not far from the s ban
Amazing atmosphere with delicious snacks There are standup comedies there regularly
I love this place It looks a little old and for some shabby but I love to come here Its like being back in the outback in Australia in the typically pub Service is excellent and also the food is still amazing even after all this years Good to do team nights out celebrate bachelorette or bachelor parties and just enjoy the international atmosphere
This is a nice Irish basement pub in the heart of Munich  Marienplatz area  We went on a Friday evening There was a live band playing English songs Apparently there wasnt anything Aussie about it From the menu to the photo frames and decor it was Irish throughandthrough  The quality of food cannot be reviewed as only snacks was ordered It was decent We tasted a range of drinks from Guinness Coke Weie cocktails to pitcher beers  all sehr gut  Service was great always a questionable experience in Germany Order taking and billing was smooth  Since its open till 2 AM definitely a nice option for Friday night hangouts And the atmosphere gets better with every passing hour
A great place to spend the evening in Munich They have great ribs and great atmosphere Also Thursday night is karaoke night
I got harassed in the bathroom by the waiter  I used to enjoy going there for the Pub Quiz But today I had the worst experience I ever had in any restaurantbar We were just having fun during the quiz and were doing quite well After some rounds I went to the bathroom for the first time during a quiz round and literally 2 seconds after sitting down in the stall a waiter Andi was knocking at my door and asking if I needed to take a  every round I felt really uncomfortable and just answered that its my first time tonight and why he is even asking Then he just started asking more questions like why he isnt hearing the peesound yet or why my girlfriend I have a husband went to the bathroom earlier Thats when I started feeling harassed and threatened so I asked him to leave He just screamed at me that I am cheating the pub quiz and left In the end they disqualified us from getting 2nd place and werent even open to answer our questions about the reasons for the harassment in the bathroom and about the disqualification So even after having some nice evenings even though the quiz master Hannah was already being rude to us I would not recommend this place to anyone anymore  When leaving the place after all that without causing any disturbance we still got screamed at  PS I had to censor some words because Google didnt approve the original review
Nice shop nice people just always great there Sha la la la la la Folk Pub Munich
This is the most unnecessary and annoying club in Munich with a completely disgusting clientele One star is still too many but unfortunately there are no zero stars here
The Irish Folk Pub is the right place for anyone who likes to play steel darts The people are super nice and even if youre new you get a friendly welcome In addition to the regular training sessions the tournaments are also a real highlight
Playing darts is in the foreground There are chilled drinks but really only places to play and watch no bar or anything Anyone who likes to play their darts in a relaxed atmosphere with likeminded people is in good hands here For dedicated players the club offers the opportunity to compete in the competition every Thursday Steel darts only
Really cosy place and not so busy as the Ratskeller Enjoyed a few Hefe Weibier and some snacks here Friday and Sunday evening Not a lot of seats tho so you have to be a bit lucky to get seated and in the busy hours
Nice cosy pub inside the dungeons of Rathauskeller of the gothic City Hall Very good service staff I enjoyed my Guinness As its in the cellar theres no windows but the air is far better  than elsewhere Very good air condition Ill come back
The best staff ever Spent all day here had some great food and beers but the staff were definitely the highlight Also as a vegetarian we dont always have a great choice of restaurants We didnt expect to have as many delicious options as we did here Would highly recommend
Wow A very British pubcocktail bar hidden in the city centre under the Rathaus at Marienplatz  I nice place to while away the hours  shame it only opens at 3pm
Nice and friendly
Cozy quiet Fits
Simply great
Great pub very very nice staff thumbs up and keep it up
Nice music reasonable prices hospitable waitersowner and really nice to sit outside
Great vibes good and well priced drinks and the bartender is lovely
Small but incredibly great bar You can put music if you talk to the barista and have a blast Absolutely recommend this place for anyone that wants to have a good time with a small crowd
The bartender was lovely when we needed another chair he fetched one for us
Sorry to do this sad review but I have to share the experience with other people My friends and I just had some food and beers at The Keg this evening and when we asked for the bill We were asked to pay for 18 helle beers We were shocked Our friends already paid for their 45 beers and food they had and that was correct When the rest of the bill was to be paid he said another 18 beers were drunken This was ridiculous and the guy said this must be a mistake as well He then went to ask the other staff to check and after a while another female staff member was sent to help us She asked us how many beers we would like to pay for and we told her 5 for our friend and then she still wanted to charge us for 18 beers in total Its crazy that she wanted to charge us for beers that we didnt drink In the end we said this was not honest to her and we paid the bill and left Just want to advise other people to check their bill before paying and I hope this doesnt happen to others The first staff member knew there was something wrong with the invoice but the other female staff she just didnt care I hope this will help others not to experience this situation
Great bar in the heart of Munich I went on a Saturday for drinks with a few friends Prices are great for food and drinks Great variety of beer and shots Also you can okay darts and watch all sorts of sports games  they have many TVs Overall great vibes I can really recommend stopping by for a pitcher of Tegernseer Beer 
Great place in the center of Munich to hang out with friends or go on your own Great variety of shots and beers to choose from compliment the friendly staff Specially Wembo Hes incredibly hospitable and me and my friends enjoyed his humor very much
Great for NFL games Get there early Go Chiefs
We called Harrys our Cheers cause after 1 day we met the whole family and they knew our names lol Great atmosphere Everyone was so friendly from the owners and staff to the other guests We went almost everyday we were there lol they even played our football game at 2am for us They go above and beyond And the wings and pizza were delicious too
When we were staying in Munich a few weeks ago it became our goto bar Not 2 nights are the same but the service is always the Best A very cosy bar but weve also been able to dance the night away or play darts Well never forget the amazing customers and staff we met there  and any time we are back in Munich well be sure to come back
Came to munich for Oktoberfest and stayed for Harrys great staff made you feel welcome form the moment you walk in amazing pizza and JACKIE COLA
In town for Oktoberfest and popped in to watch the Bayern v Man Utd game Everyone very friendly and Staff were great
Very good



Chill place with good beer Not to crowded The waiters seem kinda uninspired and just threw the small plates for our glas on the table like the really didnt want to be there and couldnt care The waiters didnt wear their uniform with pride But the place and beer was nice and i would recommend you to stop by for some cold beverage No place to surf and no music to feel jazzy A wooly fake flower on the table either mrlowenbrow isnt a flower person or korona grabbed a hold of his Wallet
Warning Very bad service We went in and sat down at a table No attention from any of the 78 serving for a long time Had to ask for the menu When we then wanted to order no one wanted to take the order but they just referred us to someone else After a while we went and complained to the head waiter at the entrance Instead of trying to save the situation and apologize he started questioning us and what we experienced They must find it difficult with customers who disturb and want to order It was not a nice picture we got of Lwenbru So we will definitely drink other beers in the future and will not visit their biergarten again Goodbye Lwenbru
But the Wiener Schnitzel still needs to be practiced Otherwise it was ok The service was quick But I would rather have a fresh schnitzel if I have to wait longer I probably wont come back sorry
Fantastic and typical German restaurant you cannot miss trying beers sausages and knuckle

Ory Bar in Munich is an absolute highlight I gladly rate it 5 stars  The cocktails are simply fantastic and offer an impressive variety of flavors that are a musttry  The Club Sandwich here is undoubtedly the best Ive ever had  a true culinary delight  The atmosphere at Ory Bar is surprisingly relaxed for such a highclass establishment You can still enjoy your privacy even when it gets a bit crowded  Despite the slightly higher prices Ory Bar is the best bar in Munich for me and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a great time with fantastic cocktails
When we visited this time the staff was very friendly and attentive but this has unfortunately not been the case on previous occasions The location is nice the drinks were great and we got some complimentary snacks
so this bar is wonderful bar in whole munich nice music ambience staff and people all around Delicious cocktails and delicious salads Cesar with chicken and the huge club sandwich is mega super large portion we cant classify or understand the few negative reviews at all but they are definitely and please excuse the stupid simple locals people the place is upscale here We say thank you and see you soon dear team
Superb hip bar located in the Mandarin Oriental It was pretty packed on a Tue evening so we sat at the bar They have an amazing selection on whiskies including some rare Japanese whiskies which we tried A must visit place while in Munich
One of the best Irish Pubs outside Ireland and the UK Ive spent many evenings there that turned into late nights I used to come here often when I lived closeby but now that I live in Berlin I plan my visits to Hamburg in a way to make sure I have the time to go there Guiness is always tasty and theres a great food menu as well including many vegetarian and even vegan options Super friendly staff Absolutely gorgeous interior and clean facilities
One of the best places to visit in Hamburg for some very tasty home made shepherds pie washed down with the best Guinness Ive tasted Add the friendly staff and great atmosphere and youll be wanting to come back here every day for your Guinness and proper good fix
great drinks great food the employees are amazing had a wonderful time talking to the short haired irish girl at the bar
We were a walkin of four today and we were greeted by very friendly staff straight away We all decided on the steak and whisky pie which was superb One of the best pies I had in Hamburg let alone Germany The pastry was fluffy and tasty the chips were really good too and the best thing is they got malt vinegar Drought beer is always a treat and the sticky toffee pudding we had for dessert was devine Again the staff was super friendly and joked around with us gave us great recommendations in terms of the menu and was just always there when we needed them without having to ask for them The cozy pub atmosphere just made all the better and we just felt right at home Will definitely come back and would recommend 1010
Incredible service Me and my friends went with the hope of being able to watch the South Africa vs Ireland rugby game The bouncer a literal angel found us a place even though they were fully packed Honestly the atmosphere was MAGICAL and I am really happy that we went Would recommend if you want a cold Guinness and a sport match
Was amazing Good customer service and nice ambience Its a must visit for football lovers
Great night out Good choice of various music genres Great choice of drinks Reasonable prices Me and my best friend and I had a great time Danced most of it No trouble and looked after by staff
Went to this bar on 8923 was overcharged more than twice what  we actually ordered we had five drinks were charged for 15 plus we arrived at 1545 left at 1942 so technically impossible for us to drink that amount anyway  Found out it also happened to another friend when I told him Disgraceful practice wont be going there again only found out when I checked my receipts days later as had to make an expense claim with airline when flights were cancelled
A nice Irish Pub as it should be 
Good Irish pub with a great atmosphere I rate these places in the quality of their Guinness naturally and this place didnt disappoint
Proper pub Not too big or small Good staffbeer and live music
Sports and live music Not particularly Irish Cash only
Great pub We watched a rugby game on the big screens had good food and fantastic drinks Took some time to find the entrance though Love the staff  theres no pushing around if its crowded they just patiently wait until youre settled and still you dont have to wait long for food and drinks After rugby they had some good live music So I will definitely come back 
Great price and atmosphere I was quite fill with one burger and potatoes And there was love music that was surprisingly nice
The Atmosphere is Great but this Pub  is Horrifically Expensive   450 for a little cupof watery coffee  is too much I wont Go back 
Ideal place if you want to watch football Kind enough to put France v Scotland game for us Busy for a Tuesday night Good tunes too
Absolutely amazing place Sensational vibes Just dont play the land lady at connect 4
Its such a great pub So happy that it is open again after having to move The beers are really lovely and owner and staff are really nice You always meet nice people in the Shamrock to talk to Music on Fridays is always really cool The quiz on Thursdays is good fun Cant wait to visit again
Fantastic pub good beer very friendly and welcoming owner staff and locals We were staying just round the corner last weekend and ended up in here for live music on the Friday and also Sunday after the St Pauli match  very convenient Highly recommended Mark Lorna  Jack
We had a great night with Gerry and Lindsay The pub quiz was on and there was a great atmosphere The pub quiz was well organised by Sabina who made it fun and entertaining Guinness was very good cant wait to go back again Best of luck lindsay 
Nice atmosphere and good rock music Cider Guiness Kilkenny Murphys and other irish beers Also cocktail for a fair price
Best pub in Harburg Totally worth the visit if you love Irish Beers Great Service and Great live music
Lovely pub Nice atmosphere Good pints an a decent number of whisky both Scottish and Irish The pub is mostly below ground and there is no WiFi donuts perfect for having conversations without your smartphone distracting you Love it Ill be back next time in Hamburg
I have been visiting this bar for the past 4 years and it never disappoints The live music is amazing along with the beers Guiness Kilkenny The only disadvantage is the space Sometimes the bar is full and there are no seating places On the ambience and service scale I give this bar a thumbs up
Homies be working at an Irish pub and have no clue how to pour a Guinness The pour was finished in literally 10 seconds At least go halfway and let it sit Tragic But pretty nice joint off the Reeperbahn
Was quiet had good of range of whisky
Pub is really good There are 3 dancemusic places One is outside which is like club style inside second floor is about live music inside first floor is about pop hip hop and latino
If you are a man and come here without jeans maybe you can enter the pub or not Be prepared If youre a woman you can probably come as you want Dont forget to have the police at your speed dial If you want to enjoy your evening just go to any other pub in the street youre going to have a better experience
great live music good drink prices went on a thursday and was okay astmophere probably better in the weekend
Great live music and a good vibe A little to crowded at times but we had fun here last night
Nice bar live music older crowd and lively around 11ish
Great bar in Hamburg Love bands Great atmosphere
The food was a bit oily The atmosphere and staff are super nice  friendly Good beer too 
Always a good experience The whole staff is really nice they have great beer and cider and the food is also pretty good Its a really cozy place with good music but not too loud so its a great way to spend the evening with friends
One of the most unique charming and hospitable places you can imagine  The staff and owner go to great lengths to makes sure every homecooked meal game andor pint come with a smile and unforgettable experiences  For locals and internationals alike like stepping into a different world  if you want to make memories this is your place
Great place Good selection of food and beer
Excellent pub Great beer on tap Holsten  and Hamburger Elbeperte What a wonderful time Such lovely staff Andrea was so very kind and helpful Because of Andrea we will be back again
Great little locals place great beer good music stools at the bar bliss
A really good find ideal for a quiet drink or two before getting on a late night bus We had a 3 hour gap between train and bus in our travel plan on a Sunday evening Cash only
What a great place to have a few beers The service was great the beer was good the atmosphere was brilliant I cannot recommend this place more Small and cosy  You would be mad to go anywhere else
Great place with great variety of beer and reasonable prices There are some special drinks too which I can only recommend They often stream sports events and there is the possibility to sit outside
Nice local bar no food only drinks But youre allowed to eat takeway food from the neigbours inside
Great beer Nice people Recommend

It was March 2022 when Europe opens after covid As an Asian Chinese I felt most welcome by Angie to have my Guinness Its far more comfortable than Murphys nearby  So I am back again soak in
Really nice vibe here and the bar staff are lovely You can smoke inside  they have toilets which you dont have to pay for Good selection of drinks and a fun boxing machine They normally always play sports games  you can ask for something specific to be played Ive been here a few times and have always had a great time
Very busy gets packed quickly
One of my favorite places in St Pauli
Super Drinks top Personal 
Great staff and good selection of drinks and food available and very reasonably priced as well
Rudest and not cool bar ever in Hamburg  and it worst Irish pub ever Even I would be a lepricorn they would recognise me
Lovely place nice atmosphere and quite good food
A very authentic pub where you get the true english atmosphere from the owner but also lovely beer and the best curry in town When you are inside it feels like you were sitting in a cosy living room
I had the pleasure of visiting this fine establishment last night 22032023 and had the most fantastic time because of the atmosphere the beer and of course the people And whilst I didnt try it somebody I was with had the curry and it looked and smelt to die for
Always a pleasure
Great English pub with authentic vibe They make you feel like a family You should check out live music on Thursday
Great bar lovely friendly staff and big outdoor space for when the sun is shining They have screens outdoors for the football and a great British Pie place called Cheeky Pies right next to the pub
Bartenders are super nice Drinks are good too
The pub is full of cigarette smoke As for food its a booth just outside so its probably a better option for summer if you dont mind eating on the street Also we went there at dinner time and most dishes were already sold out Its probably better for lunch
Good times findig the place since they dont have a sign outside Inside nice atmosphere and good drinks Around 12 pm the place got too crowded and we left
The price for an Aperol Spritz was advertised at 550 For us stupid tourists we were then charged 850 When asked they only said that the cards were still old Thats definitely not how it works
Great something away from the hustle and bustle of the Reperbahn Very friendly service Pleasant conversations with the owners Once again a big thank you to Shariff
Great bar Here you can meet friends and have fun The owner organizes regular events so it never gets boring There is the opportunity to play darts on site Slot machines are available Anyone who asks usually also has the opportunity to play their own music on the system or express their wishes
Best shop to start an evening in the neighborhood After the renovation the store just looks great You can enjoy your drinks in a great ambience and a great location near the Reeperbahn The owners are always up for a chat
Just a basic 4 chords bar Musically low level but entertaining
Amazing bar with live music and great bartenders The acts vary every night but the quality of service never falters Always great for meeting friends or just enjoying a night out The prices are very reasonable and the acts are always well chosen for the atmosphere
Nice place have a live music in the week and good Beer recomiendo Menphis red
Great live Musik 
Not full the lady at the balcony Always with a smile The Good old proletary bar Honest prices Just go
St pauli pub Brilliant Cheap beers and very friendly staff Worth a visit Went for a drink and spent 12hours there watching football 
I love this bar Good and authentic The music is also great
Excellent St Pauli Celtic Bar well worth a visit
Amazing service I was in the mood for whisky but not in the mood to choose I asked the bartender Lucas to pick me a whisky and he then asked me if I had eaten dinner already I thought he was wanting to see if I wanted a food menu but he was actually asking to better pair the whisky based on what I had recently eaten Was not expecting that Very knowledgeable about whisky and great service If you are in Kln stop by for some good whisky
Went here to wash down the revolting kebab we had spitting distance from the hotel and one of the few bars open last midnight this side of town on a weeknight  Met with a warm welcome spoke butchered German to each other and got Zwei Guinness bitte As we were waiting there was a stag group in there who were sat in a group of five that became ten that became fifteen and at that point the manager told them to go away  It takes some confidence to tell a clearly intoxicated group with priors to leave but the way they behaved on the way out shows just how right he was to get rid of them  Frankfurt is largely ruined by stags in small pockets much like Krakow Budapest and other European cities the best man books it with no thought or knowing where is actually good to go so they gravitate to these bars and feel like they can smash everything and fix nothing  A nice Guinness though lovely service for us and fun to see the same distaste for poorly behaved embarrassing stags abroad is pretty consistent  Would go again
The bartender didnt seem cool with a bunch of us even though the bar was pretty empty There were about 10 of us trying to grab a drink but he was super rude In the end he straight up said no to serving us I dont get why hes so against a group Maybe racist attitude
Nice little Irish pub reasonably priced but quite small It gets very busy when there is football or rugby on the screens Staff are friendly and the beer was good
I have been there for a drink since according to them 23h10 was already too late to order food  The environment is cool nice spot and bad staff It took us at least 20min so they would take our order  10min to direct us to a table and the place wasnt even crowded  It is a pity maybe I would return in the future and edit this note    Almost one year later I came back The food is ok and they improved the staff From 2 to 4 stars
Karaoke nights are very fun at this place They organise everything very well and the ambience is really nice and friendly Make sure to get your song request early as the queue fills up quickly  Also the food and the service are great I would definitely recommend anyone to check it out if you are in Cologne
I popped in to try it and got a great night in return A wide selection of cocktails local and Irish beers such as Guinness and good food It was kareoke night so the people were a but lively but it was a fun night
A real pub atmosphere Both the interior and exterior are quite spacious and well decorated The service is extremely fast Prices are average for a place like this There are also many screens to watch football matches
Superb a real pub Very good atmosphere with a gaffer of the highest caliber Not to be missed with real ale bottled on sale as well as the usual choices on draught
There is no food but you can order from the pizzeria next door and the owner and the staff are super cool
Okayish to good Guinness pleasant staff  atmosphere We liked it thanks for having us folks 
Friendly pub with good selection of drinks and cool staff 
The best maybe the only local spot to get Guinness  Irish beers They host events like trivia or bingo in English and also have live music on occasion Staff is always friendly and helpful even when theyre super packed like during SudFest I think the other reviews have pointed out dont go there if youre hungry Go there to drink 
No food bartender said they dont serve food no coffee they run out they said Sparkling water with scotch was served in the bottle no glass The snacks crisps and peanuts are brought to the table in supermarket bags no serving bowls When the next round was ordered they didnt bother to take away empty bags from the table The place is very relaxed but the service is below any expectations Would I recommend it to anyone Never
We were there during the Easter holiday The staff is very friendly but when we ask for some snacks they bring them in bags not in dish like in most of the places Maybe this is the German thing or maybe it is the policy of the Pub What i notice is that a lots of students are coming to this pub Overall it is ok but i will not come back again
The beer and cocktail selection is outstanding  The food is great and reasonably priced  Atmosphere was great although I would like them to okay more traditional Irish music Did remind me of a pub in Ireland recommended
I was positively surprised as I visited the pub First off all it is a great team which makes you feel that your evening is going to be amazing by providing a great service  There are several sorts of beer and not only dark again good people great service and nice location
Went there for a burger and I regret it I got an old bun and an over cooked patty the burger was horrible and expensive On the other hand the pub is great place if you go for a drink good people and great atmosphere So maybe eat the go p
Nice Guinness  nice Service even if unexpirienced
Great pub with a lovely atmosphere Staff are always great if Charlie is in youll get along with him
A cozy bar with great music and ambiance Surely its loud during live music but you have an amazing upstairs to sit relax and talk I tried 3 different beers  and they are just okay They are not strongtaste in the way they supposed to be also compared to other Irish pubs in the town I visited on Saturday and I felt like pub is over loaded but its okay thats how an Irish pub should be Prices are okay being located at the Center of the city Overall great experience beer could be improved
Irish pub with one of the rudest barmen Ive ever met Absolutely packed as they had live music which was really good and certainly bringing in the crowds Real shame as it seems like a nice place but the guy behind the bar didnt even have the basic concept of good manners or customer service just plain rude We didnt have more than one drink as we didnt like the lack of manners
Best Irish Pub in Town Awesome live music every Weekend Atmosphere is Always great Its a small place so it becomes full quite quick
Its a really nice cozy Irish pub hidden in a corner street Really good music and nice vibe Good enough collection of drinks to get you going but be awarethey accept only cash Other than that little inconvenience I really enjoyed the night with little exchanges with other visitors
Perfect chill pub experience Staff was friendly helpful and just generally awesome
The owner is so nice authentic and familiar Its just so welcoming here You can play darts which is a big plus and enjoy Irish beer they also have Klsch oder Cider The owner speaks English but he also understands German Theres also good music Five stars
A fantastic proper pub in the heart of town with a landlord who absolutely knows how to run his house Highly recommended if you just want to go and have a nice pint in a nice environment and not be subjected to the usual nonsense of loud music and sport on the TV Go for a drink and leave as a friend
Hi Ciaran nice to know youre still there Ive had many a fine evening at Buskers and should visit you sometime Ill try and give you a call one day PS dont have the VW camper any more Me wearing a green tie
Fantastic pub great Guinness and the biweekly Irish Music Sessions are fantastic
Nice bar with lots of tables to sit Some darts boards and a good selection of drinks
The best Irish pub in Cologne Four experienced Irish drinkers loved this place Very very friendly managerbarman If youre Irish come here
Good bar with even better service Staff were good fun and made us very welcome Id go here all the time if I lived nearby
Bester Laden ever

In the meantime the pub has been taken over by Italians with prices about the same as eg 150 for the Klsch Some guests have left  If you like coffee you can drink a good coffee relatively cheaply here a classic to make is always available Nice host with a nice crowd and cheap Klsch prices 120 The price has increased by ten cents and is now 130 This price also applies to various schnapps Korn Grner Kabnes Ouzo 
We ordered champ burger it was enough for one person We couldnt even finish the large size french fries Prices are a lil bit overpriced overall Other than that it has a nice ambiance
They could focus more on showing different sports in different corners You have to ask sometimes to watch nfl but the place has American football decorations all over the place It says online they show the game and then they only do it because you asked 3 times
If the weather is too hot def seat outside otherwise youre gonna have a great time but youre gonna feel like in a sauna
Nice staff good food Here you get Burgers wraps salads and grill meals  there is always a game to watch soccer NFL NBA
Fantastic store and tea room Very friendly and knowledgeable staff
Fantastic fresh scones and carrot cake
Top
Great selection of coffee and tea delicious sandwiches You have to try the whiskey cake in particular Both inside on comfortable sofas and on the terrace you can enjoy a whiskey or two and have nice conversations
Fresh klsch and a brilliant atmosphere A great place where everyone is made to feel welcome whether you want to throw some shapes or just sit down and relax Last but not least the wonderful staff went out of their way to reunite me with my lost property Thank you for a fun night and a lot more besides that Viva La Latina
Sorry but this club fails to have anything comfortable The music is nice given that youre a reggaton fan if not then youll be bored In addition just out of a sudden they decide youre not a fan anymore and they kick you out randomly even though you have not started anything
Predatory owners Went in and paid for 6 people to be told there is no more space in the cloak room for our jackets Immediately asked for our money back after 2 minutes and we were forcefully removed without getting our money back Would avoid
I did the line asked to go in I dont speak German I am Latin Didnt let us go in and didnt give us an explanation Terrible service wouldnt recommend any person that looks for a Latin place to go here Non welcoming Dont go there
We ended in this heavenly place by pure luck Geraald our BierMeister taught us about the different Klsch beer and showed us new varieties to add to our repertoire He also advised us on what to see and where to experience the full Cologne Experience We will be back for sure Greetings from Erika und Juanjo from Madrid
Best place to go and grab some drinks with friends Stuff is very friendly You can sit outside until 12 afterwards you must go inside since they close their outside sit area  Its one of the best places to go to in cologne
The drinks were very cheap compared to what you find in England The place was cozy the staff were all friendly shoutout to Haraald sehr nett
Nice beer and a busy location to people and car watch Surprising lack of bars where you can get draught beer and sit outside Plenty of bottle places
Open late good price drinks
The waiter was very friendly to us and the drinks tasted good too Overall I went in very satisfied and left exactly the same I recommend it to everyone
In short a really nice Irish pub It was really fun the atmosphere was really good and the music was playing too The service was very nice and the drinks were freshly tapped We played another round of darts all in all an evening that will definitely be repeated Gladly again 
Quaint pub with typical food and drinks the service is quick and friendly When the weather is good there is also a larger outdoor area where you can easily find a spot Will definitely come by again
A decent Irish pub experience The server situation is unique as you never knew who was the actual server as different people constantly came by The food was satisfactory and the beer was cold They had a quiz night on Monday while we were there The only negative is that the server stopped us and held up our Uber because she messed up the bill and we waited for her to charge us an additional 16 euro
Great place for watching sports and english premier league EPL or F1 They have around 8 TVs just on the outside and plenty more inside Limited food options for vegetarians Vege burger was just a big portobello but their sauce was great Wonderful crowd for big game The TV programs  volume is controlled by 1 big man Even when no one is watching a certain game he refuses to change
I had the Full Irish Breakfast but contrary to what is in the menu it was only one piece of toast cut in half and Meggle butter instead of Kerrygold Other than that very good
I went here with a group of friends to watch EURO 2020 finals The place was super super crowded and we enjoyed our time here till the end  We had their famous fish and chips To be honest the fish was very very soggy and I wish it was more crispier  Apart from that I think this place is amazing because it has such an amazing vibe especially on the weekends They have nice outdoor seatings by the curb side  Oh BTW they were also playing some English music and it was so good to sing along  Staffs were very friendly and even though this place was crowded we got our orders quickly without any delays  All in all Id be happy to visit you guys again 
This was a great find during a city break in Frankfurt Its set in the banking district and is definitely based on an English pub It made a refreshing change during our stay with a great range of beers and other drinks as well as an extensive menu based on English classic with some German influences too Theres plenty of seating and they show sport including premier league football During our stay we enjoyed a great English breakfast and an evening meal Both were freshly cooked and we thoroughly enjoyed them Would definitely visit again and can definitely recommend
This place is huuuuuge and super crowded on the weekends Honestly I think they need to have more staffs at this place because we really had to wait for a long time just to get our beers And then we didnt want to order another beer because of the waiting time  There were only 23 staffs serving this entire place and most of the times they were confused with our orders  The vibe is great of course with peaceful outdoor seating in their garden They have some amazing beers as well come in lot of British varieties We also tried their Fish n Chips and Cottage pie They were all great  Looking forward to atleast get my beer quickly next time
Great pub we got there quite late but there was still a great atmosphere Staff we fantastic and very friendly
Youve got the Ale and pale ale and the usual Irish drinks there great For food we tried the fish and chips and the steak and kidney pie not the best I had at a pub but not bad either The chips are great though crispy outside and soft inside above average even in UK standard If youre someone from the UK and miss the pub food and drinks then its worth a visit
Class pub in Sachsenhausen Frankfurt Class staff service and atmospheric Recommend anyone moving to Frankfurt or just visiting to give it a visit Home away from home
A typical Irish pub with the ambience We were there on a Saturday evening and it was already packed with people enjoying a match of rugby and football with a pint of Guinness One point people do smoke in here so if you are not a fan of smoking then maybe check before entering
A nice place to have a drink in the middle of the Sachsenhausen bar area in Frankfurt Outside seating is plentiful and lets you see all the people walk by
Good Irish pub serving nice Irish beers Both the Kilkenny and the OHaras were class
I was here for the world cup final I didnt realize that the pubs take reservations for busy events like this but luckily I snagged a solo bar seat which is where I wanted to be anyway Predictably the place went from empty to insanity very quickly I didnt struggle too badly to get a drink and they were reasonably priced I dont order food but it sure looked good Service was definitely moving as quickly as they possibly could This place just seems like a really cool neighborhood pub Im glad I got to watch the match here
A wonderful Irish Pub with a really local atmosphere Friendly service The cottage pie is the best Ive ever had Beers are cold and poured well Very much worth a visit Cozy in winter and brilliant summer outdoor area in summer Will definitely be returning
One of the best places to have Irish beersGuinness and also they screen a lot of football matches here as well I have been to this place multiple times and the crowdvibe never fails to impress me  They have the best Fish n Chips everrrrrr  If you visit this place do nottt forget to try this even if you are not hungryyyyyy Also they have amazing Irish cottage pie  Well the place is budget friendly no complaints but staffs keep changing every now and then some of them are rudeUnfriendly  Otherwise a veryyy good place to just chill with a beer
Amazing pub with friendly staffs and owner Great draft Magners that I have been looking for in whole of Frankfurt great draft Guiness and great apfelwein But the food is to me the real star The memory of eating the hand cut fries here will remain with me for the rest of my life Also give the battered sausages  chips as well as the fall of the bone ribs a try great stuff  I had wished that they have fried rice but really what Im wishing now is that theyre not halfway around the world from where Im living
Great place for a nice cold beer Not sure what qualifies it as an Irish pub other than selling Guinness and playing Irish music But I do like it all the same
Great international place cosy and quite big The entrance looks a bit small Live music 
Great staff Thanks for a quick appointment for a big group of people
Great food great service great pub
Food was over by 10pm Was personally wanting a party vibe but it wasnt the place Cannot complain much
There is a Beer Pong tournament every Thursday night We try to go there as often as possible its always fun  Im not the biggest fan of the burgers besides that I can just recommend this place however 
Staff is really unfriendly and scary we got threatened by one of the staff Would not recommend if you want a friendly experience
First time there was there at Pup Quiz night amazing Entertainment and experience
We regularly go here but mainly for their excellent coverage of sport Tonight they showed the rugby world cup final The staff worked their arsenal off brilliantly My only complaint is that I cant give their service a 10 star Well done to the bar staff and kitchen 
Great place Its one of our favorite places to hang out catch a match and drink The dish I recommend isnt even listed below its the Chicken Wings hot and wet damn perfect every time we order them Service is great understand its a small pub with a big following so be patient and the drinks will come Tip them well they know how to take care of you
Great place to stop for a pint of Guinness
I had a drink here I went to see the final of the Champions League Inter vs City If you want to pay separately you have to go inside the pub to pay The kitchen was closed when I order a burger at 2110 The TV screen was too small
One of the best Irish pub in Offenbach You can sit outside or enjoy the inside with a very nice Irish pub atmosphere The music was also nice You can play dart and enjoy the time with beautiful and tasty Irish beers
Its a great Irish pub with extraordinary reasonable prices and vast food portions However dont expect live music and Irish atmosphere  its still Germany But if you are looking for a Guinness in Offenbach this is your place to go
Great music and great atmosphere The bartender was very kind he let us try the beer without charging anything
Very chill place with great affordable drinks and nice staff
Happy days
A great pub youll hardly find a bar in Frankfurt with such low prices The guests are relaxed and the staff is absolutely great There is hardly a better location in Griesheim and in Frankfurt as a whole it is a top bar that is definitely worth it Whether its for a quick beer or a longer evening it can be a long weekend Toilets are also clean and there are two dart machines Overall an absolute recommendation just take a look
Cozy pub friendly service reasonable prices Had a nice evening with our dart team
Very relaxed bar for an afterwork beer or even a longer night Relaxed location attentive service very fair prices and a large selection of drinks  The only problem is that sometimes its over at 4 oclock thats not possible   Only recommended
Perfect ambience Great boss and friendly employees If you want to have a nice evening then this would be the perfect place
Boss is the best y and the waitress is fia And the Greek this top model with her hot friend
Great bar suppppertr cheap and very nice people
Very good boss and service
Solid beer bar in NeuIsenburg where smoking is also allowed Nice landlady
Meet nice people unique ambience great hosts
Cozy beer pub The landlord and landlady are great very family friendly You can also play darts there Just the right thing for a beer after work
Its always fun with Pia Ask for a beer pass if you have more than 10 beers in the evening or are there often Can also be used on multiple evenings Worth it
Wonderful stop in Frankfurt Love the atmosphere and the staff Will definitely visit next time I am in town
Good place to have a few beers in Frankfurt I liked the decoration of the bar and the atmosphere that there was I will definitely return
Fantastic local beer  Bartender nearly spit image of Chris Hemsworth  Good guy
Top Very nice  friendly authentic German pub Bartender is a true bartender Will definetly come again
The best PUB I have ever been The staff is super nice I really wanted to leave here money so they prosper Burgers are deliciously fantastic I am speachles and I want to come back I am on delegation only for four days and I dont want to test any other place I will just come back here I totally recommend this place
Half decent drinks selection can hear your friends and its open til late Unfortunately we came home reeking of smoke and had to wash EVERYTHING twice just because a couple of folk wanted a cigarette with their beer  Paying was a stressful and a scam Reciept said 51 few days later our bank account said they charged us 10 more than what the reciept said They forgot to include a 850 drink in the payment but then wouldnt accept card because it was less than 25 but it wasnt our fault they forgot it it was nice of us to be honest and say they missed it off 1st they tried to charge me 25 for the drink then said okay only 10 Like no Managed to find the cash between us They acted like aholes about it not the way we wanted our night to end
Friendly staff and great food but not a place if you are a nonsmoker or try to avoid certain creepy customers
very small little pub I was there on a Sunday afternoon  very empty chicken wings were good nice little pub for a break from the heat good prices
Great bar with very nice Guiness It feels cozy inside with friendly tentative staff They show all major sporting events and they also have a nice smoking  outdoors seating
Small but lively pub friendly staff cozy back garden
Like in the movies when you see this group of young people  in a charismatic bar that seems like a place that should be in every single town  in the world yet theres just not enough of them any more these days And you think theyre in their midtwenties And then you think this drunk group of loving people whos clothes look workingclass but they are in fact very privileged you think this group of people in the bar from that moviethey must be much older than you they look like their life has started but in fact youre their age and an adult in a good way Cheers 
Great typical Frankfurt pub with live football foosball table pinball machine and darts in the smoking room Guinness Kilkenny and other beers on tap cheap and delicious pub food like burgers or schnitzel For the full experience to there when Eintracht Frankfurt is playing Nice outside seating in the summer
Food was amazing and the service was really good great place to chill  have some food and some drinks
An amazing place to hang out with friends and colleagues near to the main train station Luckily my hotel was just next hence I got to try this place out The waiters are really kind specially the kind guy with specs he made me the most amazing pina colada evercant get enough of it will come here again for sure  Lots of love from France
This pub I specially recomend to foreign tourists becausse of great food foreigners are used to this kind of pub it has great food good service nice atmosphere mix of german and england culture This pub is in center of Frankfurt and who ever want to visit he will not regreat
My wife and I did not enjoy our meals at this place at all Let me tell you rude levels of service here and basic burgers at best Its a typical tourist trap for latenight eats and drinks but you wont be impressed with anything here at all When you order your food and it comes out at an unreasonable
Great highlight to my Frankfurt trip Great atmosphere and music Jacob is an excellent barkeep Good times
Pretty light on the culinary side but they have a World class soundtrack streaming so it all balances to a cool place to bivouac for a couple of hours 
The pub has an American countryside vibe drink is okay and the employees are nice
Guinness on tap what more needs to be said
Friendly attentive service nice guests cold beer what more could you want 
I enjoy this bar and people are very nice here and the employees and the boss are very friendly with customers and also funny with everyone
The hospitality in this pub is exceptional The service is courteous and friendly Here you are simply in good company Absolutely recommended
One of the best bars Ive ever been to The staff is really friendly the atmosphere is great and the prices are okay I can only recommend it
Lovely buzzing place with great staff
Very sweet Irish pub I dont remember much from the evening which is a good sign but our waitress Alice was amazing and I really like the atmosphere there Just the music sucks but thats not a reason for me to remove a star 
Nice Irish pub Cant judge weekends But on a regular weekday its not too crowded and it has a nice relaxing vibe Sky sports available and nice staff Prices are ok Dusseldorf standard I guess Music selection is really good
Great little pub I always appreciate a pint of Guinness and they had a lovely Jameson and elder flower drink on offer We really liked it The bartender was very friendly and kind I would definitely return
One of the greatest pubs in this city according to me There are a lot of people going through yes but its the only one where you feel a certain atmosphere coming from the people working there Funny smiling and open for small talk Beer cider  guiness is pretty good Favorite bar in town Ambiance and inside is matching the pub style
As a South African expat McLaughlins is our goto pub to meet fellow english speaking expats and for watching sports together with other Saffas  The staff are very friendly and always provide a warm welcoming and safe atmosphere They broadcast various popular sports including Rugby Football F1 etc and do group bookings upon request  Thank you to the staff and management for your hospitality and keep up the great work we always look forward to our next visit 
Incredibly cozy pub just make sure you say please to the bartenders All in all a beautiful potje bier
Lived in the area for about a year   Best spot if youre English speaking all the staff are friendly Ownermanager sound as best place in the city for a nice pint in the evening
I had a great time at OReillys Irish Pub The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming and the staff was friendly and attentive They have a separate room for playing darts which is awesome The food was delicious and the drinks were greatI would definitely recommend this pub to anyone looking for a fun night out
Really cozy and chill  Love the decorations You can also watch Football Match while drinking beer   wine  or Cocktails  Recommend Snakebite  Beer for the girls who doesnt like so much bitter beer  It tastes not too bitter but also a little bit sweet  But for me is really good I like it 
Staff is super super friendly and very attentive Aleks and Jack are definitely a favourite Food is gorgeous I recommend the burgers   All in all a lovely pub to hang out with friends and drink
I love this place  Absolutely the best staff really attentive and always smiling  The food is really good I usually get the wings the ribs or the fish and chips    Good value for your money  They have TV and do a quiz night and Karaoke   Not pretentious just a Pub where everyone is welcome
Nice terras to dance outdoors Waiting time at the bar was quitte long and dude though
Nice place to buy yourself a hangover
Things you have too see in life
Good ambience
The service was exceptional and the staff kept the covid19 rules stricktet how they are meant to be which lead to a save party environment
Nice
Good fish and chips nice service No credit cards accepted though
They only take cash
Is one of the best pub in  neuss Drink is good beer is good and people Are very kind
Nice place to get a beer They serve food as well We got free good bye shots Friendly service
Best company in neuss best beer Nothing more to sayl
Very friendly staff Great Guinness Comfortable seating  Good food and music And Im Irish 
One of the best pubs I have ever been to Outstanding atmosphere and great drinks
The best pub in Dusseldorf I love it
The Best Guiness in town
Absolutely unparalleled atmosphere I came in alone not speaking a lick of German and left with family
You can bring your own food How cool is that Table football dart pool and fresh apple cider is available An institution in Derendorf
The interior is super beautiful and the service very nice The drinks very good I had the feeling I was in Ireland 
I was twice already at the Suttuns Irish Pub in the Altstadt of Dsseldorf both times I had one amazing time
Called in monday night quietish great girl server looked after 5of us drinks not exspensive

Bestplace to drink with some nice music and ambience
Friendly staff and reasonable drinks  Happy hour 4 pm to 7 pm on cocktails
Reasonable Altstadt bar as part of a crawl its fine enough cant imagine why you would want to be hear too long
Good bar with very cool staff It has a nice crowd music and a lot of good drinks Good place to hang out with friends Try the Killepitsch shots
Poor service the waitress couldnt keep track of who arrived first and the gentleman who was supposed to be helping her spent most of his time looking at his mobile whilst he absent mindedly scratched the inside of his nose not good for a place that serves food Then the shift change and the service got better
Coffee 55 euro all around covered with trash Welcome
Its ok  Dont expect anyth8ng like US style sports bar as its nothing like this
Dont get the cappuccino its tiny more drink for you money if you have a Latte  Quite expensive but then it is an airport
My friends and I tried to enter the place and the security personnel did not allow us to enter while the rest of the people did for being too Spanish  We were put through a humiliating and extremely offensive situation when all my friends and I wanted was to enjoy the night
Racist behaviour We are well dressed havent sipped a drop of alcohol and we are not allowed to enter as we are not german  A shame Used to come weekly
RACIST The security guy in the grey suit outside is racist just because my friend was brown he wouldnt let us in TWICE  He wouldnt say why  and he was very rude to us  definitely go there if you support racism
The music was fun but so crowded   Could nt go inside DJ  area
A bistro with medeteranian food menu Very good good with attention to detail The lenguini was to die fortasteful mushrooms and a very well rounded taste Would go again  Good price to quality ratio aswell
One of my favorite bar in Dsseldorf Great people great music cheap bier Insane
A very basic and down to earth pub You get alt and various shots here Owner isnt the friendliest but he does his job The atmosphere is very basic but nice for a getting wasted evening
It still feels like the old timesthank God nothing has changed here
A little expensive on the one meter beer but overall vibes are really good if you are a foreigner you would love the classical German vibe My all time to go place in Dsseldorf  Mexicana shots are must try for something new and fun
First time here service is very good the female bartender is very relaxed always in a good mood and is fun to hang around with Nothing bad to say personally Everything is quick and the refill is amazingly fast Thr Altbier tastes really good Strong dark beer just how I like it I dont even want to talk about the cheap price in combination with everything else Amazing 1010
What should I say In my opinion it is one of the best pubs in Dsseldorf or even in whole of Germany The beer is always cold and at a normal price for a pub They play lots of rock The brewery for the beer they serve Krzer is right next door Definitely a must go for every sightseeing tour or just a meet up with friends
Cool pub super nice music I enjoy coming here  But be prepared for the toilets
over charged and Rubbish rude staff  We were a party of 7  a member of the party needed a chair outside because of disability which bar staff said could dowe ordered our drinks captain Morgan rum 1050  eachwhich we then found they charged us 1250 eachhaving paid the other staff came over and said we are closing and took the chair which our disabled member needed very insulting and aggressive just wanted a quick rip off of customer before closing
Horrible horrible staff very rude not intelligent and absolutely not customer oriented Today we gave this place another shot we had a table outside the waiter went out from the bar sit next to us at our table without asking and started smoking right in our faces We asked him not to do it at our table because we are nonsmokers He replied that he doesnt care and if we are nonsmokers we should go inside or leave then he turned away and continued smoking
Ive seen better DJs in worse places
Sorry guys even if the welcome was warm and promised us a good time that was no good service But let us start from the beginning We were offered a beer immediately after we entered the location and happily accept the recommendation to take a seat at the back of the pub Strange to say the first round was there just a minute later Perfect  But what happened then Basically nothing the waiter ignored us for a long time I assume not intentionally but to overlook waving customers is not that easy There are other more crowded locations where this doesnt happen After some time he brought us our beer which were empty in literally seconds you know 02l isnt that much and then again nothing We decided to leave the pub but with a sad feeling because its a nice location which I think can really be fun Unfortunately not today not for us  We might visit it again and hope the service is better maybe they just had a bad day which can happen from time to time
The place is incredibly loud despite having no music due to the volume of the patrons Theres also smoking indoors which might be what attracts these people to the place Tables have their own little area but its tiny and you wont have enough space for your feet in a group of 3 Drinks seemed reasonably priced and good though
Nice Irish pub in the middle of the city Food was great and they have a big selection of beers and whiskeys The staff was friendly and service was fast and smooth
To be honest I never tried the food and it seemed to be busy so for food it might be amazing but for an Irish bar its missing a lot Rugby quarter finals Irl v NZ German soccer on each screen not showing on any screen and had a hop house pint 4l honestly never had a flatter pint and close to 6euro for the privilege
Cool place with amazing burgers and fishnchips Good selection of beers and whiskeys
It was a nice and chill Irish pub I visited during the summer time at night so we sat outside They provide many beer options some wine cider etc they also have burger  I didnt try the burger but I saw ut was quite big and look delicious The staffs are friendly
I would have given 4 starts for the food and friendly staff but a friend of mine had ordered A cottage pie and it was served like a soup There was little bit disappointment there Plus the kitchen was overly busy so we got our food after more then 1 hour We were told before hand about the delay still it wasnt the best experience Hence the 3 stars The food and drinks were good
The interior and the music is nice The burger is good but the meat should be twice as big considering the price I really like the Deep Fried Mars Bar dessert The staff is mixed There are people very cool and kind and people extremely rude If you have personal issues please figure them out and dont bring them to work
Nice Irish style pub Good beer and liquors funny waiters and nice looking rooms Maybe the prices are a little bit too high but if you want to try a good night place in Karli this is one of the most interesting places
Excellent Food was delicious and quick served by friendly staff Brilliant pints of Guinness as youd expect from Irish pub
Great drinks friendly staff authentic experience
Great food and portion is quite big Great atmosphere for a late dinner  supper
Nice pub in the center of Leipzig Food is average and the service is always nice Little dog as bars mascotte always walking around  
Wonderful place to eat got our party of 12 in no problem Food and drinks were wonderful bilingual servers who offer suggestions Reasonably priced Dartboard and Fuball table downstairs
We went there for a beer  ordered some potatoes with cheese  both beer and potatoes were delicious Staff is very friendly and fast Pleasant experience overall will def come back
Nice place it exists in the middle between no too chic and not too casual  drink prices are standard  food prices are a bit on the high side table games available  Would recommend
Best steak i had in dubai love the irish vibes beer was good wine was good  had some beer toodefinitely  recommend
Top
Best pub in Leipzig with the best looking wait staff imaginable Even a lastminute beer while waiting for a taxi will be rewarded with a charming smile 
There is no food Most drinks were out of stock We were all very disappointed Never again You can only feel sorry for the service staff
Very nice pub A very nice atmosphere that invites you to stay longer Extremely friendly service is also present in these rooms I always enjoy coming here when Im in the area
Amazing place super nice atmosphere kind people super prices really nice placegiving advice to see  negatives lot of light and manu so far from sit and curry wurst was great but not the best  anyway the kindness and nice plays almost 5 stars from me sure u should visit 
Nice staff and great burgers and wings  We watched soccer and had a great evening with some drinks They also have a garden with tables so  plenty of space Big groups should reserve a spot 
We visited around 2300 just as the kitchen was to close The friendly staff ensured we managed to be served food good selection of beer 
This place has a huge selection of beer and drinks and the staff is super friendly and open  Theyre SUPER friendly and talkative and they also make good food
Great atmosphere close to RB Arena
Went here for a drink after the concert What can I say it didnt stop there and the next day dawned  Super friendly service Even what wasnt on the menu was mixed We also had a very nice chat with her waitress or owner Excellent Thats how hospitality worksWell be back here next time we visit Leipzig
We stopped there after an exhausting football thriller The service was super nice the service and the atmosphere are absolutely recommended Price and performance are right I would definitely like to highlight the staff again These gold pieces should definitely get a raise
Cool shop Ideal for watching football Drinks selection is very good Friendly fast and professional service We felt very comfortable Music is OK We will be happy to come back
Had a good shepherds pie here and a steak and Guinness but shepherds pie is always my favorite Great dinner for 7 Euro a plate Of course we had a couple of Guinness too Our server was very kind and attentive  We enjoyed
Best place to get a nice Irish drink and something delicious to eat Very cozy and comfortable always a pleasure to come back to The owner is a quirky cool dude and the staff is super friendly and nice You definitely need to check out this place
Nice place Really recommend their Guiness and Baileys bomb
I would highly recommend the Guinness beer and Steak and Guiness pie or shepherds pie Well be back for a 3rd time
Cozy pub with some grand Guinness
Cool pub ideal for a beer after work cozy atmosphere Delicious food
Been there again for a while and its just beautiful Thank you two Please keep it up  live music Freshly tapped Hot snacks Good beer
Very cozy pub Nice and attentive service Great music There was even live music that night great
The bar itself is awesomelike some Harry Potter English pubthe back room is for concerts or for dancinga bit small back there but so adorable and the bar is well kept
It is a classic Irish pub abroad with a nice atmosphere and a wide choice of food and drinks Very popular in Leipzig is their quiz night in English on Tue in German on Wed which makes the pub always packed so you need to get there at least 30mins before if you want to find a table and play at least for the English one Small downside waiters and waitresses are very nice but dont let 5 minutes pass without asking if you want something else to drinkeat It gets annoying in the long run
My wife father in law and I were looking for a nice place to grab a beer and walked by this place  It looked promising from the front to grab a pint  Once inside we were all shocked at the size the place is almost like a maze  Very friendly staff and great decor  The empty whiskey containers on the ceiling were pretty cool  Great spot to stop and hang out and grab a bite and a beer
Proper place for a beer  Did not try the food
Bobbys pub is an amazing place The prices are super fair The house beer is cheap and delicious and the cocktailsshots are really well made The place is really nice you can smoke inside and there is music Staff is super friendly I really recommend trying it out
Very good drinks nice beer  low prices friendly staff and great atmosphere Among the best in Leipzig
Enjoyed my couple of drinks in this fine establishment Recommended
Its a cheap dive bar great if thats what youre looking for
One of my favourite Irish bars in Leipzig Great atmosphere ambience and music selection
Beser Pub in LE
If you like rock music and beer this is probably a bar for you But you have to like it It suits Connewitz
Mexican food on the backyard Vegan nachos Amazing
Smoking bar I thought it would work but it was very dark and smelled of cold smoke We just wanted something to drink so I cant judge the food The service was very friendly
Three beers and a buck for 9  perfect
Arne S It was good Kai particularly liked it Anna W Well I thought it was great  good prices and snacks Where else can you get this for free Kai L rancid shed with rancid staff  Martin K Great value for money and fire free for smokers Live football on top This calls for a second round
100 stars for the nicest service in Leipzig Beer and sandwich taste delicious
Now we have to leave the hotel to eat at Burger King just because the waitress was not able to serve us menu card for 20 minutes then we were waiting for another 20 minutes until we left the restaurant It is not Mikes urban pub but Mikes urban shame I felt the problem is that we are foreigners due to other german guests were served quickly Western civilisations 
Great Schnitzel with fresh mushrooms and a cold beer What else do you want
Limited staff you have to wait a long time for your drinks
Ate super tasty Both my husbands burger and my Wiener Schnitzel were simply great The two waiters were also very friendly So all in all a great evening for the little stopover we made here and definitely recommended 
Super pub here you can relax with a beer and a few shots Smoking allowed like before  A special experience awaits the guest when he presses the bell at the counter This is a great place to start conversations with other guests and the landlord
Small cozy pub in the center of Sttteritz Here you can start a conversation very quickly and feel welcome as a guest The only small drawback there is nothing to eat a small snack would be nice
Very pleasant beautiful pub with great guests and nice service Ill be happy to come back Thank you
The barman is said to have died on Tuesday and was found in his apartment Now Ellys Pub will probably remain closed forever  Rest in peace Sandro
Great spot to watch some sports multiple TVs and good spots to post up
Great Ukrainian waitress Oleksandra perfect service
Grand spot for a beer and to watch football Hard to find using Google Maps Search for Marriott Hotel The bar is in the hotel
Just open again Service is ok Menus is poor Food is not goodthey must change fast or close
Had a whisky om the rocks here with some peanuts on the side and the vibes were awesome
If your daily routine break you the Beers is the best place for a beer nice positive music and atmosphere with good variety of beers and cocktails Further good prices for everyone and also the beer of the week   Also billiard football tables and drafts could be part of your activities there Very possible to could enjoy many sports events via the TV that they have
I really like Beers good drinks and billard tables makes this place fun the only really bad and uncomfortable thing is the staff they are so rude i dont know if they hate their job or they dont like foreigners sad because the place is too good for the rude staff
Good place to chill and play pool Every week theres a beer of the week wich is cheaper
Place was decent It had live music but cost 10 each head which I hadnt seen online Theres a small drink selection but what they had was nice The crowd is definitely on the older side
I dont understand the language enough to understand the lyrics but the live and was great and the food was even better Definitely worth checking out 
Great bar  club with live music Different bands different style of music Great audience and awesome team Fair prices And the foodsnacks great as well Have a look to the lineup and enjoy
My favorite bar in Leipzig awesome music nice staff and very good drinks
We were lucky to hit an evening with live music The place was packed but great atmosphere Every time again
Its a wonderfull Irish Pub Lots of traditional Ihrish Drinks and Food I Like it
Finnigans is a great place quaint the service is great and the hosts are awesome I highly recommend
Very nice and the coolest music 
The arc that can be made around the business cannot be big enough
Nice kiosk with everything you need
Super
Its a great pussy
Great food great Guinness  good pub With pool darts  And great staff practical  no waiting  time to be served pub prices are  fair If you want good service and every thing else  with it  You got to pay that penny  more
Top Pub with all the nice stuff a man needs Beside of that they have foodPool and darts to play A bit pricey when you go for the non local beverages as GuinnessNewcastle or even a 16y old Scotch but you pay even more elsewhere
Nice bar that serves delicious burgers and dark Guinness Beer The music is not too loud such that chatting with mates works quite good A recommendation
Good drinks great service Currywurst seemed a bit expensive
The best British pub in Dortmund Huge selection of gins and beers There are also many different flavors of specialty potato chips Friendly and welcoming staff They have weekly trivia nights on Tuesdays offered in English and German and will be starting regular bingo nights Sometimes they also have live music This place is a must go if you are in Dortmund
Without doubt the No1 english pub in town  The teams is fantastic authentic hosts Have never seen such selection of beer in Dortmund Come as a stranger leave as a friend
Decent pub just let down by bartender doing 1 part pours on the Guinness then 5 part pours on other glasses never seen anything like it
Nice night out with some friends Ended up here and had a blast Discovered a new cocktail and all so thumbs up
Not the best bar in Dortmond but ok for a beer seen and been to better
Biergarten that has a nice outdoor area Next to a busy street not too far from central Dortmund I went there with a group of 1215 people and owner decided to keep the place open for a bit longer than usual
Really chill place but Id rather recommend going there in summer because its more of a beergarden than a bar but if you got like smaller groups of 2 or 4 people you can go there in winter really cozy The prices are pretty good considering the current crisis going on and the staff is super friendly they even give you cocktails to go 
This is one of Dortmunds oldest bars The setting is an old gas station with a beer garden in front of it Its a great place to drink beer or cocktails The last times I have been there the service was excellent An additional plus is that you can order burgers from the place next door
Absolutely great barwith amazing service and a Foosball table to keep entertained The crowd here is awesome and the ambience quite relaxed Good music playing and a great selection of spirits and beers Must try the Mexicaner shot
Extremely hostile owner very rude to us My friend is a native of Dortmund and used to come here as a student She simply wanted to take us to her old favorites Instead she ended up embarrassed simply because she was trying to order a drink for us He yelled at her slammed drinks down It was a busy night but there were 3 workers Ive never seen worse service
Excellent drinks and service
Mega
Awesome people Loved my time there
My favorite local watering hole
Uber cool infra
Very unfriendly owner
Strolled in here randomly off the street on my ownhad a great karaoke night Lovely owner and staff wicked crowd and all in all a wonderful night Highly recommend this hidden gem
Pleasantly eclectic assortment of potent potables probably not provided at the average pub after a few highballs I emerged with a truly happy dingdong  Perhaps part of what makes the place interesting in its ungermanity in a truly German city  Worth a trip
such a good place The pub is nice beers are really good and people are able to help you anytime They play rock and roll all the time Prices are good
I met this guy here and he said this is his favorite bar Hes a really cool guy
Super cool pub with some nice music and you can also have none alcoholic drinks
Just been back there after 15 years Not much has changed and thats a good thing
really nice place with cool atmosphere and cozy interesting interiors also has two fuball tableskicker and schocken dice and cups staff as well as other people were very friendly wish there was music in the other room too
Its one of my favourite pubs Absolutely informal there is nothing fancy about this place You can get beer food and good music including small bands playing live
A wonderful pub I immediately felt comfortable The beer was delicious The service was nice the atmosphere was great And I will come again
Nice service with very good service Here you can spend a cozy evening with friends Shock cutlery available in sufficient numbers
Toilets are very small and need to be cleaned more often Mixed audience which is very pleasant Service friendly and courteous prices ok 
Nice little pub which by the way is not a gay bar Not that thats a bad thing but I think the name is a bit misleading I still like coming here There is always something going on here Bonjour from Paris with love
On Thursday night it was the only place around that was full good prices and very charming bartenders
Super Service
Fantastic little bar Loved it and made really welcome
Nice place
Best shop in town Wednesdays are LuftHansa evenings
Good prices Clean toilet Nice personel Good drinks Music too loud every now and then 
It was only there for a short time but the prices were right the atmosphere was great and the service was friendly

Nice vibes Nice food Food prices One of the best pubs in Essen
Amazing pub Came here both nights during our stay here All staff have been more than accommodating and made us feel so welcome Will definitely be back
The staff are very nice and helpful The food was ok big portions The ambient is also very unique and cool
Amazing place Seriously looks like a boat outside and inside The waiters are very friendly only one girl was confusing the orders but she was so kind to help us which it was not a problem Nice beers too 
Really nice waitersloved their servicecoktails are ok
I dont know many bars in the city center of Essen But I do like this one good ambiance and beer selection
This was the only open bar near my hotel so I decided to walk over and check it out   At first everything seemed OK but after about one hour apparently I was too old to be in the bar and was asked to leave   I bought 2 beers while I was there and was just standing and sitting off to the side watching the crowd My first age discrimination   I suppose there will be more to come but thanks Temple for being the first
The bartender was awesome good vibes all around
The best pub in the Ruhrpott is at Onkel Aris Music requests are accepted nice service and nice guests Cozy rustic pub and always a great atmosphere
If I could I would even give zero stars A friend and I walked there for half an hour at 3 am because it was the only pub still open We went in said a friendly hello put some money in the machine and a few seconds later we were sent out because we didnt order something to drink as soon as we came in When the unfriendly employee said that I even said that we had ordered something anyway and she said that we should go out and let us know for next time
Its a Schalke pub But service is okay Once you get used to the other guests you can drink your beer in peace 
Great restaurant great service very nice host Im happy to stop by on Saturdays
Authentic night bar with a wide range of music played often live There is a party room that can also be hired The service is in keeping with the tradition of the region rough but friendly Whether during the week or at the weekend you should have experienced the Sdrock in Essen
Once again you made my day Thx for inviting such bands 
One of the liviliest places in Essen Friendly stuff  nice beer and a nice rock concert the night we went there A good option to have fun at night
I went there for a concert and the event room is definitely the same as it was 50 years ago and its great to have these feelings Im thankful for these vintage vibrations
Really great atmosphere  great guests and always friendly staff
Nice pub tables in front of the door quick and friendly service
Very cozy and friendly staff I always enjoy being there again and again
The small pub is a real insider tip Gypsy schnitzel with fries and mayo for 1150 euros The gypsy sauce is homemade and not from a bucket And the freshly tapped Pils for 160 euros makes everything complete Anyone who writes here that the service is rude was probably in the wrong restaurant or drunk We were served great  The lumberjack schnitzel with lots of onions and two fried eggs is also delicious And the Veltins is also good to drink
Fun place to meet people hangout psy Boardcard games The drinks are simple and good Food is served until 11pm
I went on a Wednesday and the atmosphere was really nice there was a mix of different ages of people and a great live jazz in the background Seemed like a place for locals but as foreigners we fit in quite easily Ill definitely come again 
Great bar Music  Games  Atmosphere
By chance there was a rap group singing We had delicious noodles Sadly they dont offer more Burguers
Super Location
It is both affordable and a very nice place If you really want to have fun you should definitely visit here
You can go there without chiki Miki clothes Nice service Music is great too Something from everyone
Quite ok for a nightcap But nothing more
Nice cheerful staff great value for money A restaurant for young and old
Always worth a visit You meet old acquaintances
Cool people great service and good atmosphere Id better not say anything to the DJ  Priceperformance ratio completely ok
As always great good atmosphere  music Nice people and staff Delicious beerIts nice that the marketplace existsWe love it
Friendly Comfortable Inviting  When I return to Mlheim this amazing pub will be at the top of my list to visit again  Oi Cash only Dont be me and come up short
Sometimes you want to go  Where everybody knows your name  And theyre always glad you came  You want to be where you can see  Our troubles are all the same  You want to be where everybody knows your name
Just a pub with musik
Epic
We were here for a concert by Mr Hurley and the Powder Monkeys To look at it soberly it was just a catastrophe But its what you do with it that counts It was warm and the drinks came very very slowly The concert was stopped after 30 minutes because part of the floor in front of the stage collapsed 1 A nice email today explained all the problems 2 The band played completely unplugged in the Burg Hof Absolutely great atmosphere 3 After about 1 hour the band came to the middle of the courtyard and continued playing The party continued There was dancing and singing along It was an evening I wont forget Not because of the defects but because it was an unusual beautiful evening
beautiful surroundings in the middle of Vondern Castle There was a Kilkenny on tap and later some fries everything was nice with music and today also bingo Id love to do it again often too
Nice location  But the service is an absolute disaster You can only order at the table and you need luck to be able to order first Then you wait 20 30 40 minutesabsolute madness  The system should be urgently reconsidered  ADDENDUM The cooling system failed and there were a few other breakdowns that can just happen An email came from the organizer with an explanation and apology and selfcritical words That clearly speaks for him and thats why I adjusted the rating from 2 to 4 stars because its actually really cool here
Nice castle courtyard atmosphere delicious beers and small dishes Very nice service Top destination for weekend bike tours
Small cozy pub often very full but due to the influx of people The service is very nice and helpful There is also a covered area outside for smokers A Heizpils in winter would be nice so the audience would equalize a little
Been there for the first time in decades Since now a new tenant named Alexi is hosting it  Top super and fast service pay attention to the Corona Protection Ordinance A really small and really cozy nightcap the only one left in Kettwig Top
Spontaneously went there in the evening Quaint little pub I could almost get carried away to call it a gem of Kettwig Cozy atmosphere through narrow alleys a kind of halftimbered streetI liked it The only drawback parking was difficult because there was practically no space but I think the atmosphere and the conviviality more than made up for this negligible disadvantage  I can only recommend
Super cozy pub Great service nice guests I like to watch football here  Dear Steffi well be back Kind regards Britta and Frank from Polsum
Amazing place with live musice and great vibe Must try their burgers takes a bit long but worth the wait  Live music stops at 12  Service is good
A pub is a pub Very slow staff Had to wait for two beers like 30 min for food its OK need time to prepare Onion rings were good a nice sized portion for two persons Could do with more of the sauce
Good music  Guinness at 25 GED steep  Go local
Good music ok food a bit pricey
Best steak I ever had in my life was in this place Amazing food lovely friendly staff  and delicious drinks Besides football games 
Visited this place twice Absolutely love it Food is very tasty and the waiters nice and friendly
The prices mentioned on the menu on google are just wayy too wrong The cocktails are much costlier then what mentioned on the menu online The food is overpriced The place is okayish Dont waste money here
overpriced shabby barn A pub in which out of 4 types of beer two of them are not available there is no service in 2 hours the waiter came up to us 1 or 2 times The cocktail was made incorrectly and the price was set 2 times higher than in other places One toilet didnt work Everything is terrible I regret every lari spent in this place
Expensive spent GEL 90 for 1 person small portions long waiting time like 30 mins there could be more beer in the glass but delicious and I liked it I took a striploin steak with dark guinness cabbage salad  tartar Big hall screens with tennis   basketball translations billiard table
1010 Burger attentive waiters could hang out here to watch sports
Well lighted and open in an shopping mall with clear visibility to everything Thats just not the Irish pub atmosphre Im looking for For the rest all was fine 
Most expensive Guinness I have paid for in the world and definitely not worth it Drink was not poured correctly and was tasteless
It is the worst place We ordered chicken wings and got POISONED all 4 people Service  010We were told that food order will take 30 minutes but finally it took 1h 10mins  Phew 
Always nice an Irish pub Wasnt too crowded but very expensive beers
Lol They deleted my review So here it is again The place is in a low average Food was bad Drinks were wrong My friend didnt finish his burger I mean how bad can you make a burger so a person wont finish it Daiquiri was just a rum with lemon juice And they put a margarita that is not a margarita at all
Very good place with a comfortable atmosphere delicious beer and tasteful music
came visit late afternoon so i was the only barfly there barmaid here very sweet and kind and make me a good cocktail This block have quite lots of bar located but i think if you want to get drunk a bit on late afternoon this is the place for you
Great little pub  good variety of food and drinks Staff are great In all a nice place to hang out
The Pub with deep roots cozy and friendly environment The real Pub  not a regular bar Live music on weekends fresh beers and drinks sincerely perfect service The local pub which becomes your favourite place
Great beer warm atmosphere a lively welcoming place with good music love it
It is nice place service is really good Food which I ordered was also good maybe not best but for sure good I tried chicken BBQ and it was great order salad cucumber and tomato with walnuts and also was good Only fresh berry juice was not really because it was taste like a syrup and not fresh berries So overly it was nice place to have quick lunch Ps I will say  it is not really expensive place moderate Check prices and menu in the photos
Good food and good attention The have a good mix of national and international menu And the black lion beer the serve is very good
Every dish is good nice price and service
Good place if you are a fan of the Black Lion beer here in Georgia a bit more expensive than even central Tbilisi but its a high class establishment attached to a hotel Had a good conversation with the bartender while it was quiet was happy with the service
Its quiet here indeed First of all Id like to say that the atmosphere is great Decorations design all of this really really good But do not be deceived Half of the menu wasnt available The only dessert and they have lots of them listed is a cheesecake Some drinks were also missing Soup was served in a small cup The burger was cold by the time it reached me but still good One of the fries that came with the burger was either weirdly overcooked or rotten  TLDR The pub wasnt exactly a terrible experience but sad little accidents piling on top of each other make it hard to recommend this place
We order 2 Guinness and a whisky sour  The waitress  had no idea what a whisky sour was and was going to find out but never came back The guinness was watery We had to ask 3 times for the bill waited 20 minutes and they were not even busy  Paid in cash and was waiting for my change Another 10 minutes and no change and had to go up and they had not processed it I suspect they were hoping we walk away and they would have kept the change On the bill they had the nerve to charge a service fee Where was the service I complained about the service and the service fee which was 10 percent The waiter walked away Never got an answer and never got any service Unlikely to go back
Coffee is delicious tried americano and cold with ice cream  Caesar with chicken is quite tasty 3 points because the croutons were tasteless  French fries  to throw away brought cold  Every time they refuse to take an order for tea although it is on the menu
Did not have the food Service is slow and unfriendly But the music in the square is great
It was a delightful surprise to discover such a wonderful place in Batumi The atmosphere was pleasant and friendly It felt as if we were guests at a friends home rather than at a restaurant Its an excellent choice for dinner and a pleasant time I highly recommend it to everyone
Very pleasant place tasty dishes you may have a good lunch here and very good hookah  25 lari for a giant sandwich the rest took away for the supper Liked the berryorange lemonade in a jar too
After a really long and rainy day we wanted to stop in this cute place to taste local khacaphuri it was 18 gel 1 local beer kayaki 8 gel 1 cola 3 gel an another khacaphuri looks like pizza dont remember the name Total was 4950 gel  i think good price for 2 people Staff very friendly even tho lack of communication
Ok place to sit and grab a bite to eat off the main streets area I just got the caesar salad as I wasnt that hungry It was well prepared and high quality
A cool bar with nice staff They were very friendly and we had great time drinking on a street corner Will go there again when I have the chance to visit Batumi again and I dont do this normally
The vibe absolutely the best A lot of locals are chilling here Booze price is a lot better than in other places My fav place in Batumi that also has a branch on the beach and is in less than 400 meters
Really good place for a drinks with a friend Small park in front of the place and you can sit there and enjoy your drink
Very good place to have a good breakfast Delicious food and very good service It is a must visit place in Batumi
This is the best Chicken Caesar Salad Ive had in Batumi Sinori is very clean has great service fair prices great location and a delightful atmosphere Its never boring Highly recommended
I loved this bar Had such a fun night with people from all around the world Great beer and service and amazing atmosphere
One of my favorites places in Batumi Great for having lunch having dinner with friends or just having a night out  Food and drinks are great Highly recommend to try sinori a very tasty and huge pielike meal Atmosphere is great personnel is friendly and helpful Thanks a lot
The coctail and personal its amazing i bring 1 star for owner so rude
One of my favourite places in Batumi Atmosphere is great friendly stuff is extra benefit with Anris unforgettable laughter Omikos creative cocktails tasteful music and intresting people evenings will be fun and joyful  You can gain friends and memories here If in Batumi dont miss this spot
We spend 2 days in Batumi and ended there twice because it was the best bar in town Very friendly owners We had a good time
Very nice bar Free shots And all the people are nice here Love it
1010 highly recommend visiting here if you want fun Ill be back
Great cocktails The staff is super friendly and the owners really ensure the high quality
A small and quite place to get away from it all The bartender is very sweet and makes amazing cocktail This place is highly Recommend Because of the general service and nice atmosphere If you want to get away from the tourists while having an amazing drink this is the place to go  They speak English and Russian
This bar is definitely one of my favourite places here Super cozy atmosphere really delicious cocktails and very friendly staff Thank you
Great place with very friendly staff Cocktails best in town 
Best burger ever Nice atmosphere It is a must when you visit batumi
Cool
80 gel for the entry is ridiculous
Good but a bit expensive
Perfect people nice music and a lot of things Large variety of alcohol good interior and nice atmosphere 
Cool new place with a lot of homemade tinctures DJs and bright girlsowners And my black cat on a wall
 IN DEPTH REVIEW   If youre looking for a western style bar or anything that comes close to what you see in the 1st world this is your place  THE PEOPLE We were greeted like the bros n sisters that we are to our friends you get an immediate feeling of zoning in with your homies which to anyone born from 1980 and onwards is extremely important Seriously the internet generation needs the closeness   THE STAFF The staff are multilingual very friendly and generally are attentive to ones individual wants and needs me and my squad were walked through the bar had plenty of social interactions and you get a genuine feeling of friendship afterall paycheck or not you just want to feel welcomed   THE MENU One of the most baffling things about this bar is the incredibly wide variety of homemade brews when it comes to spirits 3040 As travelers may already know Georgians are famous for their 8000 year tradition of brewing wines and spirits Fun fact over 80 of the population are capable of self brewing Mind you that the brews are safe in terms of methanol and ethanol so dont feel anxious over the intergridy of the products Additional regular drinks that we all know and love are available   THE INTERIOR Small but very cozy and just enough for you to feel like youre at a nice party of 20people  PRICING For the average tourist from middle upper incomes this bar is relatively cheap Then again Georgia is expensive for Georgians so keep that in mind   THE VERDICT Perfect for anyone 45 and under very viby The music is mostly dance djs come every weekend during tourist season to rock the house come and see for yourself totally worth it 495
The only Bar in Batumi with Live DJ sets Every Day
Delicious restaurant The service was great Our waitresses English was very good The burger and pizza and local Georgian food were all great The burger took the longest so I maybe wouldnt order it if youre in a hurry When we came it wasnt busy at all Very chill place
Great place for some traditional food I had the Adjara Kadjapuri and the skin Kali and they were very nice The only thing I would change is the bread in the Kadjapuri as it didnt have any salt and lacked that taste Other than that the place is very nice and the prices are fair
Tasty food as we had vegetable BBG grilled and a pizza The service is as it feels like in whole Georgia not very happy The location atmosphere and the terasse make the restaurant work great 
Modern atmosphere with Georgian cuisine options as well Restaurant and pub are both available at different floors They have live music between 20002300 Four cheese pizza is recommended
After reading some unfavourable reviews I went in with low hopes I dont believe they were particularly accurate This restaurant delivers wonderful lowcost food the Adjarian khachapuri was tasty as was the Georgian salad The decor may use some updating but apart from that I believe its a great location to watch a sporting event and have a drink or snack
Nice pub with an Englishspeaking waiter  Its not expensive and local people frequent this place We were given cucumber accompaniment for our czacza  We especially want to appreciate the waiter with slightly longer black hair and a beard He was very friendly attentive quick and additionally spoke English A huge plus for this place
Awful experience We tried to exchange our beer because it was flat and the lady became very confrontational so we paid and left
Delicious dinner National Georgian food for normal prices There was a gift from owner  national home made vodka chacha Big dinner with barbecue meet costed 70 lari for 5 person Good atmosphere Very quick service There is a bank terminal
Dingo Bar organises a lot of activities and events every week international cuisine dinners broadcast of football matches game nights language clubs etc If you want to do something unusual in Kutaisi come here 
Close today
Noise
Very good atmosphere and bar owners
Very nice servis  And very tasty cocktails really tasty
Foood is sooo goood
Good service and drinks
super and beautiful place
vegetarian review  Great food especially recommended grilled veggies plate  price very reasonable hoegardem beer is also very light and tasty The service was very attentive The only minus  my favorite dish lobio is not on the menu  other than that one of the best foods that Ive eaten in Georgia 
Food was great but the opinions vary between people I was with Waiter was nice and friendly but he was speaking quietly and music was really loud which was making him hard to understand Atmosphere was kinda ruined by the loud music  tho I really liked the songs Anyway those are one of the best french fries I ate
Now THIS is how a pub should be Excellent bar food greasy and tasty in the right way and the right amount combined with wonderful zesty beer Amazing does not even begin to describe it I had some of the best potato based snacks of my life here both the home and Mexican style potatoes are a must try Mushroom with sulguni had more cheese than mushroom and that is always a good sign To go full savage try to dip your Mexican potatoes first into the buttery and cheesy mushroom pan and then into their own Mexican sauce Your arteries will hate you but every other part of your body will rejoice Must try for those in Kutaisi
Amazing interior and atmosphere Kutaisian hospitality and temperament at its best Everyone in the staff has an incredible vibe and highlevel skills  Food was delicious and that low price for that quality is just incredible and unbelievable I would say the same about the beer The founder of this pub clearly has good taste
65 if it was possible  The pub is extraordinary and it was a huge part of a lot of my parties in Innsbruck  Waiters are kind and very good service is excellent and the Guinness is very cheap An excellent option to meet a lot of foreign people in Innsbruck Also a special option for the Mojitos Just my favorite pub in Innsbruck Thank you Galway 
one of the best pubs in paris great location the atmosphere can get pretty busy and packed but other times its a nice spot to grab a couple beers and chat with friends food here is excellent as well the chicken strips are to die for staff are extremely friendly some nights they even have open mics they open till 5am
Nice pub with friendly staff They have a nice selection of beers spirits and wines They also serve food Happy hour is from 1600 to 2100
Authentic little pub in the heart of town nice spot to grab a couple beers watch sports and chat with friends not overly loud Pours a good pint of Guinness staff are extremely friendly Open late  till 5am
I visit this bar many times and I find the service not consistent When theyre nice the service is nice and warm but when theyre not its cold and super slow The drink and snacks are a joy by the way
The food was amazing here everthing was tasty and just the right amount of food and the waiters were extremely polite and understanding i came with a group who not all spoke french nor english and they had the patience to help them order extremely good place to eat and drink
Nice irish pub with different kind of beer and food In general good and tasty but higher prices Tables in and outside directly at the place national Friendly services and also showing soccer
Best Irish bar in nations area I do recommend this place for Irish coffee lovers
Good beer and food prices are bang on for Paris
The door was locked though according to Google  it was supposed to be open When walking away the proprietor reluctantly opened the door Upon entering I was not asked if I wanted anything so I had to tell him to pour me a beer As I drank the beer I kept thinking I would be getting a menu or at least be asked if I needed anything The waiter never said a word He played darts and drank a beer as we waited After about 15 minutes I asked if the kitchen was open and he said no We left and had dinner at another restaurant
Im glad to have this place in my neighborhood  Being very weak at French its nice to have the English option  The food has always been good especially the specials with sausage  I find the burger just a little on the small side for American tastes but Im probably being ridiculous  Service is always friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant  Sidewalk seating is as good as the weather  I wish theyd serve food all day every day so it could be my nobrainer option at any time
Great stop on the way to the tower
Great little place We stumbled across this place on our last night in Paris while waiting to see the Eiffel Tour light up The owner is a genuinely lovely Irish lady  Will be back Fingers crossed
I stumbled on this place by accident went in for 1 Guinness left almost 4 hours later it feel like home  Guinness from Dublin and a very respectable shelf of Irish whiskies  The staff are lovely and get a hot dog it surprised me crispy onion bits are a winner
Myself and my fianc visited this place on our first day in Paris met a lovely group of Americans there also We were in Paris celebrating our engagement and my fianc birthday The owner was absolutely lovely Looking to meet new people with a great Irish surrounding highly recommend this place
Perfect place for a foreigner to feel welcomeand watch some Rugby Service absolutely wonderful Great Irish Whiskies And the best hot dogs I have EVER tasted
We fisited this pub as one of our stops during the RWC 2023 This place is amazing Never been to a pub with better atmosphere Plenty of waiters to serve you and bring the coldest beer Wide range of beer and I even had my first Guinesse here Tried several other Irish beers The food is also  next level good Burgers chicken fries and plenty more For me the platter was the best Several diffirent meats with fries Amazing This pub is definitely worth a visit or two Well done to all staff I had a great time at your pub
Its a really good place if you wanna see a sport match football or even rugby After that I dont see it as place I would go specifically to eat Good beer and decent food We went on a Wednesday night and the place was packed with football fans watching the PSG game
Came here as we wanted somewhere to watch the rugby  and then proceeded to watch Scotland beat France which certainly enhanced the atmosphere If you like pubs youll like it here  pints at the bar and even a pool table plus screens for the sports A great place to go with friends
Wonderful Irish pub on the Grand boulevard Lots of character and lots of space inside to sit Theres also a large attractive terrace Ive not eaten here but the food I saw delivered looked good
Well tasted and very friendly The vegetarian Beyond Meat burger wich I choosed was an experiance I could give a big thump up to the Irish Man
Cool place to grab a beer and some good food alongside it 
What an awesome spot Great staff great service Some interesting beers on tap and excellent food One of the highlights of our trip Check it out
Fit out is not even close to proper Irish pub however people are making good atmosphere in the place Little bit expensive comparing with even Ireland but I found out that in all Paris pubs and restaurants paint of Guinness is similar 8 range Anyway this was good rugby watch we won with  
A cozy Bar with great vibe for beer with friends A bunch of us had a great evening here as the staff was very cordial and recommended drinks were spot on
I will never come again at this place We ordered at 2345 and the bartender didnt serve us until 0000 just to make us pay 2 more per drink The bartenders are not polite at all They made us move from place several times because we were not in the right place We ended up just leaving after 15 minutes even if we didnt even finish the drinks it ruined our night Go anywhere else literally any other bar in the zone will be better than this one
Total rip off  Has a good crowd but the staff will rip you off especially when ordering any mixed drinks  Paid 88 for four double whiskey  cokes  the bar man obviously though I wouldnt notice him only putting singles in  When I asked for the manager they asked me for my proof of ordering doubles and the bar man who had served me 2 minutes previously denied serving me at all  If your getting mixed drinks here ask the bar man to pour in front of you or youll end up getting ripped off 
Just ok the service is pretty dreadful  some staff are ok but the barmen are poor  no focus or urgency to serve people promptly There were dirty dishes all over the side counter  not a well run establishment unfortunately Several items on the menu were out including the burger  how do you let a restaurant run out of burgers
Great bar nice service yummy cocktails 
This place has best  beers tapas service is great  Ask for Maxime  he is amazing speaks English Spanish French
Will not be drinking here again 9euro a pint and they tell you its Magners when its actually Normandy French cider Taking the piss and getting away with it Better bars in Paris
Finally a good beer  We stopped for a drink and a snack and the staff was friendly and quick  The Planche Veggie hit the spot and was something new if familiar
Fearghal was our bartender He was funny and kept us entertained We popped in there for a couple of pints to get out of the cold and were glad that we did The place was empty and that made us feel calm And the restrooms downstairs were clean
Omg this place was such a sanctuary  The staff were so nice and helpful Their recommendations were excellent The fish and chips ARE SO GOOD from an Americans point of view Their burger is delicious Everything is big and worth the price Their beer on tap is excellent They have football soccer on the TVs It has a good vibe and the bathroom is clean and easy to locate the sinks have a paddle thing at the bottom you step on to turn on
Most of the staff reasonable friendly apart from one girl who should not be dealing with the public Terribly attitude unfriendly and rude even on a day when the pub was empty wednesday afternoon 11th Oct Toilets could do with a deep cleaning Food reasonably price
You come here for the nice atmosphere and the good beer The surprisingly tasty and rich nacho plate was the icing on the cake tho Prices were also fine for Paris If you look for a comfortable place in Paris to drink some pints come to Corcorans
A very cozy pub cocktails snacks and more Very good service and environment The main space in the entrance where the bar is located is much more attractive and gives you the correct feeling and pleasure Very recommended
Food is nice but the drinks are pricey even for Paris
Another great spot to sit on their outside patio and enjoy a drink or food and peoplewatch  Happy hour is from 3pm to 8pm and the drinks are reasonably priced and really good  My only reason for four stars was they closed the kitchen at 3pm for some reason and we couldnt order food  The service was excellent with most servers speaking English
We were there during our vacation for lunch The food was delicious and the service was excellent I recommend paying a visit there if youre looking for a good place to have a meal while vacationing
DO NOT GO HERE The waitstaff and bartenders are extremely rude We stayed approximately 2 hours and could only get 1 round of drinks The crowds are massive and the staff is lazy incredibly inept and unable to handle the volume
Had many a pint in this well located a Irish bar over the first weekend of RWC 2019 Great spot to watch the games the atmosphere is class and the owner is a top man
OBSESSED with this place omg the bartenders are literally my favourite ppl on earth so nice the beer is amazing best beer in paris the blonde girl can draw on guinness foam v cool the music is literally my spotify playlist like almost all of it fr also never once had to call the manager but if i did Id probably love her too note to customers order at the bar what are yall waiting for sitting at the terrace for 30mins
I give 3 stars because of the following I came on a Friday night on February around 1930h It was a good time to arrive table available while almost full Lively and international environment Service was great staff very attentive The place inside looks cozy with its vintage stuff optimal illumination not bright but not so dark and nice music choice However the only two issues that justify my rate for this comment were 1 Music too loud old speaker and pointed directly to the nearby tables which did not allow the conversation be heard well even speaking loudly So I asked the waitress to turn it down at a level that allows talking comfortably My suggestion was addressed by reducing slightly the sound but minutes later they turned it up back 2 The path between the tables and the bar is too narrow Everyone who seats there like me get disturbed by the passing by of customers and staff Some customers dont mind but others for sure do Overall the place is nice good service and prices
Authentic fish and chips is here  Great cider and lots of beer options
Brunch no recommended Only one waitress slow service  when we asked for 1 espresso and 2 lungo  She said wow you are so complicated  And Im the end she ask for tips the food was good but no the pain chocolate it was dry no fresh the place is nice  things to improve 
Top of the Range breakfast 
Accueil trs sympa Irish kitchen and beer like over there So happy

We ordered 2 beers recommended by the waiter which were really really good and some cheesy nachos again really gooood and such a big portion for 6 and tasted amazing Really nice music and vibe and people working there were really friendly and nice
Wanted to watch football and have a few nice drinks At around 11pm suddenly turned into a club which was great Drinks were priced accordingly but everything was fine
Genuinely so much fun Friends and I  stumbled across this bar that then opened into a club The waitstaff and bouncers were incredibly friendly and the DJs were fire Maybe one of the most fun spontaneous bars Ive been to in Paris
Nice atmosphere Outside seating with quite cheap drinks But the starters werent the best with burnt nachos
Arrived at a pub that advertise that the Italy v Ireland match was on TV with 45mins to spare We ordered food and drinks and asked about the match The 2 very young staff members where clueless about the match and how to even to work the TV The food and Guinness was  was very very poor They poured the guinness like it was a normal larger and served it up to me with bubbles all over the head  The WiFi didnt even work Im Irish and I am shocked and shamed that this place is representing what an Irish pub is like It is a complete shambles run by clueless people Lastly we had to leave with 15mins to spare to find another pub to watch the match
Cozy and popular pub with good dj and nice music  Booming up to 12 am 
Nice atmosphre Great parking space Wide variety of beer 
The owner is really nice Went with colleagues for afterwork and we were the first to arrive Music was good enough to be able to discuss with people in your table
Highly recommend this local bar if you are in the area
Best pub in Levallois Good choice of beers and whiskies The burgers are good but they only serve real food at lunch You can still enjoy charcuterie and cheese in the evening
Little on small side can get quite busy Little but out of the way Good selection of beers
Super fast service and delivery of food Great food to taste and excellent pizzas  Kid friendly  Awesome English Beers on Nitro tap
Absolutely awesome chief can talk can drink can stay you after closing incredible For sure it will be my best pub for next time in Paris 
Just there for breakfast So the order was simple Orange juice croissant and espresso Out of which croissant was excellent orange juice was half water and espresso was not one of the best A smile on the face is probably on the menu as well which I forgot to order  No reaction even for my greetings
I went on my own slightly before 8pm on a week night While the waiter was a bit cold the order came in fast for both food and drink  I got myself a rumsteak with fries and a fancy icecream as dessert along a cocktail to start it all  Yhe meat was good not the finest but a clear cut above many other places I have been  All in all a nice place to eat and drink if you are in the neighbourhood
I just visited Corcorans pub while in Paris with friends last week and we had an amazing experience We were served by Calum a true Irishman who provided excellent customer service Very friendly and efficient The location is beautiful and the drinks were superb I definitely recommend this pub to anyone visiting Paris
Service was great and the bartenders were super attentive and helpful We came as part of a tour group with the primary objective to play darts but unfortunately they got rid of the machine much to the chagrin of everyone in our party The atmosphere was great otherwise
Unfortunately theres no paper menu and if you have a foreign telephone WiFi doesnt work great outside to read the menu Otherwise food is good prices are good for that location
A great place to watch sport up on the hill of Montmartre During the rugby world cup supporters brought a lot of atmosphere check out the Scottish supporters here in the video Beers are reasonably priced and the interior is quite spacious for Montmartre
Great atmosphere amazing choice of beer super friendly stuff Love it 
Nice location and space In the middle of august we could enjoy the terrace located in calm street at least during august We have order burguers and the quality is good Nevertheless a bit too expensive 19eur just the burguer  9eur a beer  in the end we spent 34eur per person for a simple meal and some drinks before Staff is very welcoming and calm Worth the experience  but price could be reviewed
Lovely beer and the lemonade with ginger is super refreshing The cheesy bacon french fries is hearty Would love to go back for more beer The down point is that the table was not very clean
A great Irish bar to watch all sports have a beer with crispy fries in an authentic space with a literary bent something for everyone English and French spoken  good service  popular during matches Close to the metro in the southeast of Paris
Staff are friendly ambiance is nice Prices are agreeable I would return
Beautiful local bistrot with home produced meat The cooking of the beef was exactly as requested  medium rare Very frendly and quick service
Lots of fun but on the Saturdaywe went the music was very koud and not my style at all And I love koud music as I like metal But this techno is not for me The beer and tapas together with the amusement were great so we stayed a good while A recommendation for socializing
Everything you can expectvin an English Pub
Toilets are the worst I have ever experienced  The smell and conditions are disgusting  The pub needs to sort this out as its a major problem  easily solved It shows that their only interest is selling drink and no consideration for the facilities of their customers
What started as a fantastic relaxed evening took an unexpected turn becoming an epic party just when we needed it most The staff were absolutely wonderful always ready for a friendly chat and they certainly knew their stuff when it came to rugb
1 depo on the plastic glasses but gave back only 20c couldnt be bothered to argue for the sake of 2 glasses but why be a scumbag about that  Otherwise the Guinness was well poured location is great and it shows the football Takes only one bad barmaid to ruin the experience
Irish pub only by name Bouncer and staff are the most unfriendly people ever Not exactly an Irish welcome As for the smell of the place stunk of dead mans feet  Walked in and was so happy to walk out Awful awful bar Craic was far from mighty
Irish people like this pub  great atmosphere fine range of beers and excellent Corsican charcuterie
Nice pub with a typical Irish atmosphere Its location close to the sea and the calanques makes it unique of its kind A bit expensive though
Beer is tasty atmosphere is lively
Awesome Irish pub especially with the navy guys singing their traditional songs which is quite beautiful
Great place to have a drink with the best prices at happy hour The view is just amazing the service is fast and the ambiance is great
Cocktails and beer and very happy and friendly bar staff It is very clean and warm Best DJ ever played the Cranberries Imagination
Vibey place from where to watch sports Affordable beer As long as you like Carlson Lager Happy hour was 1700  2100 but that might have just been because the Rugby match started at 2115
A really festive pub in a beautiful location We enjoyed a post game vibe for the Rugby World Cup The pub was well prepared and the service was good
Very friendly and helpful staff Great prices for Marseille  520 per pint of Kronenbourg We did not eat there
Nice and friendly staff Good beers
Got served beer a plastic glass My wife ordered a rum and coke that just tasted like flat coke
Great beer as expected Poor hygiene very untidy
Ras
As usual top bier
Fx
Small but awesome
Good location and atmosphere good music nice staff beautiful view Downside is that smoking is allowed in the outdoor tent so its not pleasant to sit there
Good selection of beers Service was good considering we were there on a stag do Can only give an afternoon review as we didnt stay until the evening
Great  place to visit  if you want somewhere a little l more vibrant in pointe rouge
Nice bar music is ok Theyre making strong cocktails
Menachko Rijal TAOUKIF
Correct
Crowded
Nice place good music On the other hand they advertised very good mojitos but in fact there are none And the horror everyone smokes in such a small place really horrible 
We stopped here on our walk around the Old Port and shared a pizza It was hot fresh and came out pretty quickly  We also had some PIMMs Cups since we realized it was a British Pub These were better than most of the ones you get in the UK these days because it had real sugar and not some artificial sweetener If you are looking for something other than an Aperol Spritz you should try one of these here
We were looking for some pub food and came here about 530 on a Monday we had to wait till 6pm to get food so we had a beer to wait we are dirty Americans but the staff was English friendly and helpful  The fish and chips were good not over battered and had a good flavor  They had a big patio area but we are non smokers so we ate inside  Two thumbs up
The Queen Victoria supposed to be a British bar  nothing British about it Filled with multiple Belgian beers and a few English ciders and ipa Sat down to watch the arsenal  Manchester United game the woman with the leopard print skirt walked passed us multiple times and didnt acknowledge us my partner had to ask for the menu to which she gave us attitude then took another 10mins to get someone to take our order Finally after 40mins of sitting there we get our first drinks Awful service Big credit to the lad wearing the backwards cap when he came on shift he attended to us with ease and was polite and interactive A true gent
Not a real authentic British pub but still not bad Its very expensive however in par with the rest of other local restaurants Around 18 for a main My main was good but the burger was sloppy Dessert was very tasty They sell cider and with happy hour Between 5pm and 8pm made on tap beer a great price
Very nice place DJ Frank did a wonderful job I chose a couple song and he played He made some mix  The place is very nice but the price is crazy very expensive 6 for a bottle of local Cider  Theres nice bouncer they are friendly I could get inside with cap and shorts They were very gentleman  The bar should invest in some lights for inside Like some colorful lights because inside theres no light
Two shots of Jgermeister for the modest price of 18 quite crazy
Awful They are thieves  They tried to gaslight us into thinking we hadnt paid for drinks when we had Having ordered AND paid with the waiter we went to chase up our drinks only to be told  No you need to pay Ok no problem a slight miscommunication no worries we have confirmation on our phones of the payment going through nope they didnt care the manager just shouted at us until we felt so uncomfortable we had to leave Awful experience and feel like we arent the only people they will pull this sort of act on They pray on tourists  do not go
Lunch fish and chips  Decent  Good service  Pleasant experience  Not expensive   Wine was very nice



Friendly place to meet up with friends and have a good time Top bartenders and quality service Come back earlier to enjoy the relaxed atmosphere after 930 pm expect a slightly more crowded and noisy atmosphere  You can meet up around billiards a game of darts or simply around a good beer
Impossible to put 0 too bad Avoid absolutely The service is deplorable its not at all like before We are served a charcuterie board not cut or presented and without a knife or napkin For the not fresh bread dont be in a hurry either By insisting we ended up having them but we were clearly disturbing Cocktails with water in short avoid friends
The service is pathetic it takes more than an hour before someone takes the order we had the drinks another 30 minutes later and one was missingand the fries arrived 34 of an hour then served with a ton of mayonnaise which we never asked for Fortunately the one of us group was there and made us have a good time
Apparently there has been a change of ownership because it has nothing to do with the welcome and the service and the quality The photo of the charcuterie board at 20 served raw without a knife or napkin will suffice on its own Last time for me in this place
We were there at lunch time before the RWC quarter final We had been promised food at 1pm but there was no service at all until 145pm when we could get drinks Finally the pizza chef arrived and he and his two assistants did a great job making the pizza and fries quickly serving them hot and very tasty The food ordering system is a bit archaic and required patience but it worked
Booked a table 3 weeks in advance Didnt end up getting it and they had 1 person pouring drinks so took an age Pizzas looked class tho
Took them a while to get the tvs going and ridiculous queuing system at the bar which meant you had to pay cash or queue twice as long it was very busy though Atmosphere was great
Good pub nice garden area we were there when the rugby world cup was on but I imagine when less busy it is even better
Food was quite OK but could be better compared to other restos we visited in Marseille Staff was also fine
Great food and reasonable price Really good service
Came here to have lunch as the restaurant looked quite nice and the scenery was lovely only to experience the worst level of service ever Whilst I acknowledge there was a language barrier as we were Australian and they were French which was fine but we felt that the staff aside from the girl with brown hair only catered to those who were French we almost felt as if we were being deliberately ignored because we were tourists We had to wait 20 minutes for two glasses of Coca Cola and then half an hour just to the order food as the waiters kept walking past us and serving multiple tables to the point where people who arrived much later were receiving their food and eating The wait for the food itself was also quite long and at times we had to ask the waiter when it was coming Its such a shame that this restaurant offers poor service because the food was actually very good and the scenery and atmosphere was nice also we wouldve gladly left a tip had the service been of a higher standard
Lovely place for a drink and beautiful view Also turns out to be where they filmed Love Actually  the Colin Firth proposal scene
The only thing better than their service food and music selection was their 30 taps Always delicious and always offering you a test sip you cannot miss at this place Sadly I was only ever there on Sunday and could only access their brunch menu but if their other food is half as good your tastebuds will leave satisfied
A good selection of beers and prices werent too expensive  We just had snack food but the chips and dips were fresh
Looked at reviews and thought it would be a good spot 900 pm Ordered nachos and burger Burger bun was stale flavours not great and frits were cold Nachos is just corn chips with a side of sour cream watery sauce with a loose Mexican flavour and guacamole that was very under ripe avocado Beers are expensive 89 euro for 470ml Beer was ok which saved this from a 1 star review
Amazing selection of beer the place is really big and it has also a play zone just right next door you have also great burger the service is impeccable and you can choose between staying inside our outside this is just right next to the Centre Bourse Shopping mall
Spacious place with attentive staff and too fast service The hamburgers are succulent the fishnchips are too greasy But the worst are the fries too brown and soft I would have preferred to wait 5 minutes more to have crunchy and golden fries
UPDATE FOLLOWING YOUR RESPONSE  Update I went to play with my son after 20 minutes since nothing was offered to us then I went to sit down with him again Dont lie and say we werent full because we were on a table for 2 We must recognize mistakes rather than lying And you say that we preferred to leave when you offered to help us Once we were at the door it was too late Lying is ugly know that  Obliged to give 15 because me and my wife are loyal customers of the establishment  So far nothing to say except that its been twice in a row that weve been asked to sit at the back of the restaurant alone and only been offered a drink or the menu after 10 minutes  The last time with our young child no one came to see us for 20 minutes while the waiter who seated us watched us from afar and his colleague walked past us several times  Once we got up to leave not a word of surprise from them except from a woman who came up to us to apologize for the attitude of the team  The manager a bit of a beard often at the cash register didnt even have a word while I was explaining myself in the middle of the restaurant with his colleagues  Conclusion I think that some servers are nice the typical African gentleman and lady in particular have always been on top the others careless and surely racist towards North Africans which seems to be the restaurants policy  I do not recommend and will not recommend it again  And there is no need to pretend not to understand to seem surprised or to make people believe that there is a misunderstanding
When I entered I didnt think that the place was going to be suitable for children the waiter kindly offered us to sit next to the games room it was perfect Very decent meal everything was good And the icing on the cake the childrens menus were offered we didnt know it That is the demand of the people An addition that is ultimately not too expensive Good place we will come back
Very friendly and smiling welcome from the entire team Menu with choice for all tastes Service however quite long more than 45 minutes of waiting we had to ask the waitress where our order was because we had to return to work but the taste of my dish made up for this little hiccup Correct price Very good discovery
Good Irish pub Service quite fast 115Eu a pint of Guinness and apple juice Guinness spilled in a professional way but a little bit acid maybe there is no such demand and the barrel is some days old
Best burger in my life Highly recommend this place I tried blue cheese burger and beer
Ordered a classic burger with loaded fries Amazing and great combo of flavours Definitely top 3 burgers in my life
This place mostly serves beersciderwine etc but also does a bit of bar food Burgers mostly  Slim pickings for vegetarians be very specific about your dietary requirements otherwise you may not get what you bargained for
Lovely Irish barmaid who made us feel welcome  great experience
Awesome live music and staff is super Thank you for a great evening
Classic great Irish pub Missed the live band but even without was fun
My home sweet home The best bar in Lyon Good people good mood and a lot of fun You must visits this place 
Went here for burgers and wings as shown in the pics but was told they didnt have them  Not sure if the menu changes daily or not but was disappointed
Very nice Irish themed pub rocking on Saturday night friendly service enjoyed the Cherry Chouffe beer
Nice pub Air conditioning was amazing as it was hot out Good selection of beer Food was nice and staff friendly Good place to be
Even more touristy than your average touristy bar About 5 of the patrons speak English Arab Italian or Spanish but from my experience its mostly French people who Googled it  So they spend a lot of time and money on marketing but not much on customer service keeping the lines clean as well as the bathroom  The worst part was when I started taking pictures some goon tried to make me delete everything What are you hiding
One beer for 8 is little bit overpriced in my opinion But the beer was great and the service was fine too so 45 in overall
Terrible place Never ever again If you want to loose your time and good mood youre welcome here The place is so poorly managed that we were waiting for our order was a burger 15 hours The couple close to our table was waiting for their burgers for 2  hours There was only 1 waitress that served the whole pub poor girl she is the one who is facing all complaints of the visitors instead of manager or owner and she even went to buy bread for burgers in close supermarket because the kitchen functions poorly My comments about the kitchen are indescribable the burgers are tasteless without sauces the vegan burger contains I dont know what the kitchen itself is close to the wc and while youre watching it the doubts are coming about sanitary conditions and quality of meat So our conclusion is it would be better not to pay a bill but to leave the full amount to the waitress that was gentle and was coping with all this mess with a smile
Good pub burger was amazing freshly made Pattie which surprised me Good beer and wine selection staff friendly enough live sport outdoor area and ample room inside
Good beer very friendly owner and good atmosphere Recommended
If you are looking for traboules and find yourself thirsty this is a good pub for a quick beer The service is mechanical neither good or bad
Amazing place I go there very often Blanche and miel beer are the best
Cosy little beer bar big screen tv fun bartenders easily speak both english and spanish
The place was good but pretty expensive cocktails and drinks except for the beers during happy hour pint at 5e Service is pretty fast and we spent there a good time but nothing special for this place we were only outside and we didnt get inside We recommend this place for beer 
It was very cool night The atmosphere is already so cool and the people who work there are so nice I was alone and told one bartender that it was my birthday after some time they offered me one drink and they also drank with me We did cheers together 
Bar staff were incredible Looked after thousands of thirsty Welsh Rugby fans all weekend and kept smiling even when it was 4 deep at the bar Thoroughly recommend
A nice place to come take a drink and dance The bartender is very nice and the service is fast and accurate  The place was packed when we arrived however we were able to find a table to sit after a short time of our arrival
Great place  Had lots of food and delicious beer 
Wonderful starting point for a trip on the Thirst Street Interesting shots and good beer
I was trying to go inside catching up with my friends who were already there on Halloween The guard asked me for my ID I showed him my INSA Lyon card Im an international student I told him my friends are there but he asked instead for my nationality while searching me strangely why would someone just ask for nationality I told him Im Lebanese so he replied to me that I should call my friends what You searched me man Why couldnt I enter the bar Beside that the connection was so poor inside where my friends are I waited 20 minutes so one of them was able to reply Of course I told them to leave and we left right after Shamrock is cool Ive been there many times since last year But why such guards exist
TRASH They pretend to be an irish but but its nothing but a vulgar hidden disco with high humidity and horrendous odors inside Avoid at all costs
Fun place good music and good drinks Lots of college students especially on the week end and wild parties Smoking room in the back
Absolutely fantastic I have never seen such service so cool decorations so varied beer and so many beautiful girls in one place I love this bar Thank you Vincent for your fantastic work
Good food great beer The music is a little loud but the atmosphere makes up for it
Really good ambience food and drinks One star because of the server She told us for no reason apart from the fact that maybe she doesnt want to climb up to bring the food up that upstairs was closed when in fact it was not
I thought it would be a really nice bar to go to with my friends  went there they let me and some of my friends in but all of my male friends didnt make it Literally felt like I was able to get inside just because I was a girl We tried again with a few girls in the group and again girls were accepted as the boys were told to wait outside
I went to this bar with two friends of mine I am 21 years old and they asked me for an identity cart I didnt have it with me because i usually dont get asked  I showed pictures of my ID but they didnt let me take alcohol Dont go here please because if you seem younger  than your age they will bully you
friendly staff nice beer happy hour 5 till 8 closed Saturday lunchtime which was a surprise
Great beers great staff great music The place to be Thanks Aysen for this stunning night
Superb pub Made everyone welcome and went out of there way to make us feel welcome
Super comfy atmosphere Nice place to get a good red ale in Lyon 
Cosy antique style Irish bar with amazing live music
Very nice atmosphere and especially the staff bar man called Neil is fantastic 
Its dead an irish pub should have ambiance An uplifting and inviting spirit for those who come in it should be crowded as well I counted 7 people around midnight in total this includes the staff They all watched us trying to enjoy our drink The music is english which we could count as a pro on the other side was the selection horrifying The only thing that made the 15 minutes worth while spending in this dreadful place was the Guinness itself
Nice drinking  and good  atmosphere
The four of us went here on a number of occasions during our stay in Lyon always a good crowd of people good selection of ales lager and cider we also had a sharing platter which was excellent value
A classic pub The decoration is nice but tables are too close to each other something common in Lyons restaurants Music is a bit mainstream for my taste but ok A wide variety of beers is being served Pizza is great specially for pub I could say that many italian restaurants serve inferior pizzas than dams  Service is good and another plus is that you can communicate in proper english Pricing is very good and if you get there before 1800 prices are even better happy hour
Super friendly and great range of beers and cocktails
A great pub for sports of all sorts I wanted to watch the AFL preliminary final which they had scheduled to be open for  played on most TVs throughout the bar Others attended who wanted to watch the NRL which they gladly put onto another TV Prior to the AFL starting they had an India v Australia cricket match on The food was quite good I had the Wallace Burger
Great beer selection  Friendly English speaking staff Good hamburgers You do have to wait during peak hours but you will get service
football matches shouldnt be advertised if then the connection is not reliable we had to watch a match that was skipping every minute we couldve gone somewhere else Argentinian girl I cant remember the name but she was lovely
Very busy spot for sports events great atmosphere Staff were excellent on both visits considering how busy they were Reasonable prices too
We recently visited Bettys Bar for lunch Now I may be slightly biased as Ive known the owners for a few years But the food is fantastic the beer is delicious if you love a strong coffee youre in luck and the staff are super friendly Only issue is the toilet is a little chilly
I have been to Bettys Bar several times but only for drinks Last night I went for food for the first time and was blown away Value for money is excellent and the food was amazing The Bettys Dog was unreal bacon was super crispy Also the chips fries were top notch Highly recommend for a drink andor bite to eat
Very delicious food friendly stuff and a nice atmosphere
Well Ive visited this place Lyon France  and I enjoyed every single time
Had a great night live music good beers great people great atmosphere
A really nice pub nice selection of beers and drinks The crisps arent too pricey so thats nice I really liked the atmosphere and the decoration of the place and the library with English books on the shelves Overall Id say thats its a really nice pub and definitely recommend it Cheers
Couldnt recommend this place more Such an amazing atmosphere with such a friendly team Only authentic English pub in Lyon topped off with great beer and people
Very nice bar with an English theme reasonably priced pints compared to most other places friendly serviceno wifi
Excellent bar near the Confluence mall with good enough drink options and plenty of seating available both inside and outdoors Staff is courteous and welcoming
The atmosphere is amazing and the bartender Estelle is super nice Service was so good
Lovely bar with a great beers it can be better and drinks using the name Peaky blinders in the bar is a great bet I feel that still lacks few things like decoration and music to honor its name but is in the good way anyway Also Danna the lovely bartender make a great work Hope to comeback soon
Lovely holeinthewall place with a great bilingual FrenchEnglish bartender
Very poor quality for the welsh Beers very expensive
Wonderful service with a Charming waiter Merci
Great place great staff Shout out to Vincent for the amazing service Highly recommended
Top
One stop pub ideally located close to Saone river and historical center Nice spot when Im traveling to Lyon Cosmopolitan atmosphere without fuss Dude here we have beers ciders and fish n chips while rebuilding the world within family feel Staff is caring and coolTypical setting and good vibes Only  Highly recommend  Cheers
A casual British pub style bar with a good range of draught beers We came here to watch a rugby match on TV and the atmosphere was good
I love this place  It is a very nice bar with three floors  the ground level one the upstairs and the underground  all three very accommodating I especially like the underground floor It is very antique and comfortable with sofas and big cushy chairs Their beers Amazing Their cocktails Amazing Their planche Amazing the charcuterie is very tasty very good quality Their staff Amazing They also have hot wine which will be interesting to try I have not tried it yet I highly recommend this bar  It is one of my favourites
Classic English pub  Watch a rugby match there great experience It is a small place though  so be prepared to be crowded if its busy
Friendly staff good service and more importantly a very delicious burger  Its also very good to watch football matches Visca el barca
Best burger in town price was very decent and it was delicious Great atmosphere and best service I have ever had although we didnt get to try brunch this time Definitely recommend this place Later got to try the brunch everything was amazing on the plate
The bartender was super friendly kind and attentive He provided some recommendations on things to do and even gave me a souvenir to take home I would highly recommend this as a low key laid back place to have a drink Also good for those of us whose French is not the best
The Classroom is an excellent bar in a great location  The owner has amazing taste in music and knows how to make a an excellent espresso martini    Food quality is also amazing
Fairly UK looking pub and its a pub not a bar with a decent range of local craft beer in can  bottle along with lots of more normal beers on tap  Friendly staff opens all day which isnt common in Toulouse
First rate pub Happy hour prices are very fair Guiness is good Premier League matches on tv
Nice bar with wide variety of beers  The waiter is friendly and provides quick service 
Very nice pub good atmosphere and nice service Only thing that could be better is the size of cocktail Theyre very nice but a bit small
Had some supersized burgers and the fish and chips The fish batter had mild Indian spices added which was a bit different but really tasty Good selection of beers Would definitely go again
Great food excellent staff fabulous craicv relaxed but huge attention to details
Fantastic food and great stuff ambiance
Nice food and good service Location is basically in a car park but good location if you are staying at the golf course opposite
I dont complain about price of food when the quality is good But 6 for fries that were sitting in grease and over cooked No thank you Its a nice spot to maybe drink and hang with friends But I dont recommend having dinner there Also its a 3 story pub and I had to continuously go down stairs to put it my orders  as there was not 1 waiterwaitress on any of the other floors besides the ground floor
We called in on a Monday night they dont do food on a Monday Limited seating downstairs inside luckily the weather was good and everyone was outside there is seating upstairs which is also where the only toilet is as well Being an Irish pub they have Guinness on also Irish Red and some other less well known ales as well They run a loyalty card scheme buy 7 get 1 free given there was 5 of us we soon earned a free drink Ales were well treated and presented cost was not as much as other places so all in all not bad
Visited on a weekday a very few people were in attendance Enjoyed Guinness and blonde on the tap beer They have good options on the Beer on the tap There is no much vibe waiters are nice but could have been nicer Go there and enjoy your beer It is open till 1 in night and you can finish your beer calmly
A reasonable Irish pub on the edge of the centre of Toulouse Lots of outdoor seating and some indoor space A range of beers including your Irish favourites
OBriens pub is a good place that stays open late and their nonalcoholic beer is fresh and delicious
Dont know about food but sorry beer options available were limited
Worthy happy hour 
Need a good drink and some entertainment This is your place to go
We spent 2 great evenings watching world Cup semi finals  Ambiance created by rugby mementos and pictures around  Very attentive staff and helpful  Food good  Enjoyed meeting Trevor  Thanks
Went here for the final day of the 6 Nations and watched all the matches Although we were a little disappointed there werent more people in and the atmosphere was less than we expected we still had a great day The food was excellent and the service was great Elo was brilliant and really looked after us as did Mathieu We were hoping to meet Trevor himself but apparently he was in the Snug No worries next time Hoping to be back for the 7s in May
Trevor Brennans bar and restaurant is a credit to him and his wonderful commitment to France My Wife and I visited on a number of occasions this month and we were warmly welcomed by Trevor and his wonderful team Despite our almost non existant French we were treated with great care and respect This is a lovely place to spend an evening and the local French community have rewarded Trevor with their custom Every time we visited it seemed to be the social heart of the place Well done Trevor Makes me even more proud to be Irish
This is the best Brennans bar Ive been in so authentically Irish and great staff and ambience  Well worth looking at pics on wall if Ur rugby fan like me its like looking at someones mantlepiece pics I will be back
We have visited this place couple of timesone with friend and one our date night  Place have both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangementsinside its more of musicsports vibes which we have chosen first time with friends and outdoor which is amazing tootoo sitchit chatschilled air and calm night so can sit comfortably have long conversation sip your wine with great food They have vegetarian options also like saladscheesy loaded nachos and burger with french fries which is more than enough to make you full and worth the price approx 12 euros for huge burger plate We had nice time here 
Possibly one of the worst pubs Ive been too Walked in and the staff were just plain rude We ordered food with the barmaid and got it wrong when the food arrived took the food back to the kitchen and when the food was right the waitress gave a basic death stare  isnt my fault they got it wrong for something so simple for two people Got my food worst burger and fish and chips Burger was dry wasnt even close to medium which the waitress asked how I wanted it more well done and a bit more fish and chips I have had better in a Birds Eye box from the supermarket and the chips were all burnt Atmosphere was good with the music however the amount of cobwebs everywhere was a disgrace to the bar owner it needs a clean I never really write reviews but it was abysmal We spent 45 euro on this
I was greeted by amazing people and an amazing bartender He suggested the best Hamburger The atmosphere was nice and I like the decoration I will come again
Friendly barmaid walked us through the on tap options Will say the only downside was the cider somehow had a head but otherwise fine and great value so no complaints
Nice beerbut the pub feels more like a student haunt than a warm cosy place to meet up with your mates what a pub is truly drunk  people shouting inside and being allowed to
Not that bad a bit small for large groups The terrace is not fitted as well for many people trying to grab a drink outside  One of the oldest pub in Toulouse if not the oldest
Good Irish pub with decent screens to watch rugby Could have a better selection of Irish beers
I went on an evening when Paris and Madrid football teams were facing off TV at the bar was centre of attention Very excited crowd Surprised to find Indian whiskey AMRUT at this bar too
I love coming to the Black Lion when Im in Toulouse Its the only bar that can properly do a Vieux Carr and and Old Fashioned with grace and ease  Great pub style seating indoors and amazing outdoor terrace seating when the weather is nice Food and drinks are on point offering a mix of AngloFranco choices for guests to choose from The bar is slightly misleading to tourists that it is an Anglophone bar  its not and Ive never received English service If you dont speak French staff will middle through with you and are as helpful as possible The bar staff are also really fun and always happy to try and make cocktails Ive had in other bars which is a nice touch  I recommend for anyone in Toulouse 55
A cozy place to drink They have some nice beers on taps good cocktails and good shots We went there on a Sunday night Not the most ideal day to got to a bar and there was a quiz there which was in English I highly recommend this place which is conveniently located next to the metrotram station Palais du Justice
Bar staff were really friendly  Beer selection was good But they cannot pour a Guinness
Good pub serving a variety of beers and cider Theres a large terrace and a lot of place indoors as well The staff is friendly
Here in Toulouse it is lovely to have a real British style pub
I love this place 
Great pint great company
Good place to enjoy a beer
Loved the cozy pub atmosphere The staff is friendly and helpful Everyone spoke French and English which made ordering drinks much easier The old school hip hop music being played was a great vibe for Saturday night Not sure if its weekly but a karaoke session started later in the evening with both French and English songs being sung by patrons Its now a go to spot whenever I am in the city
Nice pub with a good choice of beers and ales Ideal to watch a match
Great british bar in the Heart of Toulouse Enjoyed watching football
Went there on a rainy night It was not crowded at all but we still loved the vibe Very English The beer was great and the service was good too Would definitely go again another time when there are more people and maybe some live music too
Ordered a 3course meal and was left waiting 45 minutes for my pudding before I went in to remind the staff despite the place not being busy The place is beautiful but the staff are always talking to each other and slowly serving the customers Their opening hours is also insane  a supposedly English pub which is closed on Saturdays and Sundays  As an Englishman I am ashamed to have this pub represent my country
If youre looking to be spoken to like a dog look no further Type of place where you worry if theyre not spitting in your drink
Tasty food and friendly service Unsurprisingly the fish and chips was good
They refuse without any alleged reason to serve anything hot after 7pm no coffee no tea no chocolate even in winter time
Stade Toulousain  Sunday Night Rugby Game    The Danu here we are to enjoy the game with all the drinks and food necessary to make it a memorable night   A few moments after we were comfortably settled the nicest waiter in the world offered to take our order for both food and drinks   Patient and helpful he took our order with a sincere smile  The drinks were served in no time on the spot while our food followed quite promptly in spite of the rush hour  We had the Cheddar burger which was delicious according to my father the Kentucky Chicken Burger was ok for my mum and as far as I am concerned I liked the generous Goat Cheese salad  Honest and correct main courses for a pub which we all know are not the place was a gastronomic dinner Dont we   Special headsup again for our waiter who kept a discrete yet professional eye on us all evening long  Thanks to all The Danu team for this casual yet cozy night Looking forward to coming back with my folks or friends for a game or a dart practice 
There is the possibility to eat a 1990 burger plate made of 4 steak hachs 600 grams of meat bacon cheese etc with side salad and potatoes and gain a free pint of beer if you manage to finish it all How can you not put 5 stars
Great tastes and Irish vibe Cant miss Spent many nights there while I lived in Toulouse Great location
The best English breakfast in Toulouse
Smelly dirty and needs to be gutted  So worn it is not fit for use Bathroom full of flies Untidy and unfriendly girl at bar
Great little bar  perfect for watching the rugby Lots of English people and French locals as well
Pints pints UK vibe and not it is in France very chill Very down to earth and near the cartier St Michel Spent many evenings there in the pastStaff were always sooo great
Grand place has a dart board and decent range of ales but weirdly not many lagers their lager was really a light ale and too hoppy but my craft beer drinking friend loved it  Lots of tvs to watch matches as well
Great snacks Haggic crisps and beer on offer here  mostly Scottish Irish and English drinks and snacks Lots of Brewdog beers on offer as well as liquors and wine and they have a huge choice of Scottish and Irish Whisky Great friendly staff also
As a Brit living in Toulouse I love this place The atmosphere is fantastic and theres a brilliant selection of whiskies and beers including several Brewdog beers which are delicious The food is really tasty too I especially recommend the cheddar sticks
First visit for me to this pub that I had been told so much about What a pleasure Superb selection of house beers and elsewhere Obviously whisky lovers will feel like its Christmas when they see their selection I found their burger tonight very tasty and the pricequality ratio is VERY excellent There were a lot of people tonight and overall atmosphere was very good Friendly staff as well Keep up the good work
Must visit Antoine is the most amazing bartender ever If you have the opportunity to be served by Antoine then guarantee you have the most fun and amazing night Yet truly try the whiskey and try the gin Be happy and enjoy
Been here two days this is by far the best bar we have been in great bar great atmosphere quality beer and food snackshelped us with a must do list for the city too  Everything you need not to be missed 
Look right Im a proper Brit like a proper geezer old school like and I walked around Toulouse all bladdy day and until I found this joint I was like bladdy hell  I was like a fish outta water a Brit abroad Look I find the sisters and bladdy hell what more do you need Broads darts and geezas everywhere you look Long live the queen am I right X
A fabulous warm welcome Best cocktails Yummy burgers  Something there for everyone  Absolutely worth a visit Ill definitely go back there on my travels And you should too 
Ive been to nearly every bar in Toulouse and this is easily the best the manager is a chief and the vibes are impeccable If you are looking for a good night go here 
Old school bar The atmosphere is greater music is classic You can have beer cocktail and shots My favorite is Monkey brain
Cool little Irish pub The beer is cheap and the service is friendly
Bartenders are awesome they dont speak much English but they were really helpful and nice The music was awesome They recommended me a place to eat and to drink some local draft beers
My favorite place to grab a beer with friends
The drinks were ok but the servers  while the place was almost empty  were extremely slow and not particularly kind An app is theoretically available to pay through QR code but was not working even to pay at the counter I had to wait about 10 minutes I wont be back
Terrible service Terrible food Terrible prices
Nice decor Gets very busy so service can be slow but staff try very hard  no blame here I wasnt in a hurry Food is pretty good for busy big pub
Merciiiii LENA SUPER SERVICE
Great pub Went here with a few work colleagues for the first time today and I was pleasantly surprised by the quick service and friendly staff will definitely return here soon
Came for desserts and we had to wait for a while until one of them placed us Outside while we wanted inside but there was no place Why not After that we had to wait again for him to clean the table which could have been quick but I guess he didnt want to as it was getting late and he was tired And then he disappeared never came back to our table to take orders We saw him and another colleague and I waved them to signal that we were ready to order and one of them waved back while going inside And he disappeared to So after 10 min waiting at our table we figured that we were never going to see them again so we left Only to find them smoking at the entrance So yeah nice late exprience I finally went to les 3 Brasseurs So should you Its basically the same thing except for staff 
Ignored by staff for 15 minutes Went to bar band ordered a beer and then ignored another15 Manager interceded 4 calamari rings were 5 euros They were unimpressive Ribs weremeaty but bland Waitress then threw out half the order instead of putting in a doggy bag said oh its too late The beer was good  1 beer 4 calamari rings and half an order of ribs 30 euros
The food is amazing  truly one of the best restaurants in Labege The waiters are nice However I would recommend lowering the volume of the music which can be at bit loud at times
Not sure what year these guys think it is 15 minimum to use a card Didnt have enough cash so had to leave Might explain why the Irish bar up the road was packed and this one had about 4 people in it
Live music reasonably priced drinks and they accept card Its a compact little spot but you should be fine finding seating
Now this is probably one of the very best pubs Ive ever been to  anywhere in the world Perfect environment friendly atmosphere and then of course Rhian in the bar Thanks for a really great evening
Cheap for Nice and great drinks The bartender Tomas is fantastic and they play good music too
Home from for anyone from Galway Kevin runs a wonderful welcoming establishment and serves a decent pint of Guinness If your in the area I highly recommend dropping in
It doesnt matter where you go in the world theres always an Irish pub Watched the France  Uruguay match Great night Poor bar man was rushed off his feet
Great little sports bar near the marina the owner runs around like a mad man serving drinks they showed the rugby Very good pub
Head bartender was amazing so kind and friendly and overall pun just had a great vibe
Went here 2 nights in a row ate tonight great food great drinks menu and the waiters are very friendly and efficient
Came here for the Sunday Roast and the F1 screening  it was pretty busy inside since Ma Nolans screens most sportsracesmatches  Amazing Sunday Roast  If youre a Brit looking for your sunday roast fix in the south of France this is a great place to have it The day we went it was roasted pork  super tasty Cant wait to try the Irish Breakfast  Good service  even though the place was busy
Great beer and lovely location Did not get 5 as service seemed slow with customers very patiently waiting to be served The staff were friendly and hard working Just needed a few more of them in the evening time to keep things moving
Great spot just looking out onto Nice port We had lunch and I had the nachos which were gluten free and my partner had the BLT both were really nice
A home away from home you could describe this place We went on two separate nights and the vibe was good Drinks are reasonably priced with good service Definitely worth a visit
This review is for the owners of The Snug and Cellar You have a lovely bar that weve enjoyed for a decade We will not be back Yesterday a staff member taught a master class in How to lose a regular Ironically it was a teachable moment I fear was lost on the young man We were accused of skipping out on the tab from our previous visit Mercifully we had paid with a card and quickly proved our innocence We received no apology for the mistake That was not the problem however An apology could not have salvaged the situation The accusation was the problem To call someone a criminalin public one had better be damn sure a crime has been committed We left the disputed amount as a tip on on what will be our final visit that is we left the cost of our business
An excellent Irish pub Lots of expats and people to talk to Great atmosphere awesome staff
Lovely pub in the middle of old Town You will meet Americans and Canadians that are very friendly that visit nice for months on end The Cobble stone pathways and shops are very nice Everything that you would expect from France
Waynes Bar is a gem that stands out for its exceptional service and vibrant events The attentive staff goes above and beyond to ensure a topnotch experience creating an inviting atmosphere for patrons The quality of service truly sets Waynes Bar apart Additionally the diverse range of events hosted adds an extra layer of excitement  from themed nights to live entertainment theres always something happening Its the goto spot for those seeking not just a drink but a memorable and lively outing Cheers to Waynes Bar for delivering a fantastic pub experience
Great atmosphere both times I visited The  live music by small local bands played the top songs of popular culture and constantly engaged the crowd Experience is loud and engaging The drink prices are extortionate however with one Jaegerbomb costing 9 Other than that and the beer soaked floor of course to be expected it is more than worth visiting this venue when in Nice or visiting the Old Town specifically
We were in Nice and having checked out of our apartment we had quite a few hours to kill  Luckily the Wimbledon mens final was on so we wanted somewhere to have a meal and sit and wait for it  I googled sports bars Nice and was surprised only a few popped up Ed  Obviously watching sport in a bar is not a big thing  Anyway Waynes in the Nice old town looked to be in a good place for us  We went an hour before and a good job  It was quite quiet so we had some food but by the time our food arrived the place was nearly full  The food was amazing and very reasonably priced  Great service got to watch the match well the first 3 sets in a great atmosphere  Im not one for going to EnglishScottishIrish bars when abroad I prefer a more local experience but on this occasion when we were already on our way home Waynes helped make the journey back a much better experience
First visit to Nice and first place we went into Kept going back as we really enjoyed it Personally I thought this was one of the more functional bars Ive visited in a long time We were mostly at the bar and the staff were great to us and remembered us for each visit Happy to celebrate party of my birthday here as it felt right at home Music was good Usually caught the warm up band but didnt really stay for the late night music  Great place in our book We hope to visit again
Australian themed pub restaurant near the Promenade Everything is decentthe beer the food the service even the atmosphere Considering the other themed places in the area are some real clunkers this is high praise There are also multiple televisions playing a variety of sports The beer is the star of the show here with a good selection of different beers to choose from
Great vibe super nice staff drinks of high quality Atmosphere in the pub is like you are out of Nice I loved it so much
Quite nice atmosphere during the rugby match but cant get the point why I was charged 1840 for two beers which cost 790 and 840 First I thought there is some deposit for those plastic cups but waiter told me otherwise Also we spend more than two hours there without getting any attention of the stuff in contrary to French people sitting next to us who were asked by waitresses regularly Maybe they just dont like foreigners I dont know
Horrible experience yesterday at this place after a waiter spilled 2 glasses of Baileys coffee cocktails on me literally Ruined my evening The 2 stars are for our lovely waitress who made sure we got everything we asked for and also that I receive a discount for the mess her colleague did It is mostly a sports bar so not my kind of place the food was very bad also tasteless except for the appetisers which were quite good and the drinks are worth it only during happy hours Little alcohol in them lots of ice and thats it Very disappointed will not come back 
Just walk pastwe should have done Beer tasted like it had been poured in to the glass through an ashtray Nice view but you can get that for free
Ive been in le phare twice this week while on a trip to nice  Ive drank her numerous times over the years when in villefanche but today I left after having encountered what i can only describe as the rudest young girl ever serving in a bar  I had 1 pint and myself and my wife left  when paying by card she asked for cash  i said I didnt have any she replied if your coming back next time bring cash i told her I wont be back and that her attitude stinks  good luck with this star employee
Been numerous times over the years but today i was astounded by attitude of girl serving  Needs  instruction on how to serve customers as she is very rude and has now lost 2 customers and im sure we are not the only ones if this is how she deals with people  Other staff have been friendly enough on all of our other visits
the hot dog was made from the cheapest bun baguette and smeared with not tasty ketchup and mustard the sausage was terrible just disgusting in taste I tried to eat the bun without it but it was also bad because of the taste of cheap ketchup
Drinks were good and service was quick nice atmosphere Food was mediocre at best and we waited  literally  75 minutes for 4 burgers It seems the kitchen is unable to keep up with the demand of their huge patio seating area  Tables around us had the same complaint Come here for a drink but do not eat here unless you dont mind waiting a long time
I Love this pub a good amount of different beers and the prices are good Especially the happy hour 17002100 is insane with very cheap prices for cocktails en special beers The vibe of this pub is very chill and everyone is enjoying their night here  The service is sometimes a little slow however i dont really mind to wait  So you will find me once a week at akathor
They stay opened late Its always a good time here Plenty of drink options and seating Upstairs gets sauna hot but the AC helps manage it better
They had a happy hour till 9pm with pints of Stella at 4 and Mojito at 5 Service was terrible Waiter was rude and inconsiderate He cleaned the table throwing all the scrums on my friends lap  Sorry for him but the singer wasnt the best we had heard We wouldnt go back to this place
Popular bar to watch sporting events very lively for the Rugby World Cup or people watch outside Good friendly atmosphere with a large range of beers Attentive bar staff and quicker to be served at your table than wait at the bar
This place is great We actually stopped here twice while on our vacation in Nice The service was friendly and the drink selection was amazing This is nice and tucked away in old Nice and made for some great people watching  Drinks were served with fresh olives and there was very little wait to get out drinks out Highly recommend spending some time here and just taking in old Nice
Popped into this bar twice during happy hour during our stay in Nice The beers were cold and reasonably priced and my wife enjoyed the 5 euro mojitos Atmosphere is great fantastic place to have a pre dinner drink and watch the world pass by the lanes adjacent
Best bistro in Nice  Food is just mind blowing delicious Our waiter was super nice and helpful  5 is not enough for this place 7 is more accurate awesome interior design 
Great live music that lured us into the bar one star for that Margarita was super expensive 14 for what it was It tasted like there is no alcohol or lime Just sugary water
Great location nothing else going for it Terrible service bar was covered in empties only older couple serving who were overloaded My wife ordered a glass of Ros wine it was like paint stripper Surely a criminal offense in this part of France Go to Waynes next door like night and day
Very rude employee who made us order something even though we had already ordered They didnt gave us coffee a very simple request from our part and demanded for we to order a drink or to leave the establishment  Do not recommend at all See the other bars around it there are better options
Absolute rudest group of servers Ive ever encountered Insisted we buy a 7 coke to use their bathroom okay so we did that Then they said only one person could use the bathroom for one drink Then they proceeded to yell at us when we asked politely if they could make an exception Totally bizarre Ive honestly never experienced such a hostile angry group of people
We ordered the XXL nachos which on the menu recommend it to be shared between 3 people but to be safe we ordered 2 so we tried them and a recommended cocktail The food quickly arrived but to our surprise it looked like a kids meal and the cocktail was in my opinion 6070 percent ice When we tried to complain we were ignored A friend of mine ordered water but got cranberry juice which we later found out they had put alcohol in Very disappointing experience will not return
We have come here twice in 3 days Fabulous cocktails and generous meals with friendly service and reasonable prices Great experience The mojitos are huge and refreshing Gabrielle was especially friendly
Cool looking bar in the old part of Nice serving American style food Unfortunately the service on the day was a bit lacking They seemed a bit understaffed for the number of patrons there On a more positive note the Mojitos were great and reasonably priced During happy hour they are only 490 Outside those hours they are 6 We shared  the Tex Mex plate between two which was quite generous
The food portion was not big the quality also was not awesome but for sure delicious food in this price range They also only had one waiter which was not enough for this very busy time  In general highly recommended
Traditional Irish pub located downtown Nantes The staff is very friendly The decorations are typically Irish and there is a wide variety of beers The food is very good too A terrace is available on sunny days
As soon as I stepped foot in this establishment I felt home Our server ziryan was kind caring and cheeky exactly what we had anticipated before embarking on our journey here Pints were scrumptious and the craic was at an all time high and we delved into a few games of snooker The toilets were so clean that when I split my pint on the floor I slurped it up instantly
Probably the best Irish pub Ive ever been to  Great selection of beer and Whiskys Bar server was extremely engaging as well  Bar top imported from Ireland and right in the middle of the city Clean and well kept  Good to see owners doing the right things Keep up the good work
Bar is pretty good but can you please put the sound on for the Japan v England game Half of Ireland here supporting Japan and the bar is playing bad music instead of the game We are all in Nantes for the rugby
Found this Peter Mccools real Irish pub food delicious service friendly and quick Speakers great for music and Rugby TV Seating inside or out Lots of lovely pictures on walls Bumped into manager Alexi So sound 
The best worst name for an Irish bar ever created probably some French person got drunk on Guinness and decided to open a bar having never been to Ireland while locked thats what Irish folks call drunk shouted Peter McCool is a cool sounding name for my bar I am certain some well informed helpful soul said sounds Scottish to me buddy but he was locked and did give two shis Thus Peter McCools was born that said it wasnt bad spot and they stuck the Rugby on outside Guinness was passable which in France is a small miracle food also OK and staff were friendly worth a visit if looking for a slice of home or the rugby
In four nights in Nantes we came here twice Its bar food but its well prepared and the staff is super friendly
Really nice staff here bar staff told us where to visit and told us which tram to get to the nantes gamenice vibe in the bar showing all the sports lots of tables outsidecant  recommend it highly enough great Guinness and cider too but the owner and staff were the nuts
Very nice pub with excellent service and outdoor tables
Staff were very friendly and professional Great fun as well
Very friendly spot on street seating good beers
Very nice bar with friendly waitersbartenders On the ground floor you can find an electronic darts game and upstairs a room with a billiards table 
Great range of beers Greag service and english speaking bartenders Watched Spingboks vs Australia the pub was very quiet and had about 2 other people watching sport Local games are probably a better vibe
Went to nantes to watch a football game stumbled across this bar It definitely made our weekend great bar Great service staff couldnt have been nice to us Super freindly place staff gave us great local tips of were to go and what to see and gave us easy directions for tram on match day thanks again and hope to see ye again
Great Irish bar Called in last night for a few beers Made very welcome by Dave and staffcant wait to return in the futureCheers Dave UTV
We had a layover while waiting for the trip back home to Sweden We found this place by pure chance Nice and relaxed place good beer and superb staff will not drop any names but it starts with  an F We had a few beers an some good laughs By the way the staff speaks english for those like me who doesnt speak french
A good Guinness  Nice staff and a lovely bar with rock music Brings back memories
Good cider and surprisingly for france very quick serving beer lol
Really large choice of tap beers and other drinks The location is perfect for group gatherings inside there is enough space as well as several tables outside for the smokes The hunger can be fed by several cold dishes with cheese ham sausages etc The toilet is clean Everything looks good but it still missing some charm
An amazing bar the staff were friendly and chatty and people from all over the world visiting plus lots of locals Great for a solo traveler

Great restaurant and service Called at almost 11pm on a Thursday evening they kindly agreed to welcome us to eat the kitchens are open until 1130pm The food is excellent Ive been out a lot lately and I havent eaten so well for quite a while there were 2 of us and there wasnt a crumb left until the salad dressing was made Im thinking of sherry vinegar delicious Our dishes were friendly as was the service A very pleasant woman who knows the job very professional and the service was impeccable Order just 1 dessert no need to ask for a 2nd spoon among other things Its the details that make the difference I wanted to congratulate the cook he had finished his work he came to our table to chat and was also very friendly I ended up offering them a drink because the place is so nice and its the people who make the place For meat and beer lovers you wont be disappointed meat maturing room and its a pub so they also serve good alcohol Personally I had a beef bourguignon and my friend a steak It was really good Surprising discovery because unfortunately a little hidden by the white square a franchise that is not worth half of it The town hall did not want them to put up signs to indicate them from the street and thats a shame I understand the negative opinions regarding the doorman who upon arriving told us that we had arrived a little quickly but we should not take this into account he is a real bouncer of the nightlife you can feel it You should know that it is very useful it is a pub bar people can easily get tipsy in this kind of place but thanks to this the place is friendly and not a bar pillar spot Firstly he was probably right to warn us and secondly you should know that there are a few travelers who hang out in St Herblain so he does his job very well if necessary He is neither racist being black himself nor unpleasant but just a bit of a bear from another culture I never took it badly and its pretty cool Thanks to Leene and Nicolas for their kindness and conviviality Place to make yourself known
Wanting to have a friendly time with colleagues the bouncer welcomed us with no friendliness and wanting to show himself superior to the customers we did not react to these comments 30 minutes later he returned to the charge once again in the same state of mind We decided to leave the place after that Very unfortunate because the place is very nice and the menu is tempting
I discovered this pub one evening by chance since then its a mustvisit whenever Im near Saint Herblain the 2 waitresses are great the music is great good menu Guaranteed atmosphere Discover and return 
The best pub in Nantes with exceedingly good Guinness and warm welcome A must
Love this bar  Great selection of beers on tap Came by on a Tuesday night and was helped by a fantastic bartender She not only was informative with the drinks but helped my father in law find a nearby accessible toilet Five star service
Very good bar with a nice ambiance
I only passed it  Looks nice from out side
Great pub with great service from Val
Great music  Hard rock metal Bartenders and people are very nice 
Staff are the best customers are friendly a very nice place to relax with a drink
It looks as if the staff prevents people from dancing within this rocknroll bar such a shame you should go somewhere else
Not a genuine Irish bar  We arrived 1230 after travelling specifically to the Black Shelter from the stadium  after the Ireland vs Tonga rugby world cup  game  The bar was advertised as being opened until 1am but the staff were unwilling to serve drinks to us and multiple other fans as they arrived despite the bar being half empty  Customers in the bar even appealed on our behalf to the bar staff to accommodate us given the fact that we walked to the Black Shelter from the stadium in Irish jerseys rather than going downtown to other Irish bars but the staff had zero genuine interested in accommodating us despite it being such a significant Irish sporting event in the area Would avoid at all costs in favour of authentic Irish bars downtown we went out of their way to ensure to welcome us
Good pub with nice food and a nice personnel
Concert Lesdeuxluxes Topissime
I phoned to make a booking for 2 people saterday night 19 45  in the restaurant good job I did as no room at 20 00 hours we were staying in a hotel near by food was very very good a good choice of food fair prices staff were very good and freindly there is a pub area as well worth a visit not many places to eat in walking distance from the hotel
Nice place to sit outside and watch people go by Friendly staff and an okay whiskey selection
This bar is small but one of the few really Irish pub I could find in Nantes Really good biers lot of whiskeys and darts to play The bartenders are OK nothing super They dont have food to serve they only bad point
The bar is very charming you can sit with your friends play board games darts the barmaids and bartenders are very friendly Cherry in top They make great Irish coffee
Every Sunday theres a group of musicians coming and playing Irish and other folk songs a hootenanny of sorts and the ambiance is simply amazing
Nice bar great quick service and an allaround friendly mood
Simpas
Nice little bar for a quick drink with friends You need to order at the bar yourself 
Good atmosphere and very tasty beer
Good irish pub with it atmosphere I wish they do happy hour 
Good pub with good selection of beers Really good service too
Nice place to chill out
Pretty common Irish style bar too noisy for me
Best bar ever  
This pub has nice terrace with view over the river They could have more pubsnacks on the menu The menucards are quite sticky to touch At night it must be a good place to be
Lovely Nice location nice people Good prices I suggest this place a lot
They dont let black people in
Amazing food and the service is incredible and very efficient
Very good restaurant The food was very good the staff was very helpful and the atmosphere was great I really recommend it
Good beer great atmosphere great vegetarian salad
Top service nickel
Excellent service friendly staff and choice of drinks Try local cider here on waiters recommendation
Very disrespectful and abusive staff I do not recommend this place Quite discriminatory  Meseros groseros abusivos y homofbicos Lugar poco recomendado
Great bar good music Recommended
You can find Guiness beer there
Thank you so much for our experience your service was very kind and friendly  your server praised my efforts at speaking French and that made my day She was also very happy to speak English which was very helpful We hope to be able to come again
We had a lovely lunch at Au Bureau My partner had one of their burgers and said it was the best burger he has had in Nantes I had the macaroni and cheese and while it was delicious I found it expensive for what it was 13 euros if memory serves But the British pub atmosphere was great our waitress was lovely and the location was topnotch as well Would dine here again
Visited Saturday 15th for lunch The staff are really happy and friendly and made us feel very welcome The burgers were delicious
Chain restaurant similar to a Fridays in the USA  Took quite a long time to get our food after ordering Its popular during lunch so this might have been an isolated incident Normal pub fare with a French twist Large burger selection
Great selection  of beer and ale not the cheapest
Great fun 
Great can and draft selection A bit pricey though
Best craft bar in Nantes
We spontaneously came across this spot and were wonderfully surprised by the food beer and service Very kind staff that accommodated us at the end of lunch time We tried all the items on the lunch menu and enjoyed everything Grateful that they accommodated us with a baby  Recommend
This place is well rated but I can not lie about my experience Maybe I had bad luck  Whatever i share my experience  I ordered three meals All of them were disgusting The choripan was cold and very old I had to throw it away The bruschetta was tasteless and fluffy The houmous was not that bad but it was not houmous  Sorry I dont recommend this place
Fantastic selection of beers and a very tasty menu that is regularly updated Super friendly service as well
Great place with a cool team of bartenders The variety of craft beers and spirits is amazing
Friendly great burgers good beer English speaking staff fun atmosphere bar you can sit at when alone
Great food and drinks best pub in Nantes
A lot of beers Good prices Interesting ambiente
Cosy bar with a large selection of beers
Irish English American beer Choices Staff non engaged while I was there  Sat outside in a warm day
This is a superb pub and unlike many others the Manager and his wife run the place like a family Really friendly Guinness and toasties Innit Heres a happy Chinese tourist after the World cup result
Home from home great pub in the middle of Montpellier If you love football alcohol and a game of darts or pool then this place is a must
Nice place next to the main church in old Montpelier Irish themed and lots of sport on the many TVs Staff friendly and speak English Nice drop of Guinness Does nice toasties too if you fancy a quick nibble
I wished they would be open every day They have lovely live music the staff is amazing the food is prepared with a lot of love as well They made some specials for us because were vegan And if you enjoy shisha they have a lot of tobacco choice as well even when its off season There is nice outdoor seating but inside its very cosy as well This place is such a wonderful surprise 
Nice little bar for a sport match the place is always cheerful and has some good tunes
Just went there on not so crowded Sundays nights Bon accueil et endroit attachant
nice atmosphere nice irish pub with several concerts very often at nights


Great pub to watch sports with a great vibe Shout out to the two bar tenders making cocktails  managing the lines perfectly and working with efficiency
On the day we were there we unfortunately could not get a burger because the book was not there but the personal was extremely friendly and offered us some French fries with our drinks The location is very nice
In the beginning I was loving it because its one of the few places in the area open on Sundays and the atmosphere looked great The cocktails were good the Caipirinha can definitely be improved But the service was just  detrimental First the menu QR code didnt work and then the waiter shows us that it was our Android phones because his iPhone did work Then we bring a picture of the gigantic menu hung at the entrance and he tells us thats the old menu without yet providing us with an updated menu And then when he brings my Caipirinha I confused it with another drink of my friends and he looks at me like very unkindly 
The barman was really friendly the tapas is actually surprisingly good satisfied with my cocktail but its too crowded so hard to have a conversation
Nice to stop there with friends and when they play music as well it is just great Not easy to access without a car but worth it as the staff is amazing I recommend to share happy times  parties and cocktails are awesome 
If you are a salsa dancer or a lover bachata you will like this place sometimes on thursday night they have free classes and after 22h its free dancing They have cocktails snacks and nonalcoholic drinks too Tramway station isnt really closer
Great pub with spacious outdoor sitting areaI loved the platter but didnt go crazy for their beer Lovely and available staff in a casual atmosphere
Now you have to pay 2 euros to dance Latino on Saturdays but the ambiance is really good and is comfortable to dance
Great little pub with table football and a pool table 390 for a pint of French beer Mtzig  cheapest we found in Montpellier
Amazing atmosphere the staff was great and there is space enough to be with large groups 
390 a pinte nice surroundings and good service What more could you want
Nice place with multiple games that u can try Sit outside its much better
Excellent choice of beers and friendly staff
Nice pub to drink a cold beer Kind staff When you are inside seems to be in UK it s absolutely a wonderfull traditional pub If you love sports there are big TV screens to watch your favourite team
Cheap drinks great service and atmosphere
Great service good mood and delicious drinks Been here a couple of times watching F1 Definitely coming back
The Beehive Fancy a cup of Joe or want to grab a drink in a little slice of a British paradise The Beehive is our favourite place for whatever time of the year we are in MPL Full of beans for a full English Bullseye Tastes as good as it looks Want a treat for the eyes Always in a mood for good food This is the place to be mouthwatering dishes every choice a delight for your taste buds Mash and pie Yummy Fish and Chips I call dibs Enjoy a dessert A palatetickling bite of the cherry every time Cheerful atmosphere superduper staff typical decoration like a home away from home and even the music puts a smile on my face This chefs kiss in MPL we already miss We will be back soon at the bees knees
They say that this place serves the best Cesar salad for a reason it is really good The fish cake salad was also phenomenal White wine was surprisingly considering the price really good as well
We had a delightful fish and chips dinner during a busy Friday happy hour The service was quick and friendly and the food was tasty We finished the meal with a portion of sticky toffee pudding that was generous enough for two Well be back
Simple but good pub grub A friend and I popped in on a whim and enjoyed our meals Cheeseburger for her and fish n chips for me The price was good and service pleasant
Lovely place crowded with good atmosphere any night of the week
Excellent Good ambience and live music
Too crowded
Good place
Nice British style pub in France Good food  big portions Great service too
I give 4 stars for the location and the interior Designfood looks good but tastes very very normal not fair for the prices High prices poor food quality For 18 a very normal and not tasty burger its to much I remember i had tried burgers from Macdonalds and they was much better than yours Sorry for being honest
Nice placegood tasty food
Top staff  Having had a resto for years I can tell its pretty unusual to have a strong company culture and service deep within the team  Well done to the team and management  Food was good and super fast  Really surprised luckily I got bounced out from the resto right in front Casa Inesa so Thanks to them  I discover this place
I just dropped into this place and decided to have a traditional French dish  chips and guacamole  But they put such care into making these I asked the server to compliment the chef  they would have been lavish in San Diego   They have a decent vin ordinaire and while the wait staff is insanely busy I felt very well attended  So out of my four nights in Montpellier I chose to go back there again  This time roasted cheese with honey and a plate of sausage  but with their additions of bread and tomatoes and cornichons and walnuts and croutons  I had a wonderful feast   I highly recommend this restaurant and I will be returning
Its ok  They serve a decent coffee here  They serve a reasonable croque monsieur as well  Service is a bit uneven though and the prime location is factored into the price   Its an ok touristy place
Only had drinks Excellent service Drinks were good
Great food and drinks Thibault was a legend and very helpful Would recommend going here if you want some decent feed Thanks again Thibault
We discover by chance to stop for a cocktail its a treat at the corner of the port and the fountain the cocktails are delicious and the welcome so warm Pleasure
Nice place relaxed atmosphere and delicious cocktails
Good value for money for the charcuterie and cheese board good choice of cocktails but a little expensive Nice atmosphere on the port and with live concerts The menus deserve to be cleaned they are dirty and sticky
Great evening with delicious ice cream cocktails and great service To absolutely redo
Had the fish and chips and the daily special being the octopus salad Definitely recommend Great flavor Affordable and easy to pay Would go again
Exceptional place great service big portions tasty food and amazing wine
Went here with my wife son 11 and our small dog Great service bilingual happy crew Food was excellent and array of craft beers to envy This is everything a no fuss European food restaurant should feel like and be Go and enjoy
A nice restaurant with both fresh and tasty food and a excellent service We were guided to a table despite being 4 in a sunny sunday without reservation And the waiter was friendly respectful and thoughtful The only slight issue was the little room we had around the table
Everything was really nice The hamburger was so good and drinks also All the staff was very friendly and helpful We will back soon  thanks 
We come late looking for a night cup one last drink before bed while comming from the beach The place looks good u can play some games and order nice drinks while seating inside or out and having a nice vue It was fun
2205 arrival Paying evening at the entrance 10 per person Early evening and we are informed that hibiscus cocktails are not available After more than an hour of waiting only one cocktail served out of three ordered a poor mojito cocktail that doesnt look like much a beginner waitress alone when everything is full on the terrace although friendly she is totally overwhelmed Very bad experience the time is very long when watching the other tables being served Reroll to get the cocktails several times 1143 pm still waiting for cocktails 1146 pm arrival of the last two cocktails finally offered by the manager to apologize Virgin mojito passion and bramble ordered finally two classic Virgin mojito after 2 hours of waiting Brief
I went to the afro brunch a superb good atmosphere chill music a menu full of flavor good concept Awesome team
Thoroughly enjoyed the food there The workers were really kind and helpful and everything we ordered was super yummy Really recommend this place
Place was super busy but were made to feel very welcomelamb tuna and salmon were all unusually prepped in a good way 
We had a great diner Good quality food fresh and diverse flavours The atmosphere is super cool too
Great delicious fusion food  Bigger than tapas smaller than normal portion let you explore delicious surprising and balanced flavors
We received a warm welcome from the staff in this restaurant situated in a charming atmospheric square just slightly off the main thoroughfare The food was excellent
A great place to have a vegetarian brunch 17 on Sundays The plate was tasty with surprising mixes like honey and beetroot and also  beautiful with a stylish colorful plating The atmosphere is friendly and familylike in the terrasse Even if the opening hours say 10am your order wont be taken before 1045 You can be served with a hot drink and viennoiseries in the mean while
This is so far our favorite place for a family Sunday brunch in Montpellier The setting is wonderful and relatively quiet on a Sunday morning The service is always wonderful and the food is consistently tasty
Just come for drinks Large selection of organic wine by glass The vouvray is delicious Will come back to try the food soon
Great place lovely staff and a lovely pint of plain in Strasbourg Food was very decent too Only negative is the table service  thing but thats a personal thing Id totally recommend you checked  it out
Iris h  pub
Looking for a drink  Wait 30 to 45 min if you are nice Avoid this place
Great experience very nice and great service also a good looking bartender Thank you
OBradys happens to be the meeting location for a weekly French conversational course which begins earlier in the evening so that the conversations are heard well enough  But before the end of the workshop the pub was getting crowded in lively A good sign for the pub
Nice local place to drink a beer It has a variety of beers It has a very big screen tv for watching football games It serves fast food
Good selection of domestic and international beers well made tarte flambees
I dont get the impression that the owner has any idea how to serve his costumers
2 stars for the poor cuisine and the pumped prices for everything while getting only 200 gr of the parody jamonstyle meat plate for almost 18 euros The service waiting time is insane as well You have to chase the waiters for hours Not worth it I dont recommend going to this place
High cost of food and beer very poor taste dont waist your money Good TV for sport only reason to I went in but I was so orry after 10 mins Toilet stinks not clean
Cool
Outstanding local food tartes flambee and beer Very nice staff If you stay nearby go there
While the atmosphere was acceptable the service for larger groups was truly disappointing During a visit with a group we placed orders and everyone paid for their drinks I paid for mine only to later be informed that it was considered a double and was asked to pay for it again  Its perplexing that I was charged double for a double cocktail essentially paying for two cocktails worth of alcohol In the end I paid for two cocktails when I could have simply ordered two regular cocktails with the same alcohol content for the same price This pricing inconsistency seemed unnecessary and confusing  This lack of clarity in pricing is concerning If they cant manage smooth service for groups they should reconsider their business approach Furthermore offering items without a clear pricing structure is a substantial issue This was our first time being charged for unexpected extras and it left a negative impression I would not recommend this place they try to make a profit from you in unethical ways  PS Make sure to order water early because it becomes smaller the later in the night This was an additional inconvenience that further soured the experience
We had a late night dinner at Le Public House  The service the prices and the food were all excellent  My husband especially liked their beers on tap  It was quite the happening place outside  but inside we were able to find ourselves a nice quiet table away from the crowd  Would happily return
Very nice casual and cozy restaurant There are lots of food items such as pizzas burgers salads and tarte flambes on the menu and they are very delicious The price is reasonable The staff is friendly Even though they dont accept reservations we managed to find a place as a big group The place is quite spacious Sitting outside on the terrace is also very pleasant when the weather is good
Great place nice IPA Galette de pomme de terre with smoked salmon was great Stuff is friendly price is reasonable
Great tobacco saleswoman very friendly and cigarettes cheaper than in France
I would like to give 0 stars unfortunately not possible
Seller  Unpleasant with the customer especially dont make mistakes because it makes him aggressive 
ATTENTION RIP OFF Bottom drawer
My visit to Drunky Stork Social Restaurant provided a mixed experience The standout features were the delightful cocktails and appealing decor However the portion sizes for the price were less satisfying
Fancy vibes tasty dishes great atmosphere We didnt like the service though as we felt hurried to chose to consume The waiter was being rather rude in his way of talking and interrupting us Not nice especially in this kind of place Prices on the high range and small portions Cocktails are far from generous on the dosage and not as researched and elevated as could suggest their price On the positive side the desert a mixture of fruits and meringue was incredible We all liked our main dishes as well Other all a nice evening still but I wouldnt add to the hype of the place
Beautiful deco and great music Our waitress was very nice and the service was overall pretty good Our food came out fast which is highly appreciated Only comment is that my risotto came piping hot while my partners was just warm
This restaurant in Strasbourg is one of the best places Delicious food the menu is totally different from any other places unique Portion size is good Prices are average Hostess security waiters and bartenders are very attentive and friendly and speaking English  and super nice atmosphere Also I really liked their wine list The idea with open window at the kitchen is very interesting   the kitchen looked so clean and obviously cooks were enjoying the process Can totally recommend it and will definitely come back again
Nice place good selection of beers and mix drinks with delicious Alsatian foods   Its worth a visit if youre in Strasbourg
I dont know if I was expecting a burger with a chunk of piece of meat in it instead of a patty I didnt get any flavor out of it or maybe it was its original taste Ive never had before Fries where good If your in France and like beer please try Gallia way ipa
Great place for the fumous tarte flambe flammekueche Well located in the center of Strasbourg Great vides especially in the evening with friends hanging out for relaxing beers and food Great value for money
We were in town and we were hungry Ive searched on google after a cheap and good restaurant It was the first Clicked on it checked the menu and went there It was 5 stars The service the guys there the food and the bier which by the way was recomended by them were very tasty Thank you guys for the nice evening we had there See you next time
The decor is lovely and the drinks gorgeous but the food was far too dry We ordered nachos and a veggie burger and couldnt finish them Its a shame because with more sauces they would have been delicious The staff were stone faced but so busy I think they were just stressed so I still tipped There were a lot of wasps so Id advise to sit inside if you are bothered by them
Very tasty and good terrace near childrens playground Also there is big parking with electric charging for Tesla
Very nice feeling and food was great
Tasty snacks and good Riesling
Friendly local bar Eclectic crowd quite easy to strike up a conversation Heavy metal oriented but not aggressively so It is possible to have a conversation without competing with ACDC played at full volume Worth a quick visit at least and you might just find you like the place Pavement seating by a quiet street in good weather
If you want a good beer listening to some good rockmetal in Strasbourg this is definitely your place The owner is a very nice guy by the way Cheers
It does what it says on the tin Its a bar that sells a reasonable variety of drinks and plays rock and metal music The staff and clientele are friendly Im looking forward to visiting again
Good shooters and cocktails try the dans ta face simple but good food nice beers Good prices and very nice owner
Stopped in for Breakfast on our first day in Strasbourg Very pleasant  and helpful server Pancakes with caramel sauce was delicious as were the scrambled egg and bacon Sat outside and enjoyed the sunshine
I love this place with a good portion of food the food is delicious the place is big that can host a big group of friends the service is fast etc
No food this time Great little pub off the beat with decent prices for a draft beer and drinks Cheers
Such a great place honestly The atmosphere was great the food was quite good and the waiters were super friendly and spoke English too It was also open on Christmas day something we were very grateful about
Amazing bar great drinks great food and decent prices Loved that it was packed yet not crazy loud Une vraie planque comme il se doit 
Really nice place  Good energy and fair price 
Average bar very kind staff and nice people Nothing special for me personally
Visited this place with a bunch of local friends great vibes awesome bar tending skills 
Decent drinks but unfortunately the wait times here are very long We had the cafe au lait and the chocolate chaud which were fine but we waited over 20 mins to order and around the same to pay Good atmosphere and ambience but dont expect fast service
amazing team and welcoming atmosphere  favourite bar to hang out  chill and honest  thanks for a good service and great conversations 
Absolutely great place outside the mainstream places to visit in Strasbourg Im a little sorry to share this place with you but I cant share it with you Beer  Kasteel Rouge is a pearl in the crown of this place
Ohh I love this cafe One of the best cozy places in all of Strasbourg The staff is very warm and welcoming The ambience is musical and peppy Live music on some days A must visit when in Strasbourg
Strasbourg is a pretty city this cafe is my favorite cafe in Strasbourg The cafe is amazing and sexy they have great music playing and you will enjoy your coffee or drink here Enjoy
The atmosphere is super nice I love the decoration with all the vintage items and the lights The service was nice and fast as well The food was good but nothing very special They have nice beers though I would go back
Nice atmosphere very informal The toasts that we tried were super tasty but the highlight of the dinner for me was the dessert Amazing The price is in the average I totally recommend it
Very nice little place to sit outside and have a drink or two soak up some Parispavement based atmosphere We also ate here which was good I finally had a salad Id been craving and couldnt get anywhere else We were not disappointed 
Good place  I think beers here are good most of the people were having beers Nice indoor and outdoor tables  The food in good nothing special about it I ordered ceaser salad the presentation was awesome actually it is so creative for the small size a half Lettuce was served with chicken nuggets anchovies Parmesan cheese and homemade dressing it has a different flavor than usual dressing the overall was fine The second order was flambe with cheese and no bacon was fine for us it was to much onion  but from unbiased point of view it was good The place is pricey for these two orders and one bottle of icetea costed around 4050 euros
Came here to watch the sports downstairs Service has been spot on We ordered the pig knuckle hot dog which was very tasty and was a good sized portion too Highly recommend
Strasbourgs oldest brewery Ambience is superb with a brewing kettle and other things displayed Taps look elegant and food was good Had Pork Shank with potatoes
Service was great We tried the traditional as well as the gratinee and mushroom tarte flambee And the escargot Everything was very fast and great
Great location good prices good cocktails friendly and fsst staff Music was excellent
Nice pub variety of beers and cocktails Friendly  staff fast service Food served is only pizza and tarte flambe with thin base gas oven baked and a variety of options to select from
We were here for a quick lunch and a drink but its a horrible experience The lasagne was a bit more acceptable compare to the roasted chicken but the minced beef in the lasagne was too fat The roasted chicken is literally cold inside We sent it back to kitchen but when we got it back it was so burnt and hard thought I was chewing the bones when I ate the chicken thigh meat
Avoid this dishonest place After letting us sit with empty glasses while they chatted amongst themselves they charged us 28 euros for two Armagnacs Thats pretty much theft in my opinion
Molly Malones is right across the street front the area where the Viking Forsetti docks We walked over and enjoyed a pint of beer and the rugby finals This is a very lively bar with a younger clientele A fun place to watch a game or meet new people
This has become our CanadianAustralian go to for fish and chips It is the best place for fish and chips in Bordeaux if not France by far Excellent value for money as well
Great little pub typical Irish atmosphere One major problem no air con so so hot in there Staff really friendly a new starter Noah in at the deep end at the start of the world Cup survived with admiration food great but dont expect fine dining great prices
Molly Malones has a good options for beer and cider Their own blonde and ipas are so cool Tried munster burger and it was ok as well Atmosphere was nice staff were friendly Recommended
Test new beers on draught or inbottles French and English languages are spoken by the welcoming boss Bar snacks available Great selection of Irish beers Outside terrace
Beers like you rarely find served by a passionate connoisseur who shares more than asked everything there is to know about beers and its brewers Enjoy
The managers are passionate and pleasant to talk to The atmosphere is quite nice and we drink good beer accompanied by a good sausage we had a good time
A nice place with good beer its a must for a discovery of tasty beers and explanations from the owner  Thank you Thierry
It was a fantastic experience The drinks were great the staff unbelievably helpful The food looked good unfortunately we had already eaten Typical pub grub

Happy Hour 19hr20hr Guinness
Great atmosphere and very friendly staff Whether its for adults of all ages its still a good place to meet Good music and good hygiene
I had a fantastic experience at the Blarney Stone thanks to Brad and Cameron Their warm hospitality made me feel right at home The atmosphere at the bar was welcoming and their service was topnotch I highly recommend visiting the Blarney Stone and enjoying the excellent service from Brad and Cameron
Barman really sympathetic and welcoming with a big smile Fast service reasonable portion and very good drinks I recommend Regarding the bar in itself its cute and pretty I really like the decoration and the atmosphere Plus the service team seems to be bilingual which is a really good point for foreigners
Service was great staff were friendly  food was good I had a nice beef hamburger with fried chips but the chips looked more like they had been reheated several times They werent very good
My favourite restorant in Bordeaux They are literally making the best chicken wings ever There are so many beer options on the menu But I recommend you to drink Brooklyn IPA It has some kind of a flowery taste The atmosphere is fascinating The staff is nice and kind You should definitely go there  PS please bring the pies to menu again They were also delicious 
Perfect English pub owner is incredibly friendly and welcoming Burgers are possiblythe best in Bordeaux
Fair play the ultimate 1970s pub experience warm lager with no head and Lucky dip glasses
Excellent service love the coziness of the spot and the owner whos just delightful  Also being vegan is never easy eating out but he always makes it work which I appreciate so much   One of my favorite spots in town 
Went there for a casual night out with a friend the big ben burger was really nice the beers quite good the waiter was really friendly and the pub has a real English vibe A great place
Very cozy atmosphere and good draft beers
Serves one of the best pints of Guiness Ive had in Bordeaux Also has a very nice selection of brewdog beers on tap Their food is also excellent Overall a lovely quaint little pub Well worth the stop
Really nice Irish  Pub in a French style Not a Guinguette but a GuinguIrish 
Cozy friendly and ideally located local pub in Talence The beer garden is very cool and the big hearts Anne and Sam along with their top staff Fabien and Maxime make all the ingredients for a great time Exceedingly good place
Definitely a decent boozer The draft selection has something for everyone and in general the beer quality is a consistant 610 Dont get your hopes up this chain leaves the beer lovers wanting more or less but you cant fault the location seating options sports channels and reliability
Excellent Pub and lovely staff highly recommended
Quirky songs being played while man utd played rubbish against bayern
Nice pub with lovely cold wine and nice cider
Good service  nice helpfull friendly staff

Need a real bar to watch matches in an Irish pub version An address called Odriscoll in Pessac authentic run by enthusiasts wide choice of beers and tapas in a cool atmosphere 
Great chicken and mushroom pie A must during these cold days Staff is friendly and attentive Good selection of English plates as well as a variety of beers
Came here hoping to find an English breaky Unfortunately it was not on the menu but they very kindly made us a real bacon sandwich BYO HP Proper bacon too 
Super pub great food Very friendly waitress we had great time 
Nice atmosphere and friendly service The bacon cheeseburger is very delicious Happy hours finish quite early in British style thats why the beer is a bit expensive
Great ambiance in the pub itself and as Irish bars abroad go its pretty good despite the English name  Lovely terrace tables on the square happy hour options are  and the guys  girls running the place are fantastic
Very disappointed I used to eat here regularly a couple of years ago and the burger was consistently delicious I went here last week and unfortunately the burger was nothing like it used to be The server didnt even ask us how we wanted our steak cooked The meat had no flavour the bun was too hard They sell a bacon avocado burger but they dont use real avocados  instead they use gross French guacamole which is nothing like Mexican or American guacamole A truly mediocre burger  The fries however are delicious  Also the restaurant was empty and we sat for almost ten minutes waiting to just get a menu  The server himself was friendly its just a shame that no one told us where to get menus or place an order I do not recommend
Excellent traditional English city pub in Chartrons  friendly service great beer and great food Recommended
I came there on Friday the bar tender is a really friendly young man The pub itself is very well decorated with old british style Its abit small though when there are lots of people I ordered fish and chips as a takeaway truly tasty crispy etc just perfect
In Bordeaux for the rugby and called into this place for a pint or two English speaking waitresses and bartenders with a great selection of craft beers and the usual classics Its on the more expensive side compared to back home but it is in the Center of Bordeaux and compared to other bars in the area its reasonable and they have a happy hour Just to let u know u pay a deposit on the plastic pint cup you drink out of but after u finish you get a 2 refund if you return it to the bar  plus big screens in the bar with English commentary
Was visiting Bordeaux and was recommended to check out this bar by a local Has a great atmosphere and the bar tenders were friendly and spoke english which helped when ordering I ended up coming back the next night
Pool table darts 8 euros for a Guinness though Decent vibes
Best Place for a fresh Beer Cris will make it for u 
We spent a great time eating nice typical English food and drink some great beverages from the country Moreover Linda the waitress was very kind 
The best atmosphere a very helpful gaffer who found us all seats would definitely recommend and when were back this will be our first stop  great spotthanks to all the staff
Had a beer and enjoyed the view  Friendly staff and good service
The staff is very nice clients are not up to their level monopolizing the pool table One sad point Credit card is only accepted from 10
When I came it was happy hour However  I was very un happy when I discovered that only beer is in the happy hour offers That after sitting at a table waiting for service before realising all the wooden markers that say order at the bar had blown over Then i got to enjoy everyone elses second hand smoke whilst consuming my drink 18 lighter but a little wiser
A great pub to watch rugby  Friendly service and a warm welcome
Well the bartender tried to rip us off the 1 consignment cups and very rudely decide not to serve us when serving the guy next to us Why  Still wondering Disappointed AF
This place was so lively only stepped in for one drink but got a whole local band sing along
One of the rare authentic pubs in the Irish tradition left in Bordeaux no fuss good stout darts and stools Limited options for beers but thats how you like a good old pub My favourite in Bordeaux by far
Excellent atmosphere and friendly welcome The Landlord was most accommodating and when we called in late afternoon last Wednesday I asked if he would be showing the Europa Conference league final He kindly reserved a table for us  Even though we were about the only English people in the Bar he very kindly bought us a drink when West Ham won the match Excellent Guinness as well
Very nice atmosphere very good service I would totally recommend
Nice sport bar Service is very good and your feel like at home as soon as you get in 
British style pub in the heart of the old part of the city  A good range of draught beers and spirits There are several TV screens in this place if you want to watch any sports events Also some limited outdoor seating
I love this place Its a great English pub with a strong Irish flair right and downtown Bordeaux right off the shopping district If you are a guy in particular and your lady friend is doing some shopping this is a great place to grab a cold pint
Worst pint of Guinness I had in my life Very fommy and smelled like egg  The ambiance is great though
Amazing place Great atmosphere friendly people and they have Long Islands on the optics 
A good pub where to have the time of your life with the several parties and sports nights available
Great pub food and atmosphere
Friendly and fun place with locals to have a cold cocktail after a long hot day in Bordeaux Felt safe as a single woman traveler Highly recommend
A lovely Englishstyled pub in the heart of Bordeaux This is a great place to come for a refreshing cold pint of beer  perfect for when a break is required from Bordeaux wines or even on a hot Summer day Many sports events are also shown here they have Sky Sports
Good service  helpful staff good food and Aperol Spritz not spoilt with Sprite  What else do you need
Came here to watch the Wales rugby match as It was stated on the website that it would be shown on the TV Only to find that because Bordeaux were playing football the same time that they were only showing the football because we were told Bordeaux are playing  Even though there were multiple Tvs and it said both would be shown If this was the case dont put it on your website Never been so disappointed we would have watched the rugby in Bordeaux before heading  to the airport  Where they would have been happy to show the match 
Great place for food and drinks on your way to Bordeaux airport Good menu offering pub grub and great service Gets busy so may have to queue to get in
Average place For some reasons they dont serve food outside only nibbles Staffs is very nice but waiting time to get a table far too longwe have been told 10 Min wait and we had a table after more than an hour Not ideal Food is expensive and nothing special
Super small with a super vibe Best Guinness Ive had so far in Bordeaux with a nice little plate of munchies plateau apritif and friendly staff Definitely a must visit if youre looking to have a cold beer in a warm pub
Super service Les barmansmaids tip top
Super ambiance  the bar attendants are very simpaticos  music can improve but its ok  I loved the fact that you can actually ask for pizza to be delivered just ask for the number in the bar and the best  Not expensive as must of the bars around and the drinks quality intact   Trop bon 
Lovely local with a very cosy feel and genuinely warm welcome from Franois behind the bara pint of Guinness for 5 before midnightGeorge would saywhat else Thanks
The food was decent Serving was good Nice location
Really great service tonight food was good I had a burger and the Mrs had a Caesar salad Three soft drinks also and the bill came to 45 Euros Our waitress was fab and looked after all the tables inside on the ground floor with a big friendly smile Recommended A place with a good atmosphere too
Great sports bar Big screens allot of beers and the decoration is awesome With allot of music instruments Price is ok The service very kind
Moules to beat the band but what we loved the most was the really wonderful service Perfect
This Irish pub in very popular with the locals and if you enjoy a good beer and a tasty midday lunch Im sure youll agree The atmosphere is pleasant and the wait staff are very friendly The fare is typical pub food and everything I have had has been very well prepared and tasty My personal favorite is the smokeflavored fish  chips best tartar sauce I have ever had too
The food was very good The place is cozy and beautiful It was a great experience
Cant rate the food as they dont serve food but they encourage you to order in if youre hungry therefore Ill give the food 5   Service was quick and the staff were friendly It was a great place to watch the World Cup games and Id recommend it to any traveling fans
Top bar Visited here a couple of time during our time in Lille for the Rugby World Cup Most of the time was just enjoying their amazing selection of beer but we visited once for food and it was fantastic Amazing staff great bar
Great place but quite popular so may want to make a reservation beforehand Great food but also bar to have a drink theres a guy cooking little salty waffles in the back theyre delicious
A nice Irish pub located next to Hotel de ville of Marcq en Baroeul  Great selection of beers with beautiful interiors Also some areas in the open to enjoy in the outside  Definitely a recommended place to hang out in groups Or enjoy some sports matches The service is also fast enough
Not enough space inside and Its mostly crowded So a big NO for winters You cant sit at the garden for long in the cold Better you go with a reservation for the dinner
Amazing service appetizers and beer were great
Place is small Staff is good enough Music is mixed old  new rnb rock country pop
Charging 4 euros for 025l when 05l is 5 euros is just not okay Also not willing to change the order when finding out is even worse Probably dont want customers to return
Didnt eat here but they serve great Guinness
Truly was a surprise As soon as I entered the loud music was initially too much But  quickly all that weirdness faded away just like that The crowd was amazingly fun  Super nice  and polite service   In total it was a pleasant evening Came for a drink and stayed for hours will visit again soon
Great atmosphere every time I went whether it be to watch sport or enjoy the evening
Very nice little bar with good music and fair prices
Bouncer from 61023 who for no reason lets me in anymore and this allows him to threaten me he asks me to go down the stairs which I can understand except that once on the sidewalk for Mr its still not enough he I have to leave and I cant stay in front of the bar he has fun counting to 3 and takes a customer as a witness what did he want to do I dont really know it was very special a shame overall a nice evening just a shame to lose Conso without really a valid reason because the bouncer doesnt let us in anymore
Came to quietly watch a football match loud music without sound while everyone kindly asked the waiter to put on the sound of the match Went to the mother opposite no regrets the people are pleasant unlike the waiter at the Maccallan who should perhaps do some smile training there Good evening elsewhere
Cracking wee sports bar with a good selection of beers Dont forget to try some Saucisson whilst youre there
There for Ireland V Scotland Rugby match Great atmosphere
Great pub Full of rugby fans for the world cup Great range of beers and good food
Great atmosphere friendly bartenders good enough choice of Belgian beers on tap No food just some snacks
Cozy bar good atmosphere I go there for the language exchange every Wednesday at 8pm
A nice atmosphere I felt like being in a pub again Big plus it was not too crowded for a Saturday We had some nachos with a Scottish beer a good way to celebrate Robert Burns Night on our own
This place looks like an ordinary english pub The stuff if nice but I didnt feel comfortable there There is no Soft menu so the bartender had to cite few options that they had And I would like them to have more soft and snack options and to put softs in the menu
Cocktails are good and the employees are friendly we ordered nachos it was good as well The music was too loud we couldnt hear each other In general the bar is good and the prices are pretty reasonable
We went here for the first time a very big menu with loads of drink but we were afraid that the food wouldnt be that fresh But the food was absolutely fantastic We looked online to book a table but we couldnt so we went here for a drink around 1700 Once there we asked if they had a table for 4 at the evening around 2000 and it was no problem  We were pleased to get a table because during the evening on a Saturday the pub was full with people to eat  The food was absolutely fantastic It tasted fresh nice presented and the staff was lovely On the momebt of our visit it was pretty busy but the food came out in about 20 minutes wich was perfect  We will remember this place when we go back if we could we wouldve went back the day after  Thus is one to remember Good and fair prices friendly staff and a very nice interior with loads of history imagespaintings
Amazing discovery in Lille The food is delicious the staff friendly and funny I had an amazing date with my husband Thank you
We were there for diner I did order the salmon burger Fries along the burger were cold Salmon tastes like it was heated in the microwave So the dish is not suggested My girlfriend firstly asked if it was possible to remove the shrimps from the fish wok This wasnt She decided to order the tagiatella with buratta Tast was fine and she got a really full plate Drinks were fine and staff was friendly Maybe recommended for drinks but not for food
We both had burgers and chips Presented nicely and delicious We were looked after by a student who was efficient and charming Thank you for good service Lovely end to our last day in Lille
Very friendly local bar for some travelling rugby fans
Cozy barpub with some bar games and friendly staff Its seems not very big but I think its possible to be seated in the basement as well Nice choice of beers and cocktails and also possible to order nice looking burgers Its close to the city center and a few minutes from the busy student bar streets
Great bar great staff managed to watch the football too
It would have been 5 stars if I could remember the last couple of hours
This is the best pub with he best mates music with the best most precessional songs and staff in Europe
Nice bar to hang out with ur friends and loved ones they serve good alcohol and they have different types of it and a really old school feelong architecture so overall perfect combination
Whole bar got pepper sprayed by over zealous bouncers
Great atmosphere and good selection of draught beer Hugely enjoyed our saturday night here Excellent selection of music
Booked for a 9pm RWC game and excellent table put aside for us with the best view in the house Wide choice of beer too
Good pub can get super packed  but staff are nice and a great atmosphere for the rugby
Lovely to sit outside  Good beers A little quieter than being in the centre  Would recommend

worst placehe will talk to you nicely the waiter when you drunk he will add you extra beer will make you pay more with smile never go there if you want to get drunk
Really nice atmosphere
Christoph was so nice
Professional and very courteous welcometo have a drink with colleagues or friendscosi so British setting choice of cocktail and reasonable priceI recommend 
This place is a machine fastest service very efficient Every drink we ordered as a group showed up 3 minutes later
I have seldom see such an AWFUL place in regard to dirtyness or level or service Both waiters were rude with all customers and the coffee of poor quality is at 39 Please do not go there
The beers are super expensive The glasses were not really clean and there was stuff flooding in the beer old beer Not clean tap
Super bad attitude the waiters dont give a single Fq about consumer Definitely not recommend
One of our favourite restaurants excellent every single time Best burgers mussels are also excellent very good appetizers delicious desserts wide variety of drinks and a 5 stars service Add a nice cozy place and you have all the ingredients for a great dinner
I enjoy the meat and the mood And we will see us again soon Its a very satisfying service
The welsh royal is a typical dish of Le bureau and iconic of northernfrance cuisine Very friendly staff a great variety of drinks and its inside a mall venue so you can enjoy a beer after doing your shopping
Excellent place for both food and drinks Good atmosphere  excellent staff  Well worth a visit
Very warm welcome upon my arrival by all the staff Servers smiling and available I had a Flemish stew with fries which was delicious Very good desserts The decoration of the restaurant is tastefully done I recommend and I will return
Very good restaurant which quickly serves delicious dishes prepared with fresh products The atmosphere is friendly and the prices very affordable
A good moment  A nice service with a waitress see 2 pleasant and professional Indeed we were a table of 12
The dishes are excellent and quite varied for a brasserie They even make woks The room is very pleasant and the terrace set up on the sidewalk is rather pleasant the parasols are very large so that you can find shade in the bright sun the neighborhood is nice You can taste good beers like Raoul which is excellent The daily special is very reasonably priced and the plates are well stocked see photo In addition we feel the safety aspect is taken seriously the servers have masks hydro gel available happy hour at 4 pm I recommend the place
A great spot for any meal at any time of day I was fortunate enough to have breakfast and dinner here Staff were friendly and helpful My French is poor but managed to order a decent breakfast Dinner was good but a little messy The cheese in the burger had a very low melting point but was delicious Highly recommended
Very nice restaurant in the middle of everything  Excellent selection of beers and a variety of mussel preparations   I had the Chti variety which was a new experience for me The cheese sauce made eating the mussels a little more of a challenge but the taste was a fine reward  The staff was friendly and very helpful  The protests that are ongoing this week were passing through the area and the staff was vigilant and comforting while remaining calm and professional
Went for a family evening meal here and enjoyed every part of it Had a table quickly our waitress was an absolute star and I think our babies first crush The food was great too Moules in tasty sauce chicken with a lovely sauce too and a burger that was cooked perfectly and tasted as good as it looked Highly recommend coming here if youre in the area
Good food it was our first time trying Welsh we were expecting it to be greasy like a tartiflette but was pleasantly surprised that it was relatively light and fluffy Also tried the Carbonnade flamande similar to beouf bourgignon but with beer instead of red wine and really enjoyed it as well Beer selection was good Service was top  Our host was super friendly and went above and beyond 
A bit too expensive but the food is super tasty Either way 85 euros for 50cl of beer is insane
Nice food and at a good price too
Top 
Super service
very warm welcome good atmosphere and good food A very pleasant visit
Such a very nice time at au bureau with Haris Very nice waiter  Very professional with a lot of humour The food was great we did not waited long to get served and he was always making sure we had a nice moment  Thank you Haris 
Had a quick dinner in this quite nicely decorated pub brasserie Honestly the place was full but the waiters were handling it like bosses So a fast delicious dinner at a good price 50 for plat  dessert for 2 A nice surprise for my saturday evening 
The atmosphere and the service was good Unfortunately the ribs and burgers were too dry
Nice and quiet bar with comfy booths I visited this place on a Saturday night and it was not too busy The music is not too loud therefore making conversations easier compared to loud bars The staff were friendly enough
We had wings and nachos  The wings were crispy and the hot sauce was flavorful The nachos were a bit of a disappointment  They needed more of everything as you end up eating a lot of dry chips in the end  Great atmosphere and good beer
What a great and cozy place for a pint or 5 Lots of different seating areas perfect for any occasion 
Such  very good place to have fun with friends and play some games
Really cool small Irish Pub with local beer and multiple whiskey offers
Really good and nice pub in the city center The downstairs offers a really great and enjoyable experience with small booths and tables Upstairs has a lot of space and there is often live music also The atmosphere in Molly Malones is always really great I highly recommend that you pop in there if you are in the area and want a drink
The bartender Ieva was super kind and professional She gave us the best drink and service we had in our four days visit in Helsinki She was fun and delivered the best customer service One could say she is made for this place
Nice pub although the top floor was closed when we went I used to live in Ireland for several years so I could say it is kind of authentic Nice and quite for a chat with your friends I am curious to see the top floor so i have to go back The staff were friendly enough
Nice cosy bar The bar tender is energetic and friendly
Really nice Irish pub on a quiet side street not the biggest of places but always nice to have a Guiness They also did a good range of Finnish specific drinks
Unfortunately lost its soul Used to be great place but now very small too sleak without any soul
Perfect irish bar in dead center of helsinki
Best place to wait for a bus in Kamppi
I like the owner attitude is spot on to the  local pub like this And thats the funny part in the middle of Helsinki youll have a proper old school pub no fuss no huss  Love it
Very nice place to Huang out with friends
It does live up to its name I counted at least two windows Very good in this economy
Great Pub with friendly staff in the city center of Helsinki Havent tasted the food but that should be fine as well
A very wide choice of beers Definitely a musttry if youre into craft beer Domt forget to order the lets make a pizza beer without confusing the bartenders 
Henrys was great Awesome beer selection Didnt eat but several options and what I saw looked good Pool tables available and sometimes live music
I decided to visit Henrys pub during my visit to Helsinki I was greeted by friendly bar staff who spoke great English who also took the time to show me some Finnish drinks and give me some recommendations The atmosphere was really chill and having a pool table and shuffle board is an added bonus I would recommend this bar to anyone visiting Helsinki
Very nice staff and cool glowing pool room with other games too to play while you might wait for your table
Good tables and good prices in the happy hour for table rental
Staff was good but the pool tables were not in the best condition
Probably the best pool place in Helsinki New area is now glowing  so glow pool and darts And also really nice arcade machines
Good local pub As norm for the area its leaning more towards price than qualityselection
A fraction better looking common bar for common people Interior design is comfortable with a tad darker brown color palet which feels cozy and spacious overall  Nothing much to complain here really Its a cozy place with decent prices with even happy hour Regular lager from tap isnt too special really but this clearly is a bar for common people Theres quite big screens for watching sports from table while enjoying your liquid beverages  If youre looking for common people pub that isnt too hip then this could be your choice Service was friendly and fast too Foreign bartender reminded that there was a happy hour going on so regular tap lager was even cheaper  I recommend this venue for small groups looking for a starting point for longer evening or cure for yesterdays a bit longer evening
Service standard is very low staff is present for his own pleasure watching television  very loudly behind the bar and makes it obvious that ordering disturbes him Beer is watery taps obviously have not been cleaned Premises are basically nice from Pickwick Pub times but they have not been maintained and have gone to pot
Nice place but it is a bit past its best
Classic Kallio bar cheap beers great experience to see how raw a place can be Bartender was really friendly though
Not a safe space for women Bartenders think its ok for totally wasted men to harrass women there Yesterday one very drunk big man was harrassing my friend there telling things like Ihana hedelmllinen perse voinko vhn puristaa etc I told the bartender and he was only laughing about it and served the drunk harrasser more beer I asked why they are serving men who harrass women and the bartender said he said he is sorry No the man wasnt sorry and kept harrassing my friend when the bartender left So I said If he doesnt go we will and we left with my friend not even finishing our drinks We were the only 2 women in the whole bar  and no wonder why Women dont go to such places where they are being harrassed In good bars such men are kicked out and women can have their drinks in peace without anybody harrassing them Anyway the harrasser man was so drunk that by law he shouldnt have been served anymore Never going to Roskapankki again after this
Nice terrace and cheap drinks Opens early 9am
Cheap beer and comfortable outdoors seating
Good selection of beers Dont order a Irish Coffe Music very annoying rolling stones paint it black on repeat so the first couple of times ut was great but now I cant stand the song anymore and will probably have nightmares tonight
Cosy residential district bar affordable prices and good selection
You ask for peanuts and you get a huge bowl of peanuts at least 300g for two persons The place has good prices and the guy running the place is absolutely friendly and kind You get a beautiful view at one of the busiest intersection in Helsinki A Lonkero for 5 euros Thats a bargain
Perfect place for a chill night out with a couple friends Many people go there to read a newspaper over a pint as well Clean friendly staff and average bar prices Popular place among both students and older people
Nice place for having a beer with university friends Medieval manor look price on average Suggested
Nice hidden pub in the centre of Helsinki Its a great place to bring a group of friends hang out and play some games but not really a place for dancing or partying The tables are quite far from each other so its good if you dont want to be bothered by some loud drunk groups next to you
A unique place in the heart of Helsinki city centre in the sense that the interior is very similar to a cellar pub without actually being underground And the atmosphere is comparable to a cosy cellar pub as well The inexpensive and decent selection of beers makes this pub a joy to visit if you can ignore the noisy university students frequenting the place
Great place Average prices awesome people Friendly staff And we met a good looking chemistry teacher who got me drunk but i did not mind D
It took one hour between the first meal at our table and the last We were 11 people Two orders were wrong the sandwiches were dry Very strange place
I dont like places too formal and stuffy and Teerenpeli has a proper relaxed chilled vibe This was my first time visiting here but will definitely return Great for a drink after work or just to pop in with mates if out and about During our Saturday night also a DJ was in the house
Great place to try good Finnish whisky and beers The name is a bit misleading if you look inside you see its more a bar rather than a restaurant Beer snacks were rather boring
Good selection of craft beer very nice bartender who helped me pick out a few beers to try and the cold cheese board was very good  I also noticed that they have board games available which is nice 
Lovely place especially second floor Love the design Where you can sit in a big chair enjoy your drink and watch from second floor to a big hall inside mall of tripla Wonderful place to spend some time There is also at summertime terrace Wonderful selection of beers
Tap beer selection good some Finnish microbrewery beers also Table a bit sticky  Would go again
Generic but quite nice place to wait trains to leave
Nice to sit next to window and see people going and coming Beer is not cheap Service is good
Plain neighborhood pub nice staff
Ok
Cozy little place with cheap beer
Just a regular local bar
Today I had the worst experience of my life there  After work I went to this bar and ordered a plate of wings and a small beer It was crowded I found a long empty table two men were sitting at the beginning and I was sitting at the end I place my bag on the empty chair next to me After a few minutes a group came to the same table and one of them asked to take my bag I asked him why He said Because we are ten people I put my bag under my legs After 2 or 3 minutes when I got my food he looked at my plate and started talking to the group I dont understand Finnish but I heard one word from his contextpakolainen The security man was 15 meters away so I asked him I dont understand Finnish can you tell me what pakolainen means He said refugee Is this racist word yes it is This person said to me after looking at me What is your job as a security officer Can you show me that we have an equal system in Finland and that we all have the same rights and that racism is prohibited by law After a short conversation with him the security said in English I didnt mean it if thats what offends someone sorry he says and as a security officer I didnt hear exactly what he said so I couldnt bear to take him outside the bar I said Okay Ill leave without eating but How would you react if a foreign group used slang words against a Finnish man you were working as a security guard at the time The security had no answer Even he didnt offer to refund me or say sorry
Large and busy restaurant with wide beer selection Tasters are available for 225pcs We met only one beer brewed by Social Brewing Lab
I have tried this place during my stay at Helsinki after arrival to the Kamppi bus station A great place to have your dinner before or after departure with some good beer Might be not easy to find in the center but its definitely worth it The Schnitzel size is fairly generous  I barely could finish it on my own
A brewery pub at Kamppi Center in downtown Helsinki A fresh and fruity brew on tap
One of the nicest basically the only Irish pub in Tampere While there is no competition it doesnt mean that its bad Quite the opposite good food good atmosphere good people Better that you visit rather than settle for anything else
The only actual Irish pub in Tampere Very welcoming place kind and professional staff a great selection of beers And very tasty and properly sized pub food You will be hardpressed finding better fish and chips in the wide area around Tampere
Friendly staff and quite a large selection of beers on draft Fish n chips was delicious fresh and delivered hot immediately from the kitchen Cozy and warm inside chill vibes and steady crowd even for a Tuesday
The whiskey marinated beef Sloppy Joe with a Guinness was the best dinner I could ask for Great place
Lovely place with good chilling music and atmosphere Also one of the best service and customer experience in a long while Prices are average not bad Remember to ask offers from the bar
A nice small and cosy bar located along the main street of Tampere Youll get your drinks here in nicely decorated surroundings with reasonable prices Has also some outdoor seating during warmer months
Disrespectful and rude staff Not for people younger than 24 at least on Saturdays
You expect a good but not perfect pint of Guinness if you want to call yourself Irish pub But the pint was one of the worst I had Can give you a tip learn how to fill a proper glass
Absolutely one of the best traditional Finnish drinking holes in Tampere
A friendly cheerful crowd in the heart of Hervanta suitable for hanging out or catching up with friends
Great pub to chill
Cool
Very nice Englishstyle pub Obviously everything is still very new but give it a few years and the interior will be really authentic Great atmosphere
Food is always great the staff is lovely and cheery and the place is clean  Shoutout to what is imo by far the best fishchips in town Lunch is worth a visit too Some of the taps are a bit on the more expensive side but they do offer student discounts and the selection is excellent
Chicken salad was good  Reuben toast quite good as well  Nice atmosphere and great service
We had drinks and a salad  gambis Everything else was great but the shrimps were not nearly as good as in Levis Old mates
Happy hour 
Better than reputation Friendly staff but some of the customers are certainly a bit rude  Age range 50100
A basic neighborhood bar and not in a positive way
Well this place is at least too loud for me so its not from the best end
A bar offering you drinks and some pub grubs Quite nicely decorated but prices on the high side  Opens at 9 am every day gives an idea about the clintele   Pub quiz on Tuesdays at 1900 and live music on Fridays after works
Comfy and reasonably priced place It can be crowded sometimes but I wouldnt mind that
Great bar Simon the owner is friendly  the bar hosts live music on certain nights  Try the meatballs with fries theyre lovely
Very cosy and convinient Warm and friendly atmosphere Perfect for a boardgame night Would definitely come again
Cozy British style pub with their own real ales on tap Just across the railway station Playlist consist punk and ska so extra points from that
There is a great selection of drinks and the best vegan food we could find in Tampere The deepfried pickles and seitan wings especially are both unique and delicious The bar itself has a really relaxed and welcoming atmosphere Highly recommended
From the bartender to the chefabsolutely top notch  Burger one of the best tasted tops in Tampere but also burgers tasted from Southern California and EUone of the best experiencesa big thank to the chef himself 
A nice jewel in Tampere downtown The music vibe and service are as great as the drinks they offer You definitely need to stop and take a drink there before continuing with your day Whatever you choose you wont be wrong 
Great place to pop oin for a beergood classic pub
Its a bit more expensive than average pubs downtown but the place pays of with its coziness and good beers variety
The best pub in Finland as far as Im concerned Unique atmosphere and damn fine beers
Nice full pints in an authentic looking english pub
Great beer selection Very cosy place Found my favorite Bavarian beer here
Good selection of craft beers from all around the world Untapped verified
A very nice multitap bar with a great choice of beers You can find both craft beers from nearby and from all over the world including more than a dozen on tap  Theres been a nice vibe of friendliness and lack of rush when I was there
A very great variety of drinks gotta come back again to try some more Havent seen a place with as many draft beers yet
Friendly cool staff and nice drinks Totally recommend visiting
Cool
A nice quiet place to visit alone Pleasant service
The bartender barked at me like a wet dog and said I smelled like a wet dog
A nice bar not far from the Alexander church They have a big variety of beers on tap and they taste delicious An excellent place for beer lovers About the food I cant tell anything I had only beers
If you look for the old pub vibe of the 80s stirred up with a nice selection of beers then you should pay here a visit When I visited there was a quiz going on in finnish so I couldnt understand it  that added a bit more of charm to the whole evening
The oldest pub in Pyynikintori and it has been there longer than I can remember been in legal drinking age  Cosy atmosphere with nice selection of beers on offer Outside seating available during summer months is a nice addition
This joint has really turned for the better It is now an official Untappd venue and has the beer selection and taps to go with that position If you like great draft beer make the small 10 minute walk up here from the centre
Nice cozy atmosphere for some drinks with your friend They have their own brewery and distillery so you can order tastings if you like Whiskeys are pretty good
The sandwich was absolutely disgusting Cheap supermarket bread bland vegetables non existent blue cheese I give extra star for the whisky which i liked otherwise i would strongly advice against eating here
Amazing whiskeys Great service Definetly worth a visit
Number 1 in Finland  Nice atmosphere very nice people come And a very good selection of craft beers
Amazing drinks and a lot of different games to choose between If you like boardgames or videogames this is the bar to go
Amazing gaming pub You can play any console from retro to modern ones
A fun place to gather to with friends If you are looking for something chill to do with some drinks and friends in the city centre this is certainly the place Lots of tabletop card and videogames Theres a 10 student discount on certain items too
one of the nicest placeses in Finland to spend time The staff is very friendly and easy to talks to They also have a good selection of craft beers if you are interested I highly recommend this place to anyone
Outside tables were to shakynext time I will sit inside But the beer was good and staff very nice to us Great location of this pub makes you not go further Easy and good choice
Great selection of beers during the Oktoberfest We particularly liked the Tumma Dark Good friendly bar staff always serving with a smile
Great place with great service and a big terrace They have a lot of Plevna beers but other choices too Prices were ok and it was a good stop
My type of pub great selection of beers on tap and bottle I personally like the decor rustic and down to earth No kitchen so either eat first or stop here on the way to the restaurant
We went for a walk when we passed by what a nice place it is
A warm cultural atmosphere steeped in nostalgia Its nice to start and end the theater evening with a glass Prompt friendly staff
Thats just how it rumbles on year after year Nice feeling good location Not a permanent place but nice to stop by for a glass when going to the theater Friendly service once again
Henksu and the customer base are top notch 
Not a huge selection of beers but very nice selection still Irish pub style decor and decent amount of seats Not too cheap one either for the location
Beautiful terrace outside in the summer   Okay selection of tap beers
Nice outdoor terrace during the summer  Decent selection of beers  Good setting as well in a local neighborhood next to a park
Nice small and cozy Thet have pool and darts to play for a reasonable price
Jam out and Chill Period
Staff was really nice and warm good atmosphere You should try rak if you havent before
The guy at the bar was so nice to each and every customer and it was lovely to watch and experience
The owners are the best Everyone is welcome
Tasty Food and great atmosphere They have a pretty big beer selection Not too busy it was easy to get a seat Its a pretty big place Very clean restrooms Coffee seemed a bit old not a big deal though
Did not try the food but there was large selection of their own beers and some of them were great others not but that comes usually with a large selection of very different beers Prices were great for the drinks food seemed bit pricy The place is huge and decorated like a true brewpub When we visited there was even an Oktoberfestband playing my girlfriend was thrilled to hear some German honkytonky beeing played
The best Finnish beer And the best place to taste Finnish traditional food  Update  So many times have been visited this place can say 100 all my international and Finnish guests in Tampere are visiting Plevna and everyone are happy about service and food  love forever
Best sausages in Town The staff is super friendly Try their blood sausages or the meat platter One of their kind
Gallows has real ale aka no carbonation added Ask for it By far the best type of beer you can get So fresh tasting and refreshing
Had a few drinks on a Monday evening The craft beers were awesome and the staff is one of the friendliests Ive ever seen Kiitoksia
Quick pit stop after few recommendations from locals And what a pleasant surprise I have not seen such selection of draft beers anywhere around As bonus thats a micro brewery 
We took their local blonde wheat beer and German Pohjnatie Excellent drinks specially the local one fresh light perfect for a summer day between friends The place is very cozy different sittings  table games music Great place
Nice atmosphere and a good selection of different beers Real ale and real cider are a big plus 
Gets away really well from the hustle and bustle of the shopping center and really good faucets 
Cozy place inexpensive draft beer is missing
Very cozy and good Bisset
Nice drink selection but could have wider range of snacks
Very nice For some reason all the beer bottles are pretty much equal in price regardless of quality Which is nice since it makes for probably the cheapest Rochefort 10 in town The location is a little strange but otherwise the place is lovely
Nice beer pub with clean and smart decor For my experiences staff has always been really professional and dressed really snappy which gives nice extra touch Toilets have been clean and terrace is really good Sun shines there long period and they also serves to the table so you can just sit and enjoy Prices are bit on the high side but that is expected for the place that is in big mall and next to railwaybus station And well This is Finland so all alcohol is expensive
We unassumingly stumbled onto this bar looking for a latenight drink and were pleasantly surprised The interior is cozy and spacious they have plenty of interesting European beers and service was friendly Although it wasnt a mindblowing experience I have a hard time coming up with any negative points for this bar so 5 stars seems appropriate Id say this is a great choice if you just want to have a drink with friends even late in the evening
Great service and helpfull staff The sports on the tv where a bit too loud so it was a bit disturbing and also we had some dibbs on the check which we paid for even when we did nor order or receive them Also some of the portions ordered could have been larger Anyhow great food 
I come here for beer sport and chicken wings cant comment on anything else its a great place for all three particularly the wings  really meaty coating stays crunchy sweet heat on the buffalo sauce  and the sport  best place Ive found to watch UK rugby in Finland Not cheap but its pretty much in Helsinki so suck it up Plus Iso Omena is an awardwinning shopping centre so everyone wins except the wallet
I have been here quite number of times the atmosphere is nice the food in general is nice however the food quality fluctuates quite much one days is super the other day ita rubbish rubbish happnea quite seldomely Beer  collection is nice and the serving is done with a good standard meaning if a mug neesa to be cold then they will serve it as cold All in all a very nice place
Typical sports bar food but a decent bar and restaurant area with plenty of TVs and a variety of sport showing at any time
Thats what the neighborhood pub atmosphere calls for The heel trolls sit in lodges and improve the world over a pint In summer this is done on the terrace The pool table in the back represents sports A perfectly rugged place with no frills right next to the metro station And the prices really fit
Just the right place for the place Offers exactly the kind of bar experience that is needed Wellpriced drinks suitable offer and appropriate atmosphere Suitable for dating and starting out Becoming a permanent place of its own as long as the going doesnt change
it was free time time passed quickly and comfortably while sitting there 
Nice to stop by  Nice group 
A cozy place with nice corners Like your own living room where the family welcomes you with a cold malt drink Great experience thank you Peijjooni 2020 3
Lack of investment in interior designcomfort Maybe the locals dont need anything else as long as the empty tank is replaced with a new one
I cant recommend it but the local gang might like it
Good mate Billiards and jukebox with beer
Smoking room maybe never had its air extractor or filters cleaned so the whole bar smelled of stale cigarettes and the worst plastic flower I have ever saw stick under the window but to be fair it was a nice pint at a good price
I spent there best night in Turku 101 blue whales stacked on top of each other 
A nice place with a comfty atmosphere Gives you an excellent view of finnish drinking culture no matter what time of day you visit Drinks are cheap and the only background noice is the happy banter of the customers no music whatsoever Singing will actually get you kicked out Well recomended if you want a true piece of finnish culture a small bite to eat or just a beer or twenty
Ok
Quiet pub Karaoke on weekends
Amazing 
A cozy city dwellers living room on the stone base of the house During the day it was fun to go out with the work crew for a beer There are many board games and 2 x TVs in the pub The toilets are really clean The owner who worked behind the counter had a very good sense of humor and during the afternoon we laughed several times at this gentlemans stories I recommend a visit
Old but cozy
Just on the corner 6th Street
Very good place
Was a nice experience
The beer is good and a bilis table was also found Waiting for the terrace
Its the ideal BarPub to chill after dinner andor before go to a NIGHT CLUB The perfect spot to hang around while getting the moode for a late party
Great wings and Grid Potatoes Quiet atmosphere on a Monday evening
Great Irishpub near river Aurajoki Guinness in tab
Nice selection of alcoholic beverages and even some tasty basic food options Sometimes theres gigs sometimes they are free I dont think its a good venue though on the free gigs at least theres usually so much people that it gets hard to breathe
Good friendly friends Not staff But friend that will give you a taste of local bar Finito Mi Birra 
A small and intimate bar with a jukebox Plenty of magazines to read A somewhat legendary place
One of the originals
What a charming bar Karaoke Atmosphere from the 80s Many of the customers are real downers I will definitely go again
Old style finnish pub Clearly not for suited customers but rather the otherside of regular folk and unique characters They have a patio at courtyard and occassional live music
Legendary rock bar Cramped seating half of the denizens look as if theyve just escaped from the intergalactic penitentiary on the planet Zarb the other half actually have and are in disguise as a result Superb  drunken conversations to be had Home I wouldnt instantly recommend for children straights or tourists which is undoubtedly its charm
This is a down and dirty bar with cheap prices unsophisticated primarily male clientele and a grimy atmosphere Wrth a visit if you want to see an authentic bar with no frills and dont mind a bit of banter from locao drunks who definitely dont speak a second language at least well
Ramones
Quite a nice place for some beer drinking With a student card beer cists 3 90 euro
Same old same old With the pandemic and lockdowns I had not been to Portti since 2020 The place hasnt changed and still a great place where to hang out after a long day of work
A lovely pub that has studentfriendly prices present a valid student ID card for a beer at 450  Also has happy hour pricing before 9 PM for an even greater price reduction Features good ambiance a very friendly staff and an excellent selection of beers both on tap and in bottles
Good bar much beer 55
Nice place for a beer Their selection of Danish beers is especially exciting as there are not many places where you can try out craft beers from Denmark in the city Fairly close to the city center and has a nice atmosphere Also sports a big screen for sports events
For someone who likes beer this is probably a 5 star place my beer enthusiast friend picked the place but as a cider lover this was also really nice A good sortiment and the bartender was knowledgeable and had good suggestions Definitely recommended
Bar is cute and nice to sit with friends talking and watch sports 
Always good selection of beers and recently interesting whiskies Terrace is especially nice during summer as the traffic is surprisingly quiet even though it is in a corner spot
Nice and friendly staff open minded and qualified The bar has a nice retro lookfeel and a huge terracelike area outside Prices are ok and lower than in many bars at the river Cocktails were very tasty well and fresh prepared  All chairs face the pedestrian walk which makes pedestrians feel like being on a catwalk Thats interesting to see from both perspectives 
There are usually many customers here so you may not find sitting place  It has vintage interior  reminding me bars in London  It has cost atmosphere so you dont get bored  Summer time there is big terrace to sit outside to enjoy sunny days 
excellent selection of beers including Newcastle Brown Lovely staff wifi and spicy fishchips Very content
Most popular bar in town
Lovely place  great drinks  Mango Martini Mango Collins
Cheaper beer for students and they turned the Ireland match on on a huge screen just for us
Typical chain pub Nothing personal but then again nothing too bad Poor selection though
A nice bar Priced well and its very comfy Staff was nice and warm Really liked this place
Was very excited to find the pub in an old bank building Great place to get some food and drinks Lovely and kind staff
Great music good vibes The change from a horseshoe bar to one against the wall can cause a crowd at the bar but now the main space is open and easier to chat with other patrons
It was surprising to see decent food prices in a restaurant in Finland But when we got the food we understood why  the portions were for kids rather than adults so in the end the price was rather high for what was really offered The staff was nice
Extremely toxic bouncers Violent One of the bouncers threatened to punch out my teeth
Has a bar counter seating and cocktails Quite limited selection of cocktails that seem to be really basic GT with frozen blueberry and a pinecone hard to tell if it is foodsafe Very limited selection of whisky and fresh ingridients They dont even have a sharp knife to cut lime thin is it a wedge or a slice They mostly dont care about presentation  garnishes they dont shake whisky sours well enough to have an acceptable egg white foam head They ask decent money 11 per drink for sloppy work Space behind bar is organised poorly and two bartenders have to share one station being in each others way They obliged with my requests Penicillin results were passable but not quite worth the money Sorry
Easy going place in the city centre and really nice bartenders
Nice bar downtown quiet music on the background until dj arrived Nice service too
Best cocktails in town I ve been few times and I was disappointed by the music Simply killing your mood
The BEST and greatest whisky selection that Ive come across in Finland so far The perfect old pub set up for one to enjoy his scotch Irish  Canadian or Bourbon among many more choices And the senior bartender behind the bar counter just add more panache to the space Great taste also in the playlist of classics from American old rock n roll
Whiskey bar is a great place to sit and drink with friends Not too crowded and over 200 whiskeys on offer Low key come as you are
Nice bar large collection of whiskey Music is mostly rock the place is quite small and usually crowded and the toilets are in pretty bad condition All in all a decent bar for a drink but not the most sophisticated place you can go to
Best bar in Turku After a couple of years the same
Friendly neighborhood atmosphere Shaggy bar dog is Emma Pool table and board games Pizza with many toppings and meatballs with pickles were tasty Big TVs for sports English is spoken if thats an issue
Excellent service and cozy atmosphere
Cool  place for drink and eat pizza
Pizza  45 Beer selection  45 Staff  55 Bonus terrace  pool table
Great atmosphere great service
Very pleasant bar near Turku Market Square Number of customer places is surprisingly big Music is on reasonable volume and discussions possible The place is also sportsfriendly I would very likely be regular if lived nearby Open late also on quiet evenings
Nice service enjoyd my first ever music bingo
Quite basic if a little fancy place It was cozy and felt nice and clean Staff were nice and knowledgeable Normal price range and good selection of drinks
Good bar where you can drink yourself jolly until 5 am or so Staff is friendly and the prices are right as rain  There is a bunch of screens showing sports and a delightful jukebox  Also great location
What do you want from a bar Note a bar not a restaurant that serves drinks nor yet a themestyled pub with pretensions to grandeur The Bristols main virtues are those in Orwells classic essay on The Moon Under Water  Very good friendly staff a good range of keg and bottled beers a comfortable lived in ambience which makes no concessions to dirt a clientele that mind their own business and yet the mot juste can be offered with friendliness and wit Indoor smoking facilities are available through a dedicated room  There are quizzes frequently on music cinema and general knowledge but these do not so much intrude as decorate and enhance the drinking experience Ditto the large stock of board games if you are that way inclined Football and ice hockey appear on screens but do not dominate
Most of the time there is live performances on also there are around 10 flatscreens around the pub playing live football Beer is good and the mood is like in a classic english public house
My Favorite place in Turku  Lovely staffowners and cosy atmosphere 
A standard finnish bar Good place to get drunk
Amazing cocktails they make with their own liquor and the food was just great pub food Staff was fun and the atmosphere of the whole place was relaxing Would definitely recommend this as a bar you must visit when in Turku
Traditional beers location is excellent and great interior
One of the best bars to hang out in town
Local pub nice atmosphere Serve the  normal beverages They have Stand up and some trubadurs there once in a while too Local pub
Hdhdhsjfnx drink gshdhckcnddhf dancing jdjxjsjcjdjd singingI was very very drunk

Irkkutype neighborhood pub summer and autumn terrace ok prices ok service Good location

Ok Matter of fact Good service
Drunk It would need a major renovation
Local pub which support local footballclub Gnistan Dont eat there Drink beer
Friendly neighbourhood bar with a nice summer terrace and a rather rowdy atmosphere Bonus points for a hefty selection of different beers
Really pretty Irish Pub style decoration and the place has a wooden terrace The location is great too its right near Oulunkyl trainstation From the terrace you can watch trains come and go while having a beer or two and a snack if you like Definetely worth a visit
A fraction better traditional local bar where you might spend a whole evening and then wander home behind the corner Atmosphere is golden here especially during karaoke and live gigs  Customers are mainly local regular Joes from younger adults to oldtimers This is a local bar for locals and can be seen from the atmosphere too This place seem to be quite popular for meeting and hang around with friends that might come even longer distances to spend time here or have a get together with mutual interest to certain hobby  Liquid beverages are priced below average which is great for wallet issues Regular lager beer is somewhere around 5 Euros Solid beverages selection is a tad more expensive  starting from 6 Euros Even though solid beverages are a bit more bar snacksoriented the overall selection from both liquid and solid is grand  Atmosphere is golden here during karaoke or live gigs When this place is getting packed its quite noisy and this makes hard to hear if youre next in the queue to karaoke Conversation is also quite hard when this place is full So this venue is not recommend if youre looking for quieter atmosphere  Overall I dont have much things to complain here This isnt by any means a fancy bar Its honest  it doesnt hide its feathers and therefore it shines among other bars in Helsinki for being traditional This establishment is well located next to railway station and bus stops  so coming here is easy even if youre commuting Just visit here if youre looking for the heart and soul of suburb bars This is one those traditional places to visit
Gr8est barnightclub in eastern Helsinki
Five star bar Good place for a beer at the daytime Good place for a beer at the night time too Pretty good selection of beers
This is a very good place to have afterwork beer The interior design is fantastic and wherever you look you can see the art in it
The place is nice the music is good but racist violent security even without the need for violence and very arrogant manager but bartenders was fine
Many pool tables great atmosphere and live music on weekends Along with a wide variety of drinks they even provide some grilled food if a night out or playing billiards makes you hungry
They charge an entry fee after 9 Amazing live music along with many pool tables I believe the top floor has a different music theme
Best place to sing karaoke in town
This is actually a nice place It has biliard it has a certain irish feel to it At least in my opinion Good live bands every now and again
Wonderful place always go here when visiting in Oulu
Sometimes you find a bar you really like This is one of them Great choice of beers games quiet corners and rowdy tables Really good spot
Have not tried any food here but I was impressed with their selection of whisky and beer For fans of Brewdog they have it They also stock Guiness Nitro IPA which is very good too Interior is very plush and there is ample room There is also a blackjack table inside
A nice place to spend the evening Cozy and friendly environment
If you like beer this is definetely a place for you to check Im not sure but I bet they have like more than  one hundred different beers according to their website they have sold total of 1655 different beers You can order just coffee too  thats fine
Decided to drop by on a Sunday night It was not too busy but nice amount of people at bar  Good selection of beer on tap Ended up getting a Porterhouse Nitro Red Ale which was sooo creamy Very tasty beer at a good price
So many craft beers  They put games on tv  No food
great place to stop in oulu and have a big choice of beers
An English style pub with a wide choice of beer The pub has a weird layout and is only really has seating areas for groups of 3 or 4 They have board games and some are in English They also show premier league football The beer is expensive but so is the rest of Finland
A true living room for the locals Fireplace and all
This is a pub near the Oulu market square Several choices of beer beverages and other drinks There is a covered  drinking area with a view to the direction of the market square  Somehow premises dont suit well for well any number of people Its difficult to move inside bar for a free seat and maybe thats why people stay at the bar area This again makes it even more difficult to move or even place an order at the bar There is no table service here
One of the best and most comfy pubs in Finland Excellent selection of whiskeys and great cocktails Fireplace adds a nice touch especially during winter Do not change a thing
This place is so calming and sweet The staff there knows what they are doing and are very professional The athmosphere is amazing too You can describe a drink to the bartender and they will make you the perfect drink that you are sure to love
I wanted a hot beverage Cold glass with mild warm beverage Bartender female was just having some kind of fun with a male customer who did not even buy anything I shall never go again this place
Great staff awesome atmosphere and a cosy place to drink few brewskies or long drinks In summer the sun shines all day to the patio
A chill place to spend a night with friends They offer blankets for cold nights
WOW Teerenpelis own NEIPA New England India Pale Ale is easily the best hazyjuicy IPA Ive tasted in Finland and it would hold up against anything from the US where the style is everywhere   Those who dont normally go for IPAs will find the citrus really softens the flavor and makes it more refreshing
Small menu but the food was great Service was friendly and the whiskey superb
We had an amazing dinner there Staff was nice food was spectacular Will 100 return
Great burger Beer is good tooPlace was not to crowdedso everything went smooth
Probably the best pub in Jyvaskyla in terms of design and architecture The vibe is amazing here quite antique and fancy The beers are ok because its expensive say 910 euro for 033Cc which is higer than any other bars The options in the beers are nice
One of many pubs on a pedestrianized street But it definitely stands out It has street terrace with rain shields and sitting options inside By interior its not a pure Irish pub but by atmosphere and attitude it really is Food Just 2 dishes was tasted  Guinness and Kilkenny I would say that their taste was very close to what I had in Ireland Service Probably the best words to say is unbelieving attention Precise and accurate description of options timely table service positive attitude Price The price is higher than in central or western Europe but its ok within Finland Atmosphere Its not covered with clovers and overwhelming green but its a nice place to have a pint
A really wide selection of beers on tap both local and imported Definitely a place with great vibe which is also very popular with the locals
Nice place to hang out with friends for the evenings after work  great customer friendly environment and the Middle of the city centre you can catch your public bus from the closest bus stops to 35 minutes walking distance 
One of the best Bars in town Nice atmosphere and great drinks You can find boardgames to create activity for your evening or enjoy the music that great DJs are playing I highly recommend visiting this bar
Good selection of beer as always in their baars
A gastropub specializing in local beer cider and whiskey made at the Teerenpeli brewerydistillery in Lahti Its a bit pricy but the sour beers I sampled were tasty and the interior atmosphere is quite cosy Friendly customer service as well
This place has a very interesting selection of beers If you like to experience new tastes i would recommend this place Its a pricey place though Terrace Restrooms Tables inside
Their service in excellent  they speak both English and Finnish
One of my favourite places for a quick beer or a glass of red wine I like watching the passing traffic cars and motorcycles and the the place itself is laid back clean and theres lots of space both indoors and out at the terrace Not a fine place in no means but laid back and welcomes you to have a sip in your comfy shorts Definitely add on your list of places to visit
One of the Jyvskyls best bars if you just want to get the gang together and have a chat over some drinks The staff is mostly agreeable The absolutely best thing about the place is the atmosphere
Jyvskyls unofficial rock bar Beer longhaired people in black clothes flipper machines small concerts exhibits from local artists Located inside a historical old train station
All dishes were extremely delicious They have a fully vegan burger on the list and if you are a fan of burgers tasting their Revolution burger is a must Excellent very friendly service in fully proficient English Special offers eg tacos 10 EUR on some nights Might be a bit crowded but six persons can easily be seated Ask to be on the bar side to watch current sport games on TV also many board games available while waiting for food It was such a great experience we had to have it two nights in a row  kiitos
Apparently we were too loud After they told us to be quiet another party was being loud and we didnt see them being shushed Food was fine but not necessarily worth the price Not coming again
The food Hamburger beef was well made eventhough we ordered medium steaks Other than that it was a good burger Not special but good The bread was OK but the starter shrimps were excellent Staff was friendly  Bar Everybody dances on the tables awesome Its a good party The dj plays quite mixed music not sure if its a good thing Age limit seems quite young so if youre pushing 30 this maybe not your place
To be honest the food was mediocre at best Burger bun and patty were dry and tasteless which ruined the burger  But I wanted to give this place still four stars because of the service The attitude of the server was fantastic which honestly made the visit a lot better
Great place for kids during daytime when its not so crowded Nice ambience and good customer service
Lively party game bar for adults only after 1800
Fun place to go bowling but the staff were very apathetic Our lane glitched out and when we called them to help they rolled their eyes at us and said it was because we were throwing the balls too hard  Later we bought some tokens to try out the arcade machines Half of them were not working I really looked forward to trying out Space Invaders which they advertise on their website but it didnt even exist at the premises  On top of that one of the machines swallowed my friends token At 1 per token that is a pretty expensive glitch  I still had fun and Im glad a place like this exists in Jyvskyl but I feel like its not quite living up to its potential
Decent services good games Its quite dark and cavelike Customers service was mediocre but no face masks in use

Only place to see live football on a hockey game day
Locals small sports pub
Game on
Best karaoke place in kuopio
Ok
Very homely place
Ok
There should be a separate column for sexy male waiters in which case the place would be 65  A warm atmosphere cold drinks and sparkling customer service  this is what living rooms are made of
You cant talk about a very friendly service but maybe our own behavior wasnt very commendable either Its both sides you can get whatever you order
Sometime in 19989 I also lifted a lot of kegs from which to pour beer THE LEVEL HAS DROPPED THIS GUY DOESNT SPEAK ANYTHING GOOD IF KALJA FELL ME MEDIA TIME
I dont really like it Always carrying the same ones there I didnt visit my place a couple of times they werent enough for me

A real neighborhood bar A big plus from live music
On November 4 2022 I bought sausage fries from Prrin Pes and I have to say that without a doubt the best sausage fries Ive ever eaten and really nice staff Big recommendation
If I could give negative stars there would be quite a few If you arrive in the wrong club in the opinion of the staff you will be denied entry even if you are completely eligible in another club I am a restaurateur and I decide about my customers So be it I am a serious customer who spends money and I decide on my bar
Very friendly people and great beer Try the variety there in the shop and buy the best with you
Excellent beer decent prices
Great beer at great location if you want to get out from centre
Best experience ever
Amazing customer service fair prices and immaculate vibes all around
A rude cave full of teenagers who fortunately are not allowed in the more upscale brothels
Really dirty place with sticky floors and always glass shards on the floor You should invest in cleaning and removing glass mugs from use as well as investing in the maintenance of the property
Narikka cost 5 which is quite expensive but of course you can get drinks at half price The selection of drinks is quite limited The surfaces of the place are dirty and sticky and everything is broken Not terribly interested in visiting in the future
Gloomy and dusty old tavern for weary travelers and explorers Excellent place to wind down and relax between you legendary exploits and quests for glory I bet even the exiled royal family of long dead Finnish kings visit here during the bitter winter storms
A lot of room and a nice beer selection Especially a nice variety of Brewdog beers Short walk from the Kuopip bus and train stations
Pub with good selection of beers Also a seasonally changing selection of specialties from small breweries Atmosphere is nice although later in the evening its usually quite crowded In the summer you can enjoy your beer on the terrace which has a beautiful view to the Kuopio Cathedral You can also play boardgames here
One of the best restaurants in whole Finland when it comes to selection of beers Fantastic unique service Also wide range of wines available in upstrairs Definately a place to visit
If local bar is defined as an establishment where customers come in with friends and have good time this bar really is a local bar Most use their liberty and possibility to purchase alcoholic beverages There are two floors underground is not open every day Summer time doubles the number of seats when outdoors terrace on one of towns central pedestrian street is open
Nice environment and cheap beer
Beer bar
Great for cheap drinks
Small and cozy
Good pub athmosphere
A really small and intimate place Sympathetic Good karaoke and atmosphere
If the price level at Lahtis passenger harbor causes a stir thats okay There is even a lake view from the terrace of the Point pub and even the laziest can walk from the harbor to the Point in a few minutes The price level is significantly more down to earth than seaside and its good to sit in the sunshine Fast and good service For driveby situations Point also has a fairly large parking lot as a bar where its easy to turn around Of course I dont encourage driving and slouching so maybe an egg mangel or a foot pedal is still a better option I highly recommend it to a lover of local kapakos
Great place Rude clientelle But the Kindness and cheerfully manners of the owner and his barmaids does make all the difference Higly recomended as a Must go Sports Bar Still the Beat in town year after year
A remarkable piece of nightlife history at the heart of Lahti This place is looking like a timecapsule from the times when things where a bit different And you can smell that history still here because of their fitted carpet and textures  This is remarkable piece of Lahti nightlife history still looking the very same it used to be Everything smells the same when this place used to allow smoking inside I think this smell is coated to the textures of this establishment and its hard to get rid of that  This place is big and used to be the center hub for partying in Lahti and it still sometimes gather young people enough to party like it used shine It may not be the same experience what used to be but it still is a living example of the times when young adults spend more times in the nightclubs than outside  How I feel about this place Its clearly not my place to be thats for sure Everything here feels a bit like a wind from the past  even the service It wasnt bad at all It just had the same feeling like this place has  a bit old and forgotten somehow  Generally speaking this is an easygoing hang around place for young adults Its ok place to be Theres plenty of room and plenty of games of many sorts to spend time with Good views to outside for to look passing meaningful life This place is not for me though  maybe someone else Young adults perhaps
Dive bar with a restless atmosphere and patrons you do not desire to engage in conversation with Has a few pinball games which is a plus
Fun place to hang out  play pinball
This is a pleasant bar on edge of Lahti city center Still it is only a block from the market square and opposite of old bus station There is a decent selection of drinks no food available There are several games a pool table and bingo night events for customers
Cheap beer and friendly atmosphere
Great karhu beer here
Quiet good location
Fair prices good spot If you are under 35yrs this is not your kind of of place
Ok
Normal beer bar in Lahti You can take drinks and snack too
Perfect Great vino  good bartender
A dimly atmospheric bar space Good selection of draft beers
A cozy local bar with karaoke if there are no corona restrictions You can also watch hockey and football games on the TV screens Good deals on drinks in between Event evenings with live music a few times a year for example at Halloween time or in the summer during the terrace times the opening and closing parties of the summer season A few slot machines
Nice little bar The price of the beer is appropriate and the service is friendly The location is a bit hidden and the views from the terrace are a bit grim
A longtime regular customer had to change places when they stopped holding karaoke completely again
Ok
The owner is really friendly Its a pleasure to visit Thank you
The best pint and service in the world
Wasnt Milan 45
This is a very cool cozy and beautiful pub Lovely friendly helpful and welcoming staff Good selections of house beers For the whiskey lover the house whiskeys are a must try item Good music to dance to on Fridavs and Saturdavs If you should visit Lahti Teerenpeli is Its definitely a place to go
Very cozy place Very crowded in the night but still a must when you want to hang out in Lahti Signature sour beers are the best 
Excellent blueberry mojito Bartender was cool too  This place is clean and classy will be coming back for sure 
This is a very cool place The people there are always nice and fun Customer service just super If you should visit Lahti Teerenpeli is definitely a place to go
Great pizzas and nice service There seemed to be a lot of games to play and a wide selection of food
Good food I can do it again On Saturday we visited between 1700 and 1800 there was no rush hour A cozy place
Quite a nice place Small but cozy There are a couple of televisions showing sports You can find a lot of drinks and food
You should have read the reviews beforehand on foodora Hamburgers really dry patties almost no mayonnaise French overripe chickpeas yk The frying oil probably hasnt been changed in a while either because the taste is so bitter Yikes never again
I decided to stop in here while I was exploring the streets of Lahti I was pleasantly surprised by the ambience and environment of the bar The lighting is perfect the seats are comfortable and most importantly the drinks are fantastic Make sure you indulge yourself in one of their fantastic cocktails The young gentlemen with the glasses working behind the bar takes a tremendous amount of pride in his work and creations The cocktails were beautifully prepared and presented
Albert is a fantastic bartender By far the best Old Fashioneds in Lahti at Seurahuone Very courteous service all around Very top notch
Honestly if you want a lounge experience in Lahti that is open until late you cant go wrong with this Front desk is a typical bar setting but the back room has a real living room atmosphere with books board games and good space for small groups to just enjoy their night  Highly recommended especially for those not into nightclubs or partying
An iconic Terrace Caf from Lahti Great bites and cocktails with one of the quickest service
Very cool



Manchester United fans will be happy here since you can watch their games and probably other Premier League games too here Decent selection of local draught beers and cider Bartender was kinda bored though You can sit outside and enjoy the view over the western harbour On my second visit the pub was fairly crowded with locals playing cards Bartender was nice Try Slupp beer Its cheaper here than in the other pubs in Trshavn
Great atmosphere and lovely people We got there Saturday night and the place was packed with people There is a special offer you can drink most of the night unlimited for 100 DKr I really recommend this place
Monkey night All the beer and cider you can drink for 100 Crowns Only Thursdays and Fridays 2000 and 220230
Basically asadvertised  Bunch of dudes sitting around watching football  Beers pretty reasonably priced for the area
Skinny Waitresses prancing around not knowing what service is all about Fish and Chips was not the freshest and the garlic bread is out of this world I mean its not from Earth I think
Food as you can see at the plate in two dough there was no fish in it The one which in it  was too small piece But Salmon Soup was delicious  Service the soup served  in 12 minutes  also  fishchips she served very late  Anyway i believe in a season they have a nice atmospher
That was delicious My friend recommended this place for delicious food for a decent price and its exactly like he said
Nice food Pity they didnt show the GAA football semi final Kerry Vs Derry All TVs had the mens Wimbledon final on
To have a pint of the black stuff to celebrate the St Patricks Day here in Tallinn has been our longstanding tradition This time we decided to visit the Old Irish Pub in Lasname Alas to our shock and disbelieve they do not serve Guinness Yes correct no Guinness in the Irish Pub Do not get me wrong the pub itself was nice pretty decent food but it just has nothing to do with the true Irish stuff
This place has nothing to do with Ireland The only Irish thing it has is Jameson and thats about it
What a nice place to visit I was many years ago in this place but it was totally different Now its so much better food is tasty staff is very polite and professional Life music and great atmosphere
Best place in Lasnamae to have a snack brunch or a drink Gonna come over and over
Nice place with interesting interior Food came fast and it was average Toilets were interesting also There was really good live music Near to city center
Everything is fine but keep in mind that the receipt will be 20 more since the prices in the menu are without VAT
Now this is the place where you can pay Old Town prices without actually being in Old Town  05l of basic national lager for 7EUR Used to go there every now and then for great atmosphere and reasonable prices but after their last price hike  I vote with my wallet and say Adieu Scotland Yard
Fantastic bar with superior interior design Everything is so well thought out We came to celebrate my partners birthday and were looked after real good Food was exceptional I had the salmon with cream cheese baked potato and it was fantastic All the flavors went so well together I forgot our servers name but Reelika who I presume is the shift manager was very kind and welcoming Definitely recommend to everyone
Its a very nice place nice decoration apart from the English guys who drink to death and pee with open Toilette door
Super cozy place warm atmosphere lots of romantic lights You can also order different kinds of meals here drinks Its possible to use playstation Place where hygiene is high level  hand sanitizers clean lavatory recommendations to sanitize your hands Place where you can talk its not so loud Beautiful style of the interior
Amazing place with cozy atmosphere Looks like you can do anything you might like there we saw people doing a round in Playstation playing darts and cards And drinking for sure They have great cider but the cherry  beer was my favourite Its a small place so it might be crowded and you need to be there at good time to have seats but youll love it
Probably my go to pub when I want a beer The drinks are cheap the atmosphere is nice and its a nice place to get to know other people  If youre a smoker the smoking room is a great feature so you dont have to leave the pub and freeze to death in the winter
Lovely little underground pub Never would have found it in my own but very glad my local friends took me there Good atmosphere and we had a nice secluded area at the back Nice selection of beers and drinks Really tasty pub food and I had a really nice vegan burger am veggie but appreciate the option Will go back again definitely worth a visit
Big fan of the atmosphere my favourite pub in Tallinn Friendly service and great place to spend time with friends
Absolutely great food  who wouldve thought that pub food is made with such attention to detail  and so delicious Try the cheese balls the goat cheese salad The pulled salmon the cheese wiener schnitzel All so tasty New favorite Amazingly nice staff
A small cozy pub that has an owner with a huge heart Would recommend wholeheartedly
Food  drinks was decent and hearty the interior and atmosphere were charming but i have to talk about our serverwaitress Diani apologies for any spelling error who was actually smiling with teeth A rare phenomenon in Tallinn and was very helpful and patient I hope you continue to smile like that and that it spreads to others Be well
Outstanding experience with well priced food that was spectacular  The borscht was as good as my grandmas and over the schnitzel  Best find ever with incredible staff
We were 12 day in Tallinn on our way to Canada and stopped at this pub with kids for dinner The food was excellent and not expensive compared to prices in Canada We ordered schnitzel pork ribs and chicken All portions were large and delicious The service was great Thank you the owner the servers and the chief We would visit the place again next year BTW I recommended this pub to my friend He was there today and is very satisfied
My first time Vana Villem was in 2015 and I had a great experience Then I had the pleasure to return now in October 22 and I really enjoyed my second time here Really great service from beginning to the end polite friendly and attentive waitress gorgeous food  please pass this to the chefs good price big portions excellent pint of Guinness and fantastic atmosphere Great place for working lunch dinning or just hang out with friends for a drink I really recommend and I will be back soon
A pub Not Irish Cricket not hurling on one screen and some football of the non Gaelic variety on the other At least the beer was cold Would have stayed for another pint but they started playing James Blunt so we had to leave Not a single Irish song played while we were there not even The Cranberries never mind Wolfe Tones Get it sorted
Great place nice ambiance and great collection of alcohols A small cozy pub right next to the viru gate gate to the Oldtown providing warm service and alcohol They are open for long time everyday  I will recommend this place for travellers and the locals
Im not a fan of karaoke bars but I had a great time at this place
I gave 5 stars for food because drinks wasnt an opinion The atmosphere depends on who is singing sometimes they rock and sometimes they suck big time But I love the place
Had a great sea bram very tasty Good sitting outside in the old town Unfortunately the nice waitress didnt seem to have time to clean the tables When youre not in a hurry a nice place
I had a disappointing experience at this restaurant The slow service was frustrating and to my surprise a mandatory 20 tip was added to the bill without any prior inquiry The menu was limited and only a handful of dishes were available The beef in the stew was incredibly tough resembling the sole of a shoe rather than a culinary delight but the sauce was ok It wasnt until I used a dictionary later that I understood the confusing items on the bill but by then I was already far from the location  I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone seeking a pleasant dining experience
Been there twice and both times the service was great Had the gourmet burger which was really tasty and fresh It came with fries Atmosphere is more like a fancy bar than a pub Definitely going back for the burger
Good view and delicious food Small portions about 18 beef in picture top side for high prices Long wait for foodservice despite restaurant being only half full
Good food Interior is so so Beer selection is different from their website and limited
Really nice place to catch up for drinks and beers  Interesting craft beers  and a good menu Several dishes are perfect to share 
What goes well with beer Fried pigs ears of course These are well seasoned here in Beer Garden Tallinn Deeeeelicious snack Highly recommended 
As a person who doesnt like beer this place actually surprised me with the variety of cocktails and this is one of those places where me and my beer drinking friends can both enjoy food and drinks
Well if they want to sell bottled water and explain that you cant drink tap water in Tallinn old town I would not preciate that Would you Garlic bread really nice anyways
my order came 20 minutes after everyone else is this a salad for you Its not even a ONE pickle
Amazingly is a tourist place with affordable prices and a reasonable quality We ordered several dishes and all of them achieved our expectations the burgers are really good them are 6 for example and a cheese plate is 35  The only issue we had there is that the waiter doesnt know English at all so we needed to act a little to be understood 
Good food and good price around 9 for a plate The service was not  super friendly The room was a bit loud  Kiev Kotelet is really good The BBQ pork is great  Karja Kelder is the oldest pub in Tallinn Politicians used to meet there in secret to restore Estonia independence
Fantastic pub in Tallinn The waiter are amazing I really recommend this place I watch all the time F1 The bill is well proportionately 5 for 500ml of beer  1 liter 10 You can also play at fantastic games like chess   backgammon and so on I recommend this place if you like the atmosphere of football f1 and sport like this
Being for a weekend in Estonia I called and reserved a table for a specific Bundesliga match Dortmund  Wolfsburg which was promised to be broadcasted When arrived a bartender tried to turn it on though faced tech issues on all screens and didnt move to resolve We left completely disappointed as missed the game
The worst service and bang for the buck factor in Tallinn The waitress was either off her meds or on some drugs as she started screaming and calling me an idiot when asked if 1eur toilet applies if you buy drinks it does  This is ridiculous how bad that place and service are
Ok bar probably really busy when the football is on
Went here for some beers and quick food and was very happy with my visit Their own beers were good and the starters I chose where huge in size and great in taste Seemed like a very cool local bar will go back again next time im in town 
Excellent pub with good looking interiors and a big green terrace for the summer Fast and nice service food was good and in good quantity ample beer selection and reasonable pricing Plenty of locals which is usually a good sign Much recommended spicy mushrooms soup
Great spot for drinks First time trying Estonian craft beer Definitely worth checking out when in Tallinn I asked the bartender for a surprise shot and he made this yummy limoncello based drink with Tabasco Youll have to try it for yourself
My favorite beer place in Tallinn By far Ive been there 3 times during my 5 days visit  They have amazing beer selection   I mainly tried high alcohol beers and loved all of them Must visit
Authentic bar very cool bartender Nice atmosphere cheap prices
Cheap beer very authentic Not for the fancy pants

Best Wienersnitzel ever juicy inside  crispy outside The burger was tasty but the bun didnt stay together Our waitress was terrific and friendly It was nice to sit out and enjoy people watching
This place is good for cocktails and drinks Cheaper than the place opposite Not the same atmosphere but cheaper for drinks which is a win for me You can watch the world go by from here too Didnt have food here but the prices were much more reasonable than nearby establishments
Great location reasonable prices perfect service even on a busy evening We returned to this place the next day of our stay because we loved everything about this place They has the Christmas special menu and we ordered the steak Beers were also great Definitely recommend 
Awesome place with awesome prices and awesome staff Wont look any further next time Im hungry in Tallinn The garlic potatoes are to die for
Lovely environment music is not too loud so you can have decent conversations
Good alternative to Valli Baar another legendary pub closeby from bygone era Beer is dirt cheap and warm you get what you pay for customers are jolly and retro music is coming from the speakers Can feel a bit cramped in there and if youre nonsmoker like me  you might struggle a bit Hence the star off But places like these need all the support they can get so Ill definitely will visit them again
Quite a nice bar overall A small problem is that people smoke inside Sadly the barmaid who is also an owner has a problem with a louder than average voices Paying for drinks while getting shouted at should not be there Dont expect pub style merry vibe there but a bit depressive quiet vibe
Rustic with local regulars but man theyre smoking in there and its a small pub
Nice bar with a view on the runway regular airport prices rude staff first hiding from us to text the being very abrupt when we ordered that kills the vibe In a bar service is 80 of success independent of whether its in the city centre or on the airport
We were stuck in the airport for 16 or so hours with flight after flight being cancelled due to bad weather I can thank this little bar for keeping us sane during this inconvenience Great service cosy seating and decent beer
We ordered bratwurst Got them totally cold just burned in both ends Never eat there
Incredibly rude staff The website says enjoy while watching one of the many sports channels available but nothing was on When we asked if it was possible to change the channel she didnt want to talk to us and just said no I continued to ask and she said she wasnt interested in sports acted very angry and said that she didnt actually work there Just not acceptable to talk to guestspeople in that way
We booked a table for  10 ppl We ordered drinks and snacks Everything came rather fast the service was friendly and fast The food was fine no problems with drinks either The interior of the place is pleasant  modern and with an artistic touch The best part of this place is its location  right on the beach with an Amazing sea view The also have a beautiful wooden terrace I can definitely recommend this place
Place itself looks very nice and fresh Right next to the sea and with good weather is probably a very nice experience  Unfortunately the food was average We were served crepes sweet with red caviar In Russian restaurant you should get proper small pancakes with red caviar not crepes Okroshka was also decent not the best Ive had  Service was slow and seemed to be understaffed as the waitress was super busy taking our order
one of the most desirable neighborhoods in all of Tallinn breathtaking view of the sea a relaxing atmosphere and mouthwatering fare are just some of the benefits of dining here If you wanted to take your family or some friends out to a nice restaurant for lunch or dinner this establishment would be among the best options available to you
During my brothers visit to Estonia for my graduation we dined at this restaurant that made a lasting impression on us The first thing that caught our attention was the captivating atmosphere situated near the seaside The gentle breeze and refreshing sea air created a delightful ambiance throughout the entire restaurant Moreover the food was not only delicious but also served by incredibly friendly staff members
Nice nostalgial place friendly service and okay food for pub Drinks selection was small for my liking for a pub
Ate lunch here Craft beer selection was a bit weak Few draft beers The loaded fries were huge seljanka 5e was cheap and big portion and the expensive 20e lamb was good Avoid the schnitzels
This is a classic looking pub on one of the main streets of Tartu Well priced honest food reasonable selection of beers  We visited with 3 adults and 3 relatively young kids had dinner and a drink  What stood out was the service  the young gentleman serving our table was quick friendly and almost unEstonian in being proactive  Overall  good for grabbing a beer with the guys and having some food
Overall good place Sweet potatoe fries were little soggy Other than that the burger was good and I liked the lime sauce
If you are vegan the coice for you is very poor No plantbased milk for coffe and the inly meal was a pasta with vegetables But I would not call them vegetables Its only freezed vegs And can food No good for your stommach 
The pub was full have to wait 10 min but it was worth it The food was delicious service was fast even tho staff told us that it may take 45min There is a kid play corner with toys and slide Ordered garlick bread For us it was funny that they brought us garlick and bread Ofcourse garlic was just a decor Before Lunch we were at Ahaa so we had entry tickets on wrist got 10 discount
Good service and good food Good prices Great atmosphere Remote control to call service Unique interior design
After a long pleasant bus ride this was definitely a nice stop I havent been here before but there are good wienerschnitzels here The design is also pretty comfy two floors too
This place is related to punk rock So if you like slamming fire and have a passion for this kind of music  youll be very welcome
Nice gigs too few nonalcohol options in the bar lousy speakers
The only rock club venue  in Tartu Usually nice people in there only taking the star off because of lack of drinks in there You get your usual Saku but no crafty staff which is a shame
A legendary venue that never seems to disappoint
Awesome atmosphere quite a few choices in the menu delicious food that looks great and every drink choice is worth trying I highly recommend this place If youre not a fan of loud places and live music then I still recommend to return some other timedayevening as everything else is still worth it
Loved the vibe of the place Food tasted delicious and it looked more like restaurant serving than pub Service personnel was fantastic I definitely recommend to dine in there
Great location Tasty food Nice pub interior Place to enjoy night and watch football
Great pasta Would definitely return 
Great atmosphere We randomly got a concert night which was pleasant surprise The waitress was absolutely wonderful Keep up with her good work The food was good Ive had only vegetarian dishes which were very good especially the grilled dumplings Plenty of beers to choose from Highly recommend
I was about to rate 4 Stars but it is not fair to blame this Pub for my bad planning Speed of Service was the only problem I had but I should have been prepared for the European style of dining  Ambience is what impresses you as soon as you walk in I read that this Pub is 300 years old and I didnt have any trouble believing it The brickwalls ceiling decor etc all give an Old World feel I ordered a couple of items from the Snacks section and 1 soup in a Bread Bowl and everything tasted really good  Soup itself was very filling so I ended packing the Snacks
The place is absolutelly gorgeous and worth the visit According to our tour guide is the only place in Tartu where you can eat some typical Estonian dishes The food was good but it did not surprise us For example the soup inside the bead was good but the bead itself was gummy and tasteless The warm vegetables salad was very tasty and we liked it a lot Keep in mind that they dont cook main cojrses after 9PM so even if it is 903PM you wont be able to make your order
We had dinner and it was an incredible experienceThe service was very nice and the main course pork ribs were delicious and the house beer too Totally recommended I attach some fotos to have an idea 
A night club that doesnt say anything in my jail
Normal place and good service


Very nice trendy bar Service is fast and highquality The bar interior looks super cool and the party atmosphere is on point
Very modern and engaging bar The atmosphere and interior design is amazing and original indeed an experience on its own The staff is friendly and cares about the customers The menu is varied and the drinks I tried were very tasty
A new place where you can have a night long dance off with your friends Drinks are good and reasonably priced They really made the neon scene work and it fits the place perfectly Loved the staff always smiley and happy to serve you
Great new place They just opened so theyre learning from their new customers how to tailor the service and overall create a pleasant experience Try it
18 inside when its 33 outside cheap beer and food and very good quality Soup 2EUR Daily meal 4EUR 11001500 Beer 445EUR castle nearby and river as well worth to try out especially in summer Highly recommend to visit
Great place to visit Prices are ok and food is tasty Staff is friendly and helpful as well Regarding the menu Ive ordered Pork chop Spanish style 750 UR  Fried potatoes with  vegetables 250 EUR Pork in a rural way Fried pork with a rural potato a cranberry and fresh vegetables 100 EUR Chicken nuggets with potatoes 500 EUR
Moldy smell Russian language only Food wasnt as great as I expected from other reviews Really dated No one was there except us and it still wasnt great Severely disappointed Bathroom was rough But on the plus side tried Salo for the first time but didnt like it
Nice place if you want to get away from abundant dancing parties on Saturday night Food is available even at 1130pm beer is served cards are accepted
There is no card payment and therefore the establishment may be evading taxes and serving not the best alcohol There is a terrible smell in the room due to lack of ventilation be prepared for your clothes to be saturated with the smell of smoke for several days
I liked it very much All of our company
Alcohol is excellent at 5
Quiet place
Beers are good prices and some good tunes playing when we stopped by
Food is pretty OK one thing what didnt like was that service was only in Russian language although Narva is part of Estonia
Very fast service and atmosphere but I disliked the fact that someone was smoking inside
Best pub food on its price
I was with my partner and stopped by while passing through He took the burger and said it was delicious I took the classic Caesar with chicken and the salad was a bit dry the cheese was very strange and tasteless and the capers werent very good We took more lemonade mine turned out to be tastier that is richer in taste But this is the only normal place in tiny Ivangorod so you can tolerate some shortcomings And so normal guys gather in this pub and have a cultural rest the owner knows many of them as far as I understand All the best to you
Mom be sure to write a good review Everything here is delicious We were in Ivangorod at the weekend we went to this place for lunch Selected based on online reviews Clean comfortable delicious great service I liked everything we recommend The child said that now this is one of his favorite restaurants
The Pub has friendly and attentive staff an excellent menu for every taste A very atmospheric establishment I recommend to everyone Probably the best place in town
Went for lunch really enjoyed it Despite the fact that the menu had several positions on the foot Polite and friendly great atmosphere
Tere  Hi Ma Olen Inglana  Ive been coming to Parnu now for 5 years and never eaten at BumBum untill this week  Ive had 2 lovely meals here  good clean fresh well presented good portion sizes and very tasty food  The beer  and the coffee was great too  good service and very fairly priced too 7 for a meal Eat inside or outside  2 eating areas one either side of the building so always check both sides if you want to eat outside  Head Isu 
The food was great the service was fast and friendly too  We had the Bum Bum and it was really good Kind of like a pork chop our schnitzel on a bed of small tender potatoes topped with grilled onions and some sort of really good cheese  All together the food was excellent and the prices very reasonable  The weather was great so we dined on the large party as were most of the other parties that we there  A perfect evening to a great day off traveling thru a great little country Estonia
Quite lovely stop over for a beer Make sure its over 25 degrees if youre out in the summer terass or the Scandinavian weather will take its toll Beer A Le Coq 35 
No doubt i will return here again next time i visit city Tasty dishes great portions fair prices
Great selection of alcohol and great service A nice place to go with pets
A summer chill place and the bar lady is very kind
A nice new place to relax and drink beer
Good to go swimming
Excellent restaurant very reasonable prices friendly and welcoming staff absolutely delicious food that leaves you satisfied not to mention the great selection of beer Its precisely the kind of restaurant that immerses you in the Estonian world creating wonderful first impressions I really enjoyed signing our names on their map sending greetings from Braov Romania
Ive been coming to Parnu for several years for spa breaks mostly and only now I discovered this wonderful rustic beer pub It has a great selection beers and other drinks theres a lovely atmosphere very friendly staff and so far good music which is not so easy to find nowadays Its close to the main street of Parnu Old Town Kuninga Street but its kind of hidden away in one of the courtyards Didnt try food this time but next time I will
Great place for a beer and simple food The owner is very friendly for a chat  Great way enjoy your stay in Prnu
Nice place kind of nostalgic friendly staff and good beers
If you wanna experience real EstoniaPrnu nightlife then This is the place to be
Delicious Fried Kringel and raisin buns Nice service nice atmosphere
Theeee  best bar of the continent
Since life has taken me abroad I rarely visit my hometown Prnu In the few days when I got home I went to as many hotspots as possible in the summer capital and I have to say that Krhva was the one with the best service atmosphere music selection and cocktails I would give 6 stars if I could these are not the boring rum cokes you get there Alice was the best
Stopped in for a late lunch combo plate and Vegas burger Food was well prepared generous in size and tasty Ordered burger rare and it arrived perfect Large beer 70cl Comes in frozen mug  Our waitress was also absolutely great  Only slight drawback was the combo plate didnt come on a hot plate sadly resulting in cold food very quickly Also missed hotsause andor bbqsauce  saltpepper on the table ketchup was provided but also I didnt ask for it so that one is on me
Amazing and very delicious food Outstanding quality and should be included for every one in his daily menu specially tourist
Wow we have best ever ribs and amazing pulled pork piza also honey wings were a joy for kids 
The food was excellent It took 45 minutes to get the food if it was a maximum of 30 minutes I would give 5 stars the New York cheesecake was the crowning glory of good food I recommend its worth a visit
friend did not make it out in one piece
If you want to meet a drunk girl or man for one night and then you wont recognize each other Youre in this shithole Fights are often ordered here BAR FOR GIVING PACKS
Do you have any problems Come and in this place you will receive them A great place for a night fight Not a single taxi company sends its cars to this hole ie you simply wont leave there I think this is a sufficient indicator But the local scum and rednecks really like it here
All the scum of the city gather in this beautiful place



Draft Guinnes came out as a glass full of warm foam and the lovely waitress had no problem serving it to me and charging it too  The choice of beers is not too rich and the interior and exterior are a bit too worn out for my taste However it seems to be a popular place
Super
Nice and cozy place to hang out in Viljandi especially at night popular place for hipsters Has a nice inside yard also Because of its popularity tends to be crowded
Good prices great people More hipstery place lots of university students Good parties Has a yard with seating area and ping pong table
Nothing special Our server was just a trainee so we did not get the proper service a person usually expects  there were even no napkins on the table The food was average although some of the dishes looked real nice
Delicious food  great service and reasonable price  Very nice  location  straight in the city main area  Highly recommend 
Very high prices for food that is just ok Great service Playlist is comprised of music you would hear at a gym
Decent choice of gluten and lactose free options Everything tastes great and a nice atmosphere Prices also quite fair
Love this place it has nurtured and supported some major players in the Estonian music scene
The longestrunning barrock club in Estonia welcomed us exceptionally well Despite Rakvere being quite a small town the rock club itself was very clean and organised every corner had something unique and the stage lights as well as the sound were simply spot on Highly recommended for gigs
Fantastic place to spend time during the late hours There is not much you can eat but the drinks come at an affordable price There is a tablefootball and pool table inside which is very cheap to play  The crowd consists of Finnish and Estonian people There is a hint that the bar is very supportive of the local motorcycle club and during my time there I even saw one hangaround of the Rakvere chapter
Coca cola 250ml was 1 so overall very affordable Pub is downstairs and has a fairly low ceiling There is a very small live stage and a pool table downstairs  The pub was quiet at 9 PM on a Friday but towards 11 PM it started getting crowded
If you find yourself on the Stroget I highly recommend popping in here for lunch  The food was great  Fish and chips were a little bland but the Irish stew and the guinness meat pie were absolutely amazing  The meat pie was a bit like a stew but I would eat it again in a heartbeat  Service was good and everyone was friendly   Inside the pub was beautiful but sitting outside enjoying the weather and the culture and just watching the world go by was great  Definitely worth stopping in for a bite
Very interesting and crowded bar Food and drinks were tasty Recommended
Decent Irish Bar right in the main shopping area of Copenhagen I just nipped in for a Guinness 72 DKK or about 840 Food menu looked good Bar is popular and seating outside quickly fills up but plenty of room inside
AN AMAZING PLACE My pitstop every time I am In Copenhagen   Staff is amazing food is SUPER delicious and the open view is refreshing or if you want that musky Pub Vibe the inside has an amazing Wood interior design that makes it feel true to its Pub calling
Best Irish pub in Copenhagen Guinness the best the city has to offer staff very friendly
Is like any other Irish Bar nice atmosphere and good mood
Great pub friendly staff good Guinnessand IPAs footballs on the TV and a basement room with a pool table Older crowd which I love Closest thing Ive found in KBH to back home A
Friendly people Decent selection of Irish beers They show most PL matches They have two TVs and can show two different matches at once I go here to see Leeds lose against all kinds of teams
Decent food while waiting for a flight but the nachos I ordered barely had any cheese on it  Wanted a hot drink but was told they didnt serve any
We came in for 15 min no body cleaned the table I did myself The girl at the bar wasing glasses and the same time pores the beerswall the water from gloves goes into the glass   we ordered hot dogs and chicken stripes and we wait 40 min for food  and was disaster the place was warmer than hallway
Place is so miss managed sure none of the personnel here have any experience Ordered nachos and cheese hardly any cheese and a hot dog was stone cold Total waste of money as for 2 drinks and above mentioned food cost near 40 Defo find another place
Went at 11am excellent staff service ans atmosphere We got breakfast bagels hamburgers and fries  it wasnt magic The bagels were hot and cold and fries way too salty Not great for the price but still enjoyed relaxing here Food can be improved although understandable at this time of day
If you are looking for a nice quiet pub  this is the place for you The atmosphere was just too dull for me and not a lot of Irish beers or snacks on offer
Great pub near the Copenhagen central station Friendly service and all youd expect from an Irish bar It appeared to be a Manchester City supporters bar Nowhere is perfect I guess
Great spot for draft and craft beers Nice atmosphere and plenty of room to sit They checkout took rather long as it took a while for the bartender to select all the beers of the people in front of me and ourselves and then to pay For the rest it was a great experience There were also pub games downstairs
We had a fantastic time here Really great atmosphere nice selection of drinks and alcohol og reasonable prices 55 will come back
We went there on our 1st night In Copenhagen We met 2 interesting dudes right off and had a great time drinking  chatting all night
Very good beers as well as a wide selection of other alcohols their food is good too The decor is nothing like other Irish pubs I have been to It is clean classy and does not feel like a trashy pub where people go to get wasted Highly recommend
What a pub Delicious food and great pints Brian and his team made us feel so welcome We had the best craic with them A highlight of our visit to Copenhagen Thanks guys 
Its an Irish pub until all the televisions come on loud for football Football is not the reason one seeks out the atmosphere of an Irish pub The service was very slow Couldnt get served at the bar one person serving because our food was going cold while we waited Floor service disappeared once the football started So in the end we left without getting more drinks  The food was very good Tasty good sized portions That didnt disappoint  The bar itself is very well designed cosy and welcoming  I would recommend it on a day there are not things on the television
friendly staff with Cosy atmosphere its very good place for relaxing Most importantly small talks are possible there
The guards at this pub are racist They would let my white friends in at the age of 21  When i showrd my id black men they rejected me snd tolde me the age limit is 23 They would not give me a valud reason and rejected me of my age Even though they let my white friends in at the age of 21 Ive put the picture of the two guards Never go to this bar if you wanted to be treated fairly
Amazing place The bartender gave a different look when I asked for nonalcoholic beer  Then he told me this is the first nonalcoholic beer we are selling I felt I am different  The bar has good service and collections of drinks Like the interior design of the bar
I didnt get any food  That said I had a total blast here drank good beers and made friends with people from 5 different countries The service was great and the atmosphere was exactly what I needed
Summary Racist Disappointed to say that the establishment exhibited racist profiling at the door The bouncer shockingly admitted to essentially having quotas of the number of black and brown customers they could allow at a time Some of the worst treatment of customers weve seen in all of Copenhagen
Sexist policy of letting people in My male friend with denim shorts wasnt let in because he had shorts And after that two other males were let in with shorts by no problem
Was told I wasnt allowed in because I have tattoos how ridiculous Ive never started trouble in a bar in my life and Im being judged for having tattoos When I asked the bouncer about the ridiculous rule by the way he had tattoos he said it was the owners rules Not cool Stay away
Good vibe and variety of drinks average ok music The DJ that night repeated too many times the same music
Nice place but the annoying blond bartender with black hairband and I think ruined my evening Me and my friend just ordered a cocktail and she told us right away to move somewhere else and not talk in the bar seriously We barely had a zip on our drink geez Ive been to hundreds of bars and clubs in my life and never experienced this Stay out of this place if u want good service The people in the club are allright though and the other bartenders
Seems solid not full when I went but was told later its a top spot for Copenhageners to hang in the younger age groups people in their 20s maybe above and below as well Decent bar would explore again another time when theres more happening or go there with a friend no question
DO NOT ENTER this place is 100 false advertisment They play loud pop music and dont have half of the items on the menu This is not old not Irish and not a pub  Go to one of the good cosy beer bars instead
AVOID at all costs for your safety  DISGUSTING place Security staff harmful towards women Do not go in there Ruined my two night trip with friends Manhandled I have footage which I will be passing on to the police
We had a lot of fun in this club When we arrived there was good live music they were pretty good and got the  people in a good mood The music that was played by the DJ was mixed they also played some good RnB Hip Hop and Afro Beats too We didnt have to wait too long for the drinks thats a big plus So we could enjoy to the fullest
Literally so fun We went on a Monday and had a great time Security was awesome and on top of it Felt very safe  A danish man said that Tuesday was American night I went then and did not enjoy it People were rude and were pushing me around  It was SO crowded  I would recommend going ANY time but then
Went here twice and the first time was amazing and cannot complain the second time unfortunately was not as good The food was good but the fried mushrooms on my burger were fridge cold They did offer to change an appologised but I wasnt waiting again If this had not happened it would have been a straight 5 stars
Friendly stuff Carlsberg was amazing  Music is kinda funny but its giving  teen vibes  Reminded me of my teen days haha
We ate fish and chip its delicious but there was a garlic mayonesse with it It was very very delicious Service price and atmosphere is also very good We came with our baby and he ate meatballs and potato soup he liked it  thank u for everything
I enjoyed the food the drink and the place I must say it was pricey tho Fish and chips  2 beers was 290 dkk Also the portion of the meal was big for me so if you are a small eater you can easily share with a friend
we were glad to have found this amazing speakeasy in Nyhavn We almost didnt go to a different place to hangout in the evening because the food and drinks were great and very affordable the staff were really friendly and nice The place was very cozy and they are open until 0200 so we hangout here every evening when we were in Copenhagen I highly recommend them
I thought this could be a tourist trap but the location is beautiful Its not a tourist trap We had fish and chips there were small and medium I believe small will be my choice next time The fish was good and white The dipping sauce tasted good from garlic and the chips were deliciously crisp Price ok Service though they were busy were attentive
Small bar for Copenhagen but definitely better than the rest It is like a museum inside and an older crowd which is great You can sit at a table and enjoy a drink or stand up and dance The drinks are cheap too
I have never experienced such a rude and careless manager with no sense for customer service decency and respect for other humans I went op to kindly tell the manager that their Grimbergen Blonde has gone severely bad It tasted rotten metallic had no foam almost no gas and the colour of the beer didnt look like a normal Grimbergen Blonde Several of my friends tasted it and had the exact same experience and opinion Instead of listening and acknowledging my and my freinds experience he denied that anything could be bad with the beer and got super aggressive and mad at me for having the audacity to tell him that their beer has gone bad  So please dont drink their Grimbergen Blonde and probably any other of their beers that is not Carlsberg or Tuborg And please go to any other bar in the surrounding instead that has some decent and good people behind the bar
Extremely dismissve and rude bartender today 1107 at 13  we went in for a cheap beer and the bartender didnt accept online ID Swedish ID  we are 23 and 27 Bartender just ignored us and didnt reply This is service industry and we should still be respected as potential customers Do not recommend if youre young they made us feel very unwelcome
Beware of this bar Lots of thieves It will completely change your point of view about Copenhagen  There are guards and CCTVs but thats it Useless
Perfect destination to arrive at around midnight Party in full swing large dance floor Dj smoke cannons and even colored bubble cannons Quite expensive through
Like the other oip tbh
More staff iare needed and this cannot be a Irish pub given the watered down Guinness
Had a Bad Experience by showing discrimination on foreigners and we are not even allowed inside and not at all worth going to this pub
Celebrate my friends bday We enjoyed it alot The crowd is fun and the bar tenders are quite fast in making the orders
went here with a couple of friends and didnt want then to enter we were a group of guys and girls and for whatever reason they didnt want two of the girls that were in our group to enter the bar no reason no justification just said to us that they cannot enter obviously we just stormed off and will never come here again ever again
The worst service i have experienced in my entire life I signed up for karaoke waited an hour the system shot down and I asked when Im on  I was told my slot was deleted Then they threatened me by security NEVER GO HERE EVER if you want to have a decent night Absolutely horrible I am traumatised
Another nice place ruined by a bad bouncer Got told that my friends could not enter then got pushed out roughly and by force in the street Sure it is your place you can decide who gets in and who doesnt but there is a better way of doing it
nice traditional pub Great to find in the area whilst working locally
A nice friendly relaxing welllocated fairly priced pub The smokers have a special area so the air is fairly fresh
Good food good beer and great service
Was there awhile ago from England  Lovely food drink and atmosphere  Very friendly
Very nice place for lunch in nyhvan port nice service and environmentit has firewarm place for cold weather highly recommended
Cozy bar Bartender was very nice I am giving 4 stars because I thought the music inside was very boring I was actually falling asleep and the alcohol didnt help
Cool place to take a break during this cold season in copenhagen They also serve food if you want to
They managed to serve craft sour tuborg classic and sour grimbergen A waiter said its ok
Cosy and amazing English pub in Frederiskberg I loved the ambience quality of service and all the trinkets in there  It combines the English pub vibe and Copenhagen vibe very well I went during the afternoon after lunch and to watch a match There were not so many people  I ordered the pepper steak and the waiter decided to throw away the takeaway portion Even after asking for a takeaway her offer was to have dessert yet had to pay for it Absolutely hated it
The food was superb Not too expensive considering that its right in the middle of Frederiksberg Im giving it 4 stars just because we had to wait quite a long time about 4045 minutes but I recommend it anyways and I will definitely come back because the waiter was also super nice
It was really surprisingly good I was expecting a tourist bar you know the kind but was a cosy place to grab food and some different beers Dunno why they call it London Pub though Wasnt at all Londony
The food here was absolutely amazing I traveled here from the United States and came here for my birthday dinner This might have been the best meal Ive ever had I highly recommend the fish Also be sure to get the Semifreddo for desert Good beer good atmosphere and good staff as well 1010 recommend
One of the first places I went to when I was around 18 The place is decent and most people will be let in  While everyone is welcome the place is mostly Higschoolers 1721 years and supposedly the goto bar for the Royal Guard when theyre not on duty
At this place you might meet some different kinds of characters When I was here there was a big suit gang Wall street style But dont worry I was not underdressed  The vibe can be nice the dj could not really decide on a vibe all kinds of music totally mixed up haha The shots here are cheap Recommend
After visiting two more times I am disappointed Its long queue for beer and bartenders just ignoring customers They just talk to their friends If you love wasting your time in a queue this bar is perfect for wasting your time
Fantastic should come here people ni w x city great
Awesome place The staff is very kind They have a variety of drinks including fernet  Also the burgers are very good
Me and my mate had a beer Paid 57dkk for a 04L tuborg classic My friend also ordered Crispy Fries that were soggy and were served in a cardboard box with ketchup in a small plastic container But they were showing a football game we enjoyed
Very cool place Truly a little Irish embassy in the heart of Aarhus A vast selection of fine spirits and for the truly discerning drinker you can even rent a locker to keep a bottle or three of your own private reserve so it is waiting for you when you visit
Absolutely five stars and a plus for the kind and professional service Whiskey sour was top notch steak as ordered and bloody decent size not to say big Seasoned less than more to allow your inner steak lover to adjust it as you want Free coffee above all else Chips and the sauce were just as good Highly recommended Will come back Definitely
Great beer amazing service Very friendly Would definitely come back again even if just to taste the Christmas beers
We had a Gin and Tonic and Southern Comfort The girl in the bar didnt know what Southern Comfort was and had trubble making s Gin and Tonic The result was okay but not more She must have been new on the job  Nice place with a lot of people Seems to be popular
This is a good place to spend some hours when in Aarhus Nice place where you can both enjoy some sports on tv or just have a beer with some friends and at really fair prices
Great time at this bar Cheap beer through out the week and youll meet a lovely bunch of people
Cheap and friendly place Also has a hidden garden area at the back
Very sweet owner and barmaid not to mention the cheap prices and the cozy atmosphere Check out the little  backyard garden during summer
Really nice and cozy place  Friendly atmosphere and a lovely little garden to enjoy 
Cheapest beer in town Authentic atmosphere
Best atmosphere all the time
Was enjoyable Except the smoke But if you dont smoke just dont go there The tables were also pretty sticky But arent they always in a pub 
Nice place with ok service Wish it was smoke free
Lively pub but very smokey Id forgotten what it was like Since the smoking ban in the uk weve got used to not smelling like an ash try after a night out
Oldschool Danish pub Nothing much to say about it other than this is as old school as it gets
Regular Users Nice behavior No noisy Music
Very nice local bar 
Pretty straight forward
Friendly staff drunk patrons good atmosphere
Very rude and immature staff  I entered about 20 minutes before my friends I sang one karaoke song Then a female bartender came to my table and commanded me to buy a drink right here right now Or else she was going to throw me out of The Golden Lion I was chocked  I told her that I was going to buy drinks but that I was waiting for my friends You buy drinks on you own she commanded me And she kept on and on like she was the general of an army I kept my cool and told her that she was very rude and should behave  My friends soon arrived and she kept her mouth shut I find the staff very power hungry and very immature I feel sorry for the bartender that she feels so bad about herself that she tried to ruin other peoples fun night People that dont had to work in The weekends  The funny thing is that if the staff hadnt been so rude we would have bought much more beverages  Like others recommand Join Sherlock Holmes bar instead And stay away from The Golden Lion
250 kr for 10 shots enough said
Possibly unfair but the place was next to empty dark and the tables sticky Staff were friendly enough but the drunk at the bar detracted from the already lacking atmosphere
British beers in a Sherlock Holmes themed British pub Everything served at the correct temperature with courteous and knowledgeable staff A must try for this in Aarhus looking for something a little different but also a bit familiar
Nice place to hang out and watch the games The staff are friendly and the bar has very neat decor Worth a visit
Good English Pub with a decent selection of beers and craft beers Cool environment and often live music In one part of the bar you can smoke
A cozy pub that has a rough edge in a good kind of way Heavily Holmes themed its definitely a UKstyled pub It has a good beer selection and smoking  and nonsmoking areas
Its pretty good Fairly cheap spacious and the games always on Theres the snorkel kork korl stork and the problems with my liege and his splerk gorbcore goblin lord but theres nothing you can do to change that You have to accept the things you cannot change Five stars
Good prices but closed ewrlt at 2
Must be one of the cheesiest places to buy beer as you can buy a whole mug for 110
Love That place 
Cozy lovely place with locals You can have unexpectedly great evenings in what seems to be only a neighborhood bar I love going there once a week at least with my buddies
Fantastic little Bodega in Aarhus actually bigger than Id thought theyve got dart and pool and cheap prices for the beer what more could you wish for I had hoped that the music was a little louder but it was alright
Its disgusting that they allow smoking in pubs and not just this one The rest of the EU follow rules and the danish do not What makes them so special
A really relaxed and traditional place Grab a cold cheap beer and hear some stories from locals  Tip Its a smoker friendly place
Great atmosphere  friendly staff Cool decor
If you have tattoos dont go there we were been told that because we have neck and face tattoos we werent allowed to enter  You have plenty of better places in rhus than this one
Cheers to the amazing staff this place has  They make this place truly special 
Nice place to grab a beer
Small cozy bar with friendly staff and fair prices You are allowed to smoke here
Cozy pub great beer just a pity that smoking is allowed
Great people and great whiskyrum selection
Smoking allowed Classic and cozy
The band playing drew me in the IPA and the friendly staff kept me there as they played through some great tunesand all on a school night
Very nice place Good music nice atmosphere and friendly staff
Great place great bartenders excellent service 
As a foreigner drinks are a bit underwhelming
Its one of the best stocked bars in town with a huge selection of beers whiskys and other alcohol The prices are also very reasonable You wont find too much to snack on though Most importantly the atmosphere and clientele is heavily university student If that is what youre looking youll find nowhere better in Aarhus  if not consider somewhere else
A 30 page long beer menu  whats not to like
They have a wonderful beer collection  Impressive Good prices and friendly staff too
A nice place with dimm lighting and a wide selection of beverages especially beer Board games and the likes are also available Enjoy student friendly prices andor membership discounts annual membership
I have been here only for standup comedies every Sunday at 2000 The place is nice but its underground
Went on a standup english comedy noght Nice place as it was free I did expect the drink prices to be higher and they are definitely quite high But it is a cozy place that feels rustic and homey
An amazing bar with oldschool vibes and decoration providing big variety of tapas and very good drinks at reasonable prices I was there last friday and the bartender who was currently working was the kindest person ever giving us an amazing customer service and making really good drinks Keep the good work 
We went there for the stand up comedy evening but we couldnt find the entrance to the place Theres no instructions how to get there at all We arrived at the address and searched for the entrance for 15 minutes with no effect Considering its in the cellar there should be a sign or some other guidance we also tried calling the place but got no response
Took 15h to get food Place filled to max but it tasted good Nice place to drink beers outside if the Weather allows
Lovely place for lunch Fish and chips were very well presented and battered fish is excellent Great value
A pub like in Britain or Ireland and open late which seems rare in this beautiful  Danish town The selection of beer is great comprising Irish classics like Guinness and Murphys as well as Belgian like the wonderful Grimbergen ale Recommendation
Lots of options for beer and whiskey they have the best burger Ive had in Denmark but the hallway always smells like pee
Super
A wonderful local pub with many different good events Price moderate
Cozy clean place Would love to come again
Really cozy pub good service and atmosphere Funny humor among customers and staff you feel welcome 
Hidden in a small alleyway you can find this amazing classic British Pub If u like pop culture draft beer and authenticity this is the place to be
Great english pub in Odense Great beers and great atmosphere Friendly owner
Great English pub  with a wide selection of British beers on tap  Plenty of seating as well as a few card games to keep you entertained  Worth a visit
Atmosphere was cozy and intimate drinks were great staff was super friendly and they plan out regular events such as karaoke and quizzes Nothing like a bit of friendly competition to get the beer flowing Im DEFINITELY coming back
Perfect place to watch sports Lots of screens and great beer
Nice screens many games starred very cheap beer with a student discount
Great selection of beer good company and high quality screens to watch all kinds of sport Mostly football though and Premier League in particular
One of the best places to watch football games in Odense
Excellent beer barpub great friendly atmosphere and a must visit for beerol enthusiasts great choice of beers 
Love this place A no nonsens bar with good music a large range of beers and nice staff Our favorite bar  if we are in Odense
This is one of my absolute favorite bars in Odense The atmosphere is good and the personnel are really friendly  They got a pretty good variety of cocktails whisky and also a couple of beers that youre not likely to find in many other places in Odense  The prices are pretty fairaverage and theyre open much of the day which means you can also stop by there by noon and get a cup of coffee
Probably my favorite wateringhole in Odense Has an impressive selection of beers from around the world with a focus on Danish breweries of all shapes and sizes Wonderful chill place on weekdays and more crowdedloud on the weekends
It was very nice  Will come again another time 
Absolutely fantastic service that makes you feel incredibly welcome big smiles and good tips on where to go next Reasonable beer in a classic Danish pub No one must go to Odense without stopping by we would love to come again
It was so nice for me to go there again Will definitely be a place I want to come to for posterity 
A fun inn in Odense There is a corona closure but it will be good to come again when corona opens up society again There are many regular customers you can have a chat with So look forward to the opening again and visit the old tavern It is close to Ftex inner city
I visited Amys at the end of a twoday training course with some of th trainers and the participants Amys is a very pleasant place and when we arrived quite quiet Wedidnt have any food but the selection of drinks and the service was admiarble and quick
Very nice bar  Also has outdoor covered patio in the event some rain falls  Irish coffee tray is postcard worthy  Wish I lived closer as I would make this my regular spot
This feels like a genuine olace with the right ideas but in the wrong location It draws a lot of people and feels a little touristy  We came rather late in the eve ing when the place was close to full and had beer and a cheese platter both very good  Not a bad place at all just not my preference for a wine bar
Beautiful pub restaurants very friendly staff in middle of the town can sit an watch the world go by well worth a visit
Fun place with fair prices All staff in the German Dirndl and Lederhosen  thats a nice Flair Good music I recommend to do the spinning wheel It has some great prizes For example a vodka bottle with mixers for 45 DKK  it does not get any cheaper than that 
I was not allowed to keep my jacket with me so I had to spend 35 DKK to store it and when I got it back and had my seat again the security staff came to me saying that jackets were not allowed well Ill not be there again but you should leave your jacket at home if you decide to spend your precious time and money there
Really Rude Staff Had area closed with available seats and the bar wouldnt  open it before more people arrived even though we had to stand So no available seat And everyone in the bar wasForced to take of your jackets and pay for the service  NOT worth a visit
Afterskiparty Drunk but quite fun Classic party music
Good cheap and lively music Local with good atmosphere Maybe the music is too loud
Relaxed and inexpensive serving some of the most traditional Danish dishes
Great Danish food very tasty very cultural very good
Very stylish and they serve a great lunch Bit expensive though
Good place with a nice crowd Tend to let a bit to many people in for comfort Have a weekly table soccer tournament on Thursdays
Warm too light and the music was not loud enough but great party 
We were denied the entry because WE DIDNT HAVE THE EUROPEAN MEDICAL CARD What a bullshit We had our European id cardswe are over 30 and we WERENT DRUNK What a shame
Very nice place Good music and a lot of happy people
A small pub where you can play dices smoke inside and get a cold beer at a reasonable price 
Come meet the friendly locals at a place where the staff are as drunk as you and where the drinks are simple cheap and plentiful
To smokey for my liking
I really liked the hat
Probably the best playlist in Odense Cocktails are really good but music is better Came for the cocktails stayed for the music So far from the other places around which play the same trash beats
Excellent bar excellent booze abd excellent service Adk the bartender about the booze and get a sample Whats not to like
Best drinks in Odense Prices are not sky high and the small place is cosy They do allow smoking every Friday which makes it a horrible place to be if you want to enjoy your drink Live music can be experienced here from time to time too
Perfect drinks cocktails will bring you to your knees the music is one of a kind  The best pub in Odense
Low to the roof but an awsome vibe and nice drinks pricing
Great danish ambient
Ok
Really a bad place I dont think the staff working behind the wardrobe should have their jobs They are rude and it seems like 1 thing that they have to make sure you have the worst night in the world as soon as you walk in the door EW Last time I come here Really hope that one day Bargroup wakes up and closes this place Or that things go so badly for the whole Bargroup that they are silently and painfully eaten up by Rekum
C4 conduct really good beer testing festival They have around 100 different beer to try out Cheers 
Good selection of beers Great pub setting Old school boozer
Best place to have exactly the beer that suits you Dark fruity sour bright From many different countries Good prices and cozy atmosphere indoor though not many places so be i  good time as it is well visited
When I am very thirsty lets stop for for a drink  Small place but wonderful environment  cozy and enjoy a bit of the sun Not much choice on wine  but good mood cover all 
You havent been on a real bender if you dont end up here Watch out for pickpockets and other hustlers This is were everybody ends up when everything else closes
Best morning bar Get there around 57 am to catch the true atmosphere
This is the place to go when every other bar is closed but youre not ready to end your night or public transport isnt available yet
Very local dive bar
Atmospheric place even though visited around daytime Beer selection is great and inside area feels very authentic There is vide selection of beers like there should be in a nice pub Great outside area and positioning Burgers were ok but that kind of can be explained by this place being a pub and that it has rather cheap burgers
Amazing traditional pub with loads of homecooked meal options and a brilliant selection of beers Best pub Ive been to outside of Ireland and Germany

John Bull Pub is a nice pub in the center of Aalborg The interior is old angel style Only the interior is worth a trip The large selection of different beers The staff is nice and helpful It is definitely a pub that should be visited if you are in Aalborg
Really nice pub with great outdoor tables You can buy peanuts and potato chips to accompany your drinks here but no food is available
Great place to chill have great drinks  great whiskeys at very reasonable prices Best prices in town for a pub   The reason for the 3 star is that I believe they could do with a renovation The booth couches are very outdated  coming apart where you can see the sponge filling of the inside of the seating booth  Also their glasses are very dirty and I would like to enjoy my 60kr whiskey from a polished glass not like the glass below which is very old  stained
Standard pub youll find any in place There was a good verity in beer and we enjoyed ourselves
Cozy spot Nice selection of both beer and whisky One of the few places you can smoke inside Do recommend

Larger combined pub pool table and dart venue situated right in the main party street Nice atmosphere and serviceminded staff Drinks not of the best quality unfortunately
Horrible customer service The barman asked us in not at all nice way  to leave table as it was reserved I was just moving our staff when he took my beer away full beer I just bought at the bar When I came to talk about it he did not even let me speak He was very rude to me No apology He instead insulted me After I asked him for the name he said he is the owner so it seems like he doesnt care Well we customers do care If this is the way he treats his customers I dont wanna know what he does to his employees DONT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS There are better pool places in the town anyways The service was very slow and the place dirty
We always like to go back there
Nice place with good tables great atmosphere and friendly staff

Never have I experienced such an unpleasant encounter with a bartender as here She interfered in whether the unvaccinated are a burden on society simply because I am not vaccinated  never set foot there again
Is such a cozy place Lovely Kromutter and equally lovely Krofatter Here we have what everyone should have
The Riverside Pub is always a nice place to come Friendly staff and good tone in the pub
A nice place to be and cozy 
Sucks
In Esbjerg we are an old fishing town and otters are still distributed here Its 1000 in the morning and someone has already tried to start an odd fight  told me to shut up because he got caught in one of his lies and got embarrassed He then found out himself 
Really bad experience apparently you cant buy a beer even if you have a photo ID
Really good experience Mona was pleasant at work but we missed Trine Really good cocktails
Such a nice place Very cozy and chill sportsbar and then I think its nice that you get 20 discount as a student
Nice and frendly
Good place
Nice place with cozy atmosphere but underprioritization of staff in the cloakroom created conflict for them seeing having to drop off and pick up jackets
Nice atmosphere waiter and bartender paying attention Was willing to eat some traditional Danish dishes unfortunately they dont make But the Mex Burger I ordered was fabulous Beer good as well 
Poor girl on her own serving a packed bar Good on her top marks for being efficient and friendly Would recommend
Great atmosphere and lovely staff highly recommended 
Great bar with loads of activities Perfect for drinking a beer with your buddies while watching a game of football
The tables were really sticky
Nice cost place and friendly bar staff Tuborg was just over 2 a bottle A lot cheaper than what I was expecting
Good friendly staff and happy hours too Ill be backbwhen next in Esbjerg
35 years of memories If the walls could talk
Great service good music A good place to have fun and to enjoy evening 
I was kicked out in the toilet after I asked if it was cool to skip the queue after which the guard comes and throws me out Fair he doesnt know there is evidence but when are you guilty of the opposite is proven in dk  Cool legal society
Cool atmosphere nice staff definitely my go to place
Complete power hungry bald guard who lets 15 year old girls in without ID but turns adults away He must be fired immediately  no one likes him




One word that I can use to describe this pub is  humour Barry is some character I might say  He just never stops joking I remember ordering a black beer and he asked me if I wanted some milk with it    Apart from the laughter the pub is well equipped to suit a wide range of alcohool consumers
The place has a nice atmosphere but the outside chairs are not the most comfortable chairs The beer and other drinks alongside with the snacks are good and the staff is friendly
oh yes the best
Fantastic place for a night out with friends Theres plenty of good beer dart and dice to keep one going
very good service
Good place to play pool
They are just good

Great drinks good music
Nice place nice staff great beer Thanks from lcfc fans
Just rather not go back there Rude guard and completely horrible experience
Comfortable place smoking allowed upstairs
Great selection of draft beer  the biggest in Kolding If you are not sure what to order you can get a free sip  always good atmosphere big screen to watch sport and live music all year around
Nice English pub I felt comfortable here and they also had good tea 
Just love pubs this Great selection of beer on taponly fine for a lager today though
Nice pub friendly staff But the food was cold it tasted like the fish was fried in old oil I didnt really like the food
Great bar with very wide selection of drinks from many beers to various cocktails and even sangria Interior can get a little tight but the atmosphere is great and very enjoyable Outside area is sizeable and also includes sheltered area Highly recommend
Small place but nice  atmosphere Little Funking place Very popular  with young people Excellent Bar
This place is one of the best beer gardens in Kolding Chill and good prices Q I Soda water is more expensive than juice
Cosy and good atmosphere A lot of options for beers and cocktails Price ranging from cheap to high depending what you want Option to play some cards and whatnot Nice staff Quizzes on Monday and Wednesday depending on the time of year  No smoking inside but outside theres a sizeable area with a bunch of bench spaces heater elements and a terrace  Cool place

Cool bar to get on
Fantastic little pub with the best atmosphere and sweet bartender
Nice and cozy place with good music
Nice neighborhood pub
Such a nice place tin Town  
Socially amazing 
Love it
Was going to play shuffleboard but no no because we dont live in ancient times and didnt have a physical ID as a deposit Then they could get a photo of the drivers license and keep my phone no not good enough
Good place for joint activities pool darts etc However there is a lack of focus on the fact that the selection in the bar can be served as well as the possibility to use the various activities
Good hamburgers and nice staff who made a good chicken salad even though it wasnt on the menu 
Cozy place with food and drinks 
We simply get a nice 4 stars because of the nice toilet and super waitress probably named Jeanettenice place



We spun the wheel we won a tank of beer and out the blue the bartenders decided to spin it again claiming it was not valid I could only recommend it if you want to be scammed
The staff and the door Stewart were completely unprofessional I frequent a rekom establishment every day and I have NEVER been treated like this  I am so disappointed with the service I came  away for a little break from my usual city I will never come here again
We spun the wheel we won a tank of beer and out the blue the bartenders decided to spin it again claiming it was not valid I could only recommend it if you want to be scammed
Super cozy and nice place nice price for drinks nice staff All in all a very nice place However a bit difficult to find if you are not locally known as Google Maps takes you a strange way Consider possibly to get some pictures of your facade posted on Google Maps 
Dough same day fine good angansiment 12 with arrow up
They were there for a short day I liked the atmosphere the beer was cold and cheap the music was great
Klods hans has been many things to me  in the old days it was a place where I spent a lot of time today I come occasionally  old days were better  When you are used to drinking something that is not in stock you also look for it  super customer service 
Klods Hans is a super cozy place you cant go wrong in the city if youre looking for high spirits
Lovely pub good selection of beer and snacks spot on atmosphere
Good beer good staf
Nice smorgasbord
Small cozy pub Good selection of foreign beers Definitely worth a visit  On warm days places outside in the pedestrian street where you can enjoy your drink or similar and look at life in the street
Hello one question will you be able to see the game this Sunday between Real Madrid and Atltico de Madrid
Great place however not a place I would go if a actually wanted a place to watch sports as music drowns out any sound coming from all of the different TVs however its a great place to get a couple of beers with friends
Been going there for years now the service is great and so is the music Its a cozy place to hang
Great place  friendly staffsells Guinness
Cozy place perfect to grab a drink or beer and talk or pregame a night out The bartenders are down to earth and easy to talk to
After a rough saturday night I needed a stiff drink so I ventured to the place included in so many of my friends stories Marys Pub The scotch was fine though the bartenders look was a bit off when I politely refused any ice and instead just a few drops of water and the beer was cheap and chilled Not the last time Ill make an appearance at Marys
A hipster bar in Vejle cheap beer attracts some weird company But its cheap beer so 45 generally a great bar for predrinking
Its not a place where u should go to when u are in Vejlethey dont even accept a fully corona vaccinationthey are unfriendly and they only answer in word Shame on u
Super 
Super
Great authentic pub Yesterday was live music with a Bruce Springsteen cover band The band was first class and entertained the guests very well All hell broke loose in the alley great atmosphere and delicious fresh Carlsberg
Really nice place to visit very service minded waiters
Friendly staff Not to badly priced Great selection of beverages
Perfect place to grab a beer with friends  The waiter Yannick if I remember right was marvelous helping us as tourists
Had a great night out with boys Great atmosphere and lovely staff
Loved it The best and friendliest pub in town Very cosy Id highly recommend it Theres always a warm welcome from the owners and experienced bar staff Service with a smile  
Very enjoyable place people are kind cocktails are good age average is about 30 prices are good
Regular dance pub club
Cool place
Ok
terrible and disgusting place
Can be better
Ok drinks staff always vary a lot some are great and others a bit down  You must not wear cargo pants ie such fashionable ones that are anything but work pants  The prices are nothing to write home about but its not a robbery
Cozy place with lots of atmosphere but far too tightly packed and a halfbaked playlist So huge minus that exposed tables are not fixed so the amount of times the table was knocked over with drinks on it was enormous Of beautiful dancing mice not the best impression
A London style pub with great beer selection both local and international Good vibe and great music too
The best place in Vejle especially if youve moved here and youre trying to make friends in the same situation Great staff with great knowledge of all things beverage They dont do food but I have given them 5 stars because they let you bring your own and will pair your wok this way perfectly with an IPA x
An excellent pub with great beer and great staff couldnt have felt more at home
Amazing please for genders Personal has experience when it come to service but also have a pathetic humor as myself 
what has to happen for you to see that nobody is dancing with you  Ill give 5 as an incentive
Very good place
Ok high prices but nice place
Nice interior Less great management
Ok
Very crowded
Tried their Wheel of Fortune it landed on the most expensive prize but they wont give it out Really bad experience
A great place with nice prices and good music 
Absolutely fantastic food My first night in town I was out to grab something to eat and walked by this place and thought lets have a pita It was so incredibly good tasting and full that I ended up having to go back couple nights later to enjoy another one before starting my journey back home to Canada
The food is amazing and the owner and his wife are such great hosts If you want a real tasty food definitely check this restaurant out
Meat is very good but its mixed with cheapest soggy and cold out of fridge canned corn and peas Disgusting choice of veggies
Amazing food this couple make delicious sandwiches and are very hospitable loved eating in this restaurant and my kids loved their burgers thank you
Cozy place good drinks and skilled staffthe music got a little too loud at the end but other than that a good visit
We had a really good waiter named Oscar he was very polite and articulate
Total chaos to order drinks and the music was turned up so loud that the sound was just bad and people sat and held their ears
Excellent drinks and service I recommend
I was refused entry tonight Even though Im in my thirties and havent been asked for ID since I was fourteen tonight was different My EU drivers license was considered inadequate and it was demanded I present my Danish ID card which I had luckily left at  home  The doorman obviously had problems with foreigners and thought he could upset us or start trouble by not allowing us entry He seemed shocked when it has the opposite effect  Barmix is one of the top nightclubs in Vejle which does not mean much considering there are only three of them Compared to other nightclubs in Denmark and the rest of the world its pretty rubbish We were already reluctant to enter knowing what the place was like from a previous visit but none of us wanted to be the first to go home Being refused entry was the best news I had heard all day It saved me several hundred Kroner a hangover and I was able to have a reasonably early night  Thank you idiot doorman You have made my day 
Dont go there when you are visiting Denmark We couldnt enter to the club because we didnt speak Danish  I wish owners the same experience when they will travel to other countries No party for the people outside Denmark PURE RACISM
The doorman has some issues and the staff is rude No wonder why it was empty on a Friday night
Told me I coulden enter with my sweat pants after having bought table i got in
It cant be right that the service in the bar is so slow When to sober up before I get served 45 min Is too long to wait and it wasnt just one time
Super cool place Just Namedrop Jacob H at the door or at the bar So you get 100 inside and get a discount
Second time at Tema Bar Good service from wardrobe to bartender especially from the new bartender Joakim Good concept and does its best to get as close to their theme as possible
Nice place good parties and good mood Only complaint is that I wish there were some guards inside to keep an eye on how the men behave towards the women so it will be a safer night life Besides its not particularly smart to learn that there is surveillance in the girls toilet that can be seen in the mens toilet seems strange
Chill bar and poolhouse
God service
Anders the man
Such a real pub with a billiards table of course in a smokefilled room even though the premises are smokefree with live matches on TV and lots of fans who support them very emotionally The decor gives a lot to think about but its nice and safe
A great pubtype place perfect for a pint with your buddies The staff really know beer and the selection is tops I just let them choose for me and they totally nailed it
One of the best bars in Roskilde Has good selection on tap sometimes small batches I was fortunate to try some Overall nice and cozy place with barman easy to talk to and always has a story to tell
Nice and cozy bar with loads of different draft beers  We were met by a very jolly bartender who let us taste some samples in the category we were searching for so youre sure to get a beer you like Definitely a recommendation
Fun place to hangout and drink beers They have a variety of international beers on TAP which is such a big pro Nice service They fill your beer to the brim and with a smile
Great little bar in Roskilde and its a very fair price for beers
I was her 2 years ago and the bartender was a bit special and changed the keg to something completely different but didnt tell me Tonight the bartender ended up being one I knew and loved from another bar so a definite improvement
Nice selection of interesting draft beer Very laid back and easygoing place at least on a Tuesday afternoon
Cozy and small local bar with a good selection of both modern and traditional breweries
Great place to listen to live musicwatch sports or just drink and hang out Several rooms to find your groove  Well run and Guiness was cold and staff is courteous and works hard   Location is unbelievable you walk outside and see a 700 year old church lit up in the night sky
Really enjoyed my time here The food was delicious and the drink was also good Great atmosphere and friendly staff
Ok pun Atmosphere was good but it gets busy very quickly Good pun if you want a drink and watch football I found the waitresses a bit irritating they provide a good service and then ask you when you pay to give them a tip if they think they received good service It doesnt look genuine I prefer if you give a good service and WE decide if you deserve a tip or not Anyway it was an OK experience
Typical outside Irleand irish pub but with really good selection of irish beers on tap Guinness Kilkenny OHaras etc  way more in bottles Decent 3550 pub food Nice service and hospitality despite full house
Best Adress for Food and Drinks in Prag after 2 days and 5 Restaurants we were a group of 9 and they opened the lower floor for us early bartender was super nice and even remembered names Drinks we drank different kind of beers which are at a good price 95135 Czech crowns which is okay in my eyes  Food I took the black Angus steak Im a steak lover and this steak blew me off havent had a steak like that in long time on point medium perfect seasoning rounded up with garlicbutter 12 of 10 points in my eyes my fellowship had different burgers which all come with fries prices also reasonable and good here  CrowdPlace lot of cool folks around all having a good time we liked the vibe stayed from 810pm there are a lot of TVS for sport and also dart and pool area Karaoke Fridays and Saturdays and Live Music almost every day
Highly recommend this Irish pub They host karaoke on Fridays and Saturdays creating a lively and noisy atmosphere with great vibes They serve excellent Guinness While I didnt try the food they do seem to offer traditional Irish dishes just be aware that the kitchen closes around 10pm or so They always have sports on TV and the staff is exceptionally friendly and accommodating Prices are reasonable for the area They do accept card payments
Classic irish pub serving guiness and aweosme food like burger hot dogs onion rings The burger was really good We went to watch F1 race and had big screen with sound The place is big and could get noisy ad it is a sports bar people are often loud If you are looking for sport bar with good food make sure to check it out
Its a Pub If thats what youre looking for this is a great place The staff was incredible and extremely friendly and welcoming Some of the best people I met on my trip to Prague The drinks are cheap and compared to most similar other places in the area doesnt get as crowded with people Come here have a drink talk with bartenders and have a good time
We were in Prague for 5 days this September We ate and drank here every day Loved this place Staff is great Food is great especially Marys Fries
The atmosphere was awful The only good thing was Maria that was really helpful but after she left the service was REALLY bad  If you want to have warm Latino service look for Maria and youll have a great time otherwise the place is gray and boring
Real irishness both in the atmosphere and the waiters very funny and authentic experience You can watch sport on the TVs or just enjoy the different theme nights that this pub offers Highly recommended
Wonderful Irish pub near the center and the river Czech or Irish beer and lots of whiskeys Great food the fish and chips is an authentic piece of England and the spicy chicken wings are among the best I have ever got Extremely recommended
A fabulous pub  restaurant  Great atmosphere and excellent prices The staff are friendly and helpful  Definitely give it a try  After 3 really good visit  Went last night  Some Scottish lads came in and ever word was F this F that  Plus he gave us all a detailed description of his thia massage  Not what you want to hear when out with the wife Im not a prud in anyway  We drank up and left  We wont be going back  Sorry Rocky
Biggest Irish Pub in Prague thats the claim its got two sides that are not really connected which is a bit odd Plenty of nooks and crannies for seating Good place for big groups or just one Food was ok really enjoyed the soup and chili con carne The shepherd pie needed alot more seasoning We went for Trivia night and greatly enjoyed it Trivia is in English and hosted by a fun gentleman that makes up the quiz every week on his own This produces a really unique experience very different from the bar trivia games Im used to back in the states We did spend almost three hours for the game but as long as that fits in your schedule definitely worth it Bartenders and servers pretty friendly for Prauge and several Irish beers on tab along with some locals as well
This place is fantastic Great service by Cristina Excellent and tasty chicken club Huge big screen for the football match Im already back for day 2 Highly recommend
A cozy pub next to the main square They have a big screen for watching the sports nice drinks and friendly stuff and the karaoke with people from the whole Europe was fun
Great atmosphere fabulous staff all so helpful and friendly and the manager Craig is the best We were in Prague for 5 days and our best nights were in Caffreys
Amazing Irish bar Impressive selection of beers and cocktails topnotch burger and friendly staff The Karaoke and screens created a lively vibe Perfect spot for a great evening
Ive visited here a few times but usually for drinks and the staff have always been as expected friendly helpful and attentive  Service is 5 stars   Unfortunately came for the full Irish Breakfast and it was not great  It looks great and you will get an actual fry up everything deep fat fried including toast and very salty  Eggs were overcooked chewy and salty  Bacon and sausages were great and beans and tomato were nice but sadly overpowered by the salty eggs and mushrooms  Plus side nice to get a proper pot of tea brew with milk
I recently had the absolute pleasure of visiting Caffreys Irish Bar and I must say it was an incredible experience that transported me straight to the heart of Ireland From the moment I walked in I was greeted with warm hospitality and an authentic atmosphere that truly captures the essence of Irish culture  The ambiance of the pub is something to behold With traditional Irish dcor cozy wooden furniture and an inviting fireplace I felt like I was stepping into a charming pub right off the streets of Dublin The attention to detail in recreating the Irish pub experience was remarkable and its clear that the owners have a deep appreciation for Irish heritage  Now lets talk about the food and drinks The menu boasts an impressive selection of classic Irish dishes that are prepared to perfection I couldnt resist trying the fish and chips and I was blown away by the crispy batter and tender fish inside The Irish stew was another highlight brimming with hearty flavors that warmed both my stomach and my heart And of course no visit to an Irish pub would be complete without a pint of Guinness poured to absolute perfection The drink menu also offered a wide range of other Irish and international beverages to suit every taste
Popped in yesterday on the off chance as we were visiting the castle So glad we did had some lunch and the food was excellent Good size portions reasonably priced And friendly staff Would happily return
Cool pub with a wide variety of drinks nice and friendly staff and an absolutely nice bar to sit at The menu is stuffed with pleasure foods and everything that we had tasted very very good There are also some locals  which is always a good sign  Full recommendation
The service was very bad We ordered for irish fries They served the fries with bacon on it As i do not eat meat i asked her if she can get it without bacon on it She argued a lot and then finally changed it  But then when we got our bill i was charged for both and the same was not told to me while i was served with the other fries
Perfect bar experience with good beers and great bar snacks I can definitely recommend the Guinness barbecue chicken wings and beers They have various draught Czech beer options and Irish whiskeys The staff are very welcoming and hospitable also theyre really quick in their job Total service and bar experience is better than most of the bars in old town The place is also cozy and spacious If you are close by just come and drink a couple of beers You wont regret Na zdrav 
Incredibly friendly spot We stopped in a few times for a pint and chips They have TVs with UK sports playing and fun Irish music Highly recommended
Highly recommend a visit here if youre in the area Truly a great pub  We stopped in for lunch and a few drinks The service and food was top notch as were the drinks Price is very reasonable Overall a great place to stop The best pub we visited in Prague
Excellent garden patio and welcoming vibes So glad we popped in here and then againand again The owner clearly loves being here and running this spot and has a contagious upbeat energy Immediately felt like the right kind of local pub dont skip out on this spot 
Can recommend A very friendly pub with good food near many tourist activities Wonderful Irish music which is a welcome change from listening to 70s American hits in every other establishment Great terrace for warmer days Super Irish coffee
Very nice staff but the food is falsely advertised as being Cuban when all I got was a standard burger and fries Very underwhelmed dont believe the fusion label on the menu This is just standard pub food
Absolutely enjoyed every minute with Phil and the staff Best karaoke bar in Prague The atmosphere was amazing Kept coming back every night Definitely recommend to visit for a great time 
OChes Cuban Irish Bar in Prague has reopened under new Management Fresh New Look to the Bar and New Kitchen The New Management is dedicated to returning OChes to its place as one of Pragues best venues Make OChes Great Again
I think I could cook a better meal in 10 minutes with a camping stove and a spoon than the absolute atrocity we received here I got the saucage and mash and everything tasted like you could buy it prepackaged in a grocery store or even worse Only reason I ate most of it was because it was a source of carbs  protein and I was hungry  The sauce with the spicy burger not spicy btw tasted like straight vinegar or a biproduct from the petrochemic industry  Cocktails barely had any alcohol in them Long island iceteas are just cokes with a lot of ice  If you find yourself here go for the pollo burger it was the only OK dish our group got  EDIT My friend who ordered this meal had to go to the toilet about 30 minutes after eating his burger to vomit so it might also not be that good of an option  Its an Irish pub named to Ch Guevara with Belgian beer serving bad food and bad cocktails This should have been our first big red flag I guess  If the cook reads this if there even is a cook in this place please quit or start caring about the food you serve  Staff was friendly though so if thats all you care about its kinda nice
Nice Place
Best of irish pub in prague


Cozy pub serving Czech food and drinks We stopped for a quick beer and had a warm welcome The walls are coveted with masonic symbols and there are some pictures and swords on display
This was without a doubt the best meal that my wife  I had in Prague while on our honeymoon several years ago  Incredible architecture and design  We came early and had an entire room to ourselves until the later dining crowd started coming in as they do in many major European cities  Service was great  Food was simple and very flavorful  Would return for lunch or dinner in a second
We were welcomed even at bad hours Food was very good but some dishes they recommend for sharing are not enough for people who likes eating The atmosphere is calm but maybe a little cold
Nice cozy pub with tasty food and a great theme Try the Baked Pan Chicken Beef or Pork
Really excellent bar thats away from the more touristy spots Locals were friendly and welcoming we had a great night
One of few real Prague bars at Lesser Town Really not tourist trap Prices can be a very positive suprise for tourists If somebody is asking for more kinds of beer it is necessary to add that beer compering to wine has not been and is not the most popular drink in these tradition bars
Friendy atmosphere Small terrace with just 3 tables A nice woman served me Loved this place Doesnt look like a trap for tourist I was the only one not Czech
Tiny little place you could easily miss  Do check it out not a tourist trap but a traditional Czech watering hole Serves Budweiser and Radegast pivo and a great selection of local spirits as well as caf tea  hot chocolate
A hidden gem of a wine bar On a lovely quiet street and a sun trap in the early evening The perfectly acceptable local wines are very reasonably priced We keep coming back
Youre looking for the real Olomouc  youll find it there Unbelievable good wines for unbelievable fair prices come with a hearty atmosphere 
Very nice and quiet place Landscape paintings by Josef Ohka are on display here until October 30 2022
Very nice owner Although he was full he still apologized for not being able to offer us a table and willingly poured wine for us on our way Cozy environment
A pleasant establishment in the passage Masn Krmy Great design pleasant service
Excellent brew pleasant climate

A very nice place but sometimes very crowded
Nice pub
Super
Excellent beer I dont know the food firstclass service
Classic pub Unfortunately when you get a craving for beer you only have to make do with nuts chips or just such a classic Thumbs up for me
A bar with an excellent atmosphere right in the center of Olomouc acts as an oasis where you can relax at any time Sometimes however he runs up to cover anything he can And write that they are taking your chicken
Nicely renovated place great bartender pleasant and smiling Reasonable prices good selection I would only point out that there are no small fish in the aquarium But I will definitely not deduct a star for it He sings there dances on the bar Football luxury It used to be free so now you have to pay but Im not removing the star again There was never bread for a drowning man but it will happen Another minus star Im happy I will definitely visit this bar again
The environment was nice but the music and by that I dont mean the music was even outside on the street Cloudy even foggy This just wasnt for us We didnt even last until the order
For the first time and certainly not for the last time the perfect Bar for late nights until the morning in Olomouc where else can you have a beer a drink and karaoke until 5 am on Wednesday
Really nice atmosphere music and mood The barmen are really nice and accommodating I recommend 
Fresh orange cocktail was super good

Great drinks and perfect atmosphere

A classic pub nothing particularly interesting Quite clean the service does not inspire The opening hours do not correspond to what is on the website Beer good
Menicko excellent and even better white grapes on tap

An unpleasant pub I bet on the way from the oneonone trip Waiter unpleasant The pub was almost empty and I still felt like a nuisance After one beer I preferred to continue elsewhere
They sell Bernard beer I dont know if the have anything else But beer was pretty good as expected Service was excellent location amazing
Great place but unfortunately around 12 pm we couldnt order anything although there was information that the place is open until 2 am
Great friendly bar great vibe and service and a good selection of drinks
Very nice Bar excellent beer with amazing views of old town square and trinity column Very friendly server and funky interior
Super
Very nice genuine pub excellent service and excellent Holba beer I can only recommend it to all indiscriminate beer drinkers
Hard to rate If youre not a local regular its pretty weird here and everyones looking at you like what the fck are you doing there It reminds me of the time when you smell like an ashtray after three beers But on the other hand a cool erk for a decent price Here you drink for volume not for taste 
A very sleazy business 
Supercool bar They have local micro brewery beers on draft Selection changes very regularly Nice selection of things to eat with your beer
This is true Czech style pub Here youll get not only great beer from local private breweries but also typical Czech atmosphere If you are lucky you will listen to live Czech music 
Great beer selection unfortunately very limited outdoor seating of just one table
Brilliant small bar on the edge of the city A must visit if you are Olomouc Wonderful staff
Cool place great staff amazing beer right at the main square 
Very nice place to drink and spend some time with your friends I had a great time there with my friends we went there for just one drink  and go but we end spending 1 hour and more there the weather was very nice
A little smelly place with average speed bartender but with good local beer Plus if you are a sportsfan there is a tv to watch some matches
Very nice place to have a couple really good specials Theres also an armwrestling table in this place 
Awesome service premium quality I love this place Trust me it is pretty good Try it
Is nice
exceptionally tasty cuba libre and spectacular hookah
LUXURY THE BEST DRINKS AND SISHA WITH TOP PERSONAL
Great place Really enjoyed
Great bar Ska punk rockabilly and other alternative music played from a jukebox great selection of rum very good wine and like everywhere great beer
Punk IPA is fake
Dobrej rumek pivko a super atmosfra
A very special bar I cant say exactly why but I have to recommend this bar Its unlike any bar Ive ever been to and definitely worth a visit
Genius loci Great atmosphere Fantasy vibes Nice talk with barman Definitely worth visiting when you are in Olomouc
subtle music muted lighting cozy interior great custom cocktails and the bartender is really nice to talk to found it by chance on a Tuesday night but would visit again given a chance cant recommend it enough
World class drinks in a very local atmosphere and medieval setting The owner is extremely knowledgeable and helpful The best gem in Olomouc bar none

I would like to share the unpleasant experience of a melted underbaked pizza and when we returned it we received the same but burnt one Ham junior as a disguise for prosccutto Since you will pay 230 for a pizza I would rather not even try it see photo
Probably the worst pizza ever We ordered for the first time and for import and never again They just threw mozzarella on the pizza the dough was as thick as a bun and we had to remove a ton of toppings from the pizza otherwise it wouldnt even be edible Unfortunately a huge disappointment
Nice place with pleasant staff I saw some musical instruments like guitar and piano and I guess you can play them as well
Nice and comfy place with good vibe Their beer is really good and they have very delicious toasts
Super chill vibes plenty of students in here usually defo check it out if youre Erasmus Cheap beer 36Kc or smth like that Friendly staff they do table service here and you pay at the bar when you leave
Lifemusic friendly place with young people all around with reasonable prices Even though the beer is not the best quality you will enjoy it there if you are not fan of classy spots
Super

Nice seating with a pleasant atmosphere and excellent delicacies on the grill I recommend the Czech classic grilled mackerel and ribs 
It is closed in winter but in summer there is a great grill and excellent beer A huge selection of perhaps 12 different beers plus excellent grilled meat I love coming back here and can highly recommend it I was always very satisfied
While the idea is to replicate American 60s or 70s it doesnt really feel that way Bloody Mary was balanced not a bit more alcohol in it would make it better
It would be better to see more cocktail  fun atmosphere here Unfortunately they have very limited number of shot cocktails and have no any idea about world famous cocktails like green mexican hiroshima and others Damn
No Czech beers available Only imported beers like Carlsberg or Stella a shame in CZ Great choice of cocktails though
Lovely pub with a large variety of cocktails
The food is delicious I really recommend the Rustic burger or the pork tenderloin The homemade lemonade is not really homemademy opinion  tasted like just a wattered sirop Also the stuff is not the friendliest but I recommend this place for a quick bite
The place is cozy and have nice atmosphere indeed Personal was kind and quick even though there were quite a lot Wolt orders We had Guinness beer which was very tasty For the meal you can see in the picture  King steak which was a huge portion both meat and fries Overall great experience would definitely recommend this place  Second picture from take away excellent 
Went there for 3 course dinner I loved tomato soup even more burger and sweet end in form of fluffy pancakes made it all perfect Recommend 
So far best steak in town  great good and prices and awsome service 
Nice place to party we have party cocktail for ten people It was fun
Yes they have lots of choice but 850cz for 2 drinks  Im not in London so dont expect to pay London prices  Jack Daniels Silver  15 year Havana club and coke are you kidding me 
Jin a Tonic the best taste 
Really good atmosphere nice staff and the cocktails Awesome Highly recommendable
Jut a nonstop Bar in the city center You can expect something special but sometimes the people around you will be special Enjoy a normal beer at 7am And dont expect nothing special
Terrible experience Girls unhappy seeing a customer
If you got nowhere to go Kahla 
Rude cleaning lady with awful beer my girlfriend has been harrased by the locals You should never go there
Very nice place Recommended for everyone

Worst pub in Brno
TopTop Barman
We had such a great time in this cozy watering hole in this lovely town We spend the evening there and we had blast from the moment we stepped in till the time we left The whole bar is a hidden gem and the guys behind the counter took great care of us The food was exquisite and the selection of fine high end whisky is amazing Will come here again Cheers
We did a whiskey tasting with a group of 1415 people  We had a great experience and our tasting guide was very informative  He walked us through the different whiskey we were tasting and provided great detail for every bottle Highly recommend this place if youre a whiskey connoisseur
absolutely stunning the service is more than perfect Weekdays are not crowded which is the best
As a whiskey lover youll find the variety quite delightful with service by polite and friendly hosts a cozy indoor setting and shaded outside seating areaand the RAMEN was divine The chefs are amazing Truly the breaded cauliflower was delicious so much so Id quite happily go vegetarian for themoverall one to check out I will be doing this againoften
Great little small bar with their speciality being in rum Lots of variety in rum aswell as many more cocktails Staff spoke English and was freidndly
Truly my favourite bar in Brno Friendly atmosphere and great service waiters are super friendly and nice as well Cocktails are delicious and choice of alcohol is fantastic Prices are nice too Even managed to become sort of friends with one waitress Very recommended Especially for those who like rum and rum based drinks
Great cocktails and friendly staff Really liked Dark and Stormy Will visit next time when in Brno 
The best place in Brno if you like RUM or cocktails based on it They have an amazing outsideinside area and you can have here a private party with catering and rum tasting Im going there time by time with friends and yesterday I had my bachelors party here and even friends who do not drink rum that much was supper happy with the tastes and selection prepared by the barmen  THANK YOU
I like this place because of the location mostly During springsummer season outside terrace offers a lovely view whether youre having food or just stop by for a drink Inside its a little bit small Beer selection is decent but sometimes I get the feeling that the staff is a bit overworked and not at their best
Draft carftbeers of local KOS brewery draft lemonadesoft drink cozy classic pub food including sausages with sauce from their black beer
Pretty nice variation of craft beers with nice beer garden and view
Bad service and overpriced Wont be coming back
Local brewery that offers its own beers and some meals The place is huge inside and it might become quite noisy due to a lot of people that fit there A classic pub The inner yard is a superb place for chilling specifically during summer evenings There are nice light chains hanging above the tables and creating cozy atmosphere Some beers from the offer were not available at the time when I visited the place As a result you might end up with a completely different style of the beer as you normally go for or as you intend at the moment
Pivovar Joke maybe dont know if the owner is a cool guy or if this is the best beer in Czech Republic I am sure is not after 10 years here but the guys behind the bar with that attitude break all the fun of going out with some friends and just have a beer and enjoy your time First of all no option for Non alcoholic beer dont know why it literally doesnt make sense Then the guy telling you that he doesnt have non alcoholic beer with an attitude that you should be ashamed of We were 5 people that we had to leave because it was not making sense for our only friend that drives and doesnt drink to stay in a place and not be able to get a non alcoholic beer  Also food is random some times there is sometimes is not unfortunate the guy with the moustache behind the bar is just a bartender he can use his attitude towards something else so better to give your money somewhere else very bad that people ruining a brand only because they are unable to have proper service
My first time here was super surprising as from the outside its very unassuming but when you go inside the place is absolutely huge  They are making their own beers and the ones we tried were all amazing Youll also find some great fast food to go with the beers Give the ginger beer a try its great a nice spice to it
Really cool place with great laidback vibe Good beer Really worth visiting  Big shout out to staff on Saturday evening Were smiling and helpful They surely made whole visit better
Great bar with a fantastic atmosphere and friendly staff It is a cozy place where you can enjoy your coffee during the daytime or hangout with friends in the evening when its turning into a bar with some party music I love their drinks from Tatra Tea and avocado sandwich Moreover you can play games on the Playstation at any time
Great bar very good service and atmosphere Wanna superb drink Take Irish Trash Can
Awesome especially without friends however if youre like me pros for having loads of empty spaces
Loved the place Great games to play great atmosphere great beer and I fully recommend the sandwiches Wellworth the visit 
The staff is amazing  They did their best while servicing us The food is also good Thanks 
Fair prices delicious burgers friendly and kind waiters Even when pub was full waiting time for burger was not long and it tastes delicious Lot of options for cocktails and shots but my favourite was cider with apple Jack Daniels Worth to visit and try
Really good burgers Meat is perfect bun and sauce too Just it would be nicer to have jalapenos instead of normal paprika in Mexican burger Good beer and perfect atmosphere There was live pianist when we were there Amazing
Good for grabbing a beer in groups having a food even late dinner in American style  burger onion rings and so on But i cant help myself but notice that sometimes the burger buns are not fresh but still I would recommend it as a place to have some food at night especially And I dont know whats the deal with the piano but they dont like people playing it  maybe write a sign on it ti Not touch it if you dont want people to touch it  Keep up good work and improve
Such a nice craft beer pub Staff helpful with their English clientele friendly good rock music in the background but not too loud and most of all great beer  Prices not unreasonable either Definitely worth a visit More seating downstairs table football for 10 czk  Whats not to love
Super nice Pub Good Beer small stage downstairs with occasional live acts Definitely a place to go for a relaxed evening Very stylish interior also
Good beer comfortable atmosphere very nice stuff Oh and hotdogs are more than worth 115 CZK DELICIOUS
Urban underground style burger and beer bar intense smell for those of you with sensitive noses Really nice selection of home brews and tasty burgers Burgers could be a little bigger or less expensive It has a nice underground floor with mini soccer
Nice food and interior how ever the beer was not great Service was really nice 45 stars
No parking space you have tu park your car on parking space five minutes from th hotel And pay fr it My sice cant wok and that was th trable
Beautiful interior very friendly staff really good food The only small sad thing was they ran out of soup already but its understandable 
Good food drinks  service as always Also like restaurants design  location
Stylish pub with the best Czech beer  Plze and also draft Guinness Good friendly vibe even during week day Wednesday people chatting rnb music in background  3 still smiling girls on bar Open till early morning Would recommend and go again  
Super
Guiness very expensive 55125CZK for a US pint 463ml vs 568ml standard IrishEU pint
Not real drinks and tried Mimoza Hugo and classic Aperol Spritz taste like water with some juice disappointed
Ok place and good food Some in our party had what they said was meat similar to kobe but from Australia and that seemed good I had the Black angus burger nothing special to little sause and to much bread  for my taste so it was to dry Huge selection of wines that can be bought per glas A bit higher prices than normal restaurants in the city  Waiter was not services minded and kind of ignored us I do recommend this resturant
Usually a great place for drink but today couldnt find a less interested couple of girls mobile phone is my friend who cares about costumers left really discasted had to ask for a bill terrible service If you like to be disrespectful it is a great place for you Enjoy
For plus Good typically czech or irisch beer  For minus Waiters were unpleasent They looked like nervous
Food did not try but Beer was good Wanted to try Irish Beer so cheers
Good beer nice atmosphere Still cant understand why people go to Irish pub and get Czech beer 
This was the place to be for Canadian hockey fans during the 2020 IIHF World Juniors hockey tournament Fun place to be good music selection Staff did a good job trying to keep the drinks flowing in an overcrowded bar
Good place to be on a friday evening good beer love the music
Ive visited the bar 3 days in a row on a first day it was quite enjoyable The other days not so much The staff was extremely rude and not English friendly which made me feel not welcome I wanted to order drinks and she looked at me very rude and i had two wait 30 minutes for a simple drink And then after all she charged me two times What kind of bad service is that Therefore I am leaving 1 star If i could give half a star i would do that But it depends on the staff worming the other day there waa a nic blond girl and she spoke English and she was very enjoyable So good luck in here  And learn from my experience
The club is quite nice almost like security When a mentally limited and probably anabolically stimulated person plays security while working without a contract its very pathetic Pavel tipka is a person whose reason remains that he can even have an ID card The person who is attacked is subsequently removed and has no possibility of further entry as this mentally disturbed person has been given a job Security has its own rules and regulations But this is not security
I came here from a group in which there were two Roma girls we didnt do anything we just came the Roma girls immediately took out my group then a policeman came he told me that the last time I brought gypsies here I didnt say half a word and the other policeman immediately arrested me he brought me out I was calm and behind the bars he tells me that Im not allowed to go there  that its the owners order  while after the mallow he told a friend who came there that the owner is sleeping  really good  if we at least did something But would I ban it for nothing Supposedly the owners order right When he sleeps  Hmm weird 
The club is located far from the center but there is a lot of life there You wont be bored there on Friday or Saturday The prices are normal the atmosphere is good but very little space which is probably the biggest disadvantage
The club has highly overpriced prices on the weekend compared to other clubs in Havov Very lowquality music not only that the sound was burnt and it hurt the ears but the dj couldnt keep the tempo and it died here and there to make matters worse it was completely white and you couldnt see even a step because everyone was smoking tubes or cigarettes and the club has no ventilation The club itself for nothing and I will punch the friend who recommended it to me Next time Id rather cut myself with a razor I regret this experience and you dont even have a place to put your things What the fuck is that Regardless of the fact that someone defecated on the ground I understand that the owner and the staff are not to blame but I think it shows who goes there since this is the first club where I see this
Nice place and good to drink a czeck beer However If you at looking for craftbeer i dont think that you should Go there
Huge bar and very nice staff I had the impression that 50 of people sitting there at 11pm were drunk but maybe this is how it looks like in czech bars 
Great kind and friendly service good beer and most importantly atmosphere not mached by any other place in Ostrava Its kind of a rock and roll club  always swarming with some kine of nerdy cool rock indie clientell
In one night I explore some cute and nice pubs in townthis was one of them  Thy dont have a craft beerbut they said the are about to open a new pub next to itso Im gonna check out soon
Tam je super nonstop
Super
Super hospoda
Super
great place great atmosphere  and even better service
Great place The owner is very friendly and an awesome guy  I went there alone and got introduced to a bunch of his friends Good food and alcohol selection As a foreigner I felt welcome and they gave me a good experience in Ostrava Highly recommend
This is a friendly pub The owner is fluent in English and almost always present when the place is open Quality beer with comparable prices for the location
Good service Went on a Thursday evening  Outside is nice Inside is dark if you like that style Needs some updating inside  Bathrooms were mostly clean
My one of the very favourite cosy and chill pub Nothing disco more alternative with old radios styled interior included with music jukebox which should be updated with more music but its ok Definitely recommended if you want to have a philosophical chat with friends and drink beer or booze There is a good selection of beers
Nice environment Usually it is full but on the other hand you allways find place for 2 or 3 people They have not traditional beers If you look for something different with cool people then this is right place for you  Prijemne prostredi Obvykle byva plno ale na druhou stranu misto pro 2 az 3 lidi se najde Maji i netradicni piva na cepu Pokud hledate neco jineho se super lidmi tak toto je misto pro vas
Very cool bar Highly recommend Very tasty chees
Perfect alternative pub Alternative beers usualy young and smart people comming in Dont expect posh service here but nice and friendly service
We came from cracow to visit this bar because a friend of mine really recommended it So localization is pretty good 5 min from city center and next to Stodolni street which is the most popular street in ostrava with bars and etc We came on Monday so there was only one couple apart from us In this bar you can smoke shisha and get some drinks Shisha was really good beer also The girl whos working there was extremely nice to us Prices are acceptable So i can recommend you this bar but not on monday unless you are looking for almost empty place
If you are looking for a place to chill out with really delicious shisha  tasty drinks I believe youre in the best place in Ostrava
Cool Place Fair pricing Nice mix of people good selection of shisha lots of drinks and cocktails to choose Friendly staff Tomas is very attentive
Cozy interior great place to meet up with friends wide selection of drinks great background music highly recommend this place
Super
We had a voucher from Slevomat for chicken and strips We also had beers water and a mixed drink Drinks ok but food was not edible Fries very greasy salads with rotten vegetables and strips burnt on the surface and raw inside We claimed the meat on the spot About 30 minutes later the attendant brought us new strips the same black as the previous ones The staff responded to our surprised reaction by saying that the strips cannot be baked better because they are a semifinished product It is said that the cook fried them slowly so they are definitely not raw anymore We were hungry so we carefully peeled the meat from the disaster and finally ate it I definitely do not recommend to anyone
Catastrophe Today I ordered from this restaurant for the first time and I know that I will never do it again The burger was in a terrible condition after the first bite I found out that the meat was not done So I put it away and thank the restaurant very much for the wellmade meat and that Im hungry today and I probably dont need to comment on the fact that fries cost 59 CZK and there are 11 of them The photos probably say it all
On Friday I was at the Kenken restaurant and I had a burger and it was excellent everything was perfectly seasoned and cooked it was brought to us by a pleasant and smiling waitress I felt very nice and comfortable here 100 satisfaction for me and I will definitely come again
Really nice little bar run by hoppy dog brewery of Vtkovice Their own beers on tap plus guests and some interesting beers in the fridge Staff were accommodating of our bad Czech Liked it a lot
Do you want a beer Just stop by Homemade brewary with good offer is not gonna dissapoint you Prices are slightly higher but thats the costs for quality Na zdrav
A cool place They have live music quite often and I really enjoy the atmosphere It is quite small so sitting is an issue The staff was very nice
A nice beer place in the center of Ostrava owned by HoppyDog a local microbrewery specializing in topfermented beers They also offer one lager in the pub but its certainly focused on alelovers The interior is really basic but beers are delicious and staff friendly
Super
Unpleasant service sitting by the main road half an hour before closing time they no longer have beer on tap
For me its a great place the service is also good a very nice attitude thats how it should be
Care of beer storage of barrels cleanliness of pipes regular weekly chemical professional cleaning rinsing with water after each barrel a big tap and an evening ceremony with a brush for total cleaning finished by polishing the tap and covering it with a personal towel I dont know the restaurant or the pub  where they tap beer with more responsibility and love To eat a carefully selected sausage the heating of which is monitored by the staff or ermine luxuriously laid out or a properly drowned drowned all this with a large garnish and fresh again carefully selected bread In addition the price is more than reasonable Sports broadcasts on TV And the beer is drawn with love In my opinion this is the ceiling and an example of what one should expect from a pub
One of our very favorite places We kept going back We love the beers The atmosphere is great Live music is fantastic So many kinds of music Cider bar also caught our attention and we tried so many
Looks like a nice place but neither bartender spoke English  Finally got a Schwartz in one of the descriptions so had a dark lager
Nice pub good atmosphere and music
Nice ambiance  music with a band quick and affordable with a good decoration However its small so if you intend to go with friends  come early  
What an amazing place Highly recommended Tap beer and cyder you can also have a table with a self serving yes you have a beer tap for yourself Staff is beyond friendly all of them specially jakub Viki Hanka and Tereza hope spelling is OK Two times in here and definitely coming back
I had the privilege of drinking a couple mugs of Pilsner here The bartender was friendly spoke good English and did not mind answering our dumb tourist questions We needed beer and wanted to check out the local scene and this place hit the spot I would come back
Very nice for celebrating eg bachelor parties and drinking a lot of self drafted beer with motivation display device  Surprisingly good burgers
Nice pub atmosphere and great bartenders made my visit very pleasant I had angus steak and it was excellent They also offer the best choices of beers
Excellent customer service They provide you personalized drinks and have a lot of good spirits If you enjoy a good cognac or good rum  you will find happiness They can do almost everything you want They speak English good to know for foreigners and are really kindred bartender Professional Everything I like
Went tonight for a quick drink with a new friend Im a whiskey girl and usually cant find the type I like in bars here in Plze  The bartender Jarda I believe totally knew his stuff  I told him the type of whiskey I like and he recommended a new one Id never heard of  Perfect match  Super friendly bartender and speaks good English  Really liked the large outdoor area they have too  Good vibes here
Great selection of drinks Unfortunately the prices are extremely expensive 90 of the clients are men
Great coctails and service
Super
New bar nice place with comfortable seating at the bar or tables cosy nice selection of drinks and I like that we can play pool for free The girl behind the bar was nice He was playing a playlist of 70s remixes when we were there
Its great there perfect service great drinks just everything great everyone should visit this bar AND THERE IS A FREE POOL
Very cool bar with friendly staff Specially for us guests from Germany Bundesliga So that we dont miss anything a second game was also played on the iPad
Great atmosphere and staff who are knowledgeable and will advise you when choosing a whiskey that is really great Guinness was excellent Thanks for a nice evening 
We were with friends before the end of the year to sit in this Irish pub and I can only recommend it As soon as we arrived we sat down at the bar and tuned in to the wave of Irish mood  The service was excellent We tried all kinds of beer they have here Two Irish beers and then beer from the brewery Primtor and Svijan Pickled ermine excellent The knee looked great too So great
This bar was an unexpected very pleasant surprise on our trip to Liberec A stylishly furnished Irish Pub where you can get great draft Guinness and a rich selection of excellent whiskeys and rums displayed on the wall directly behind the bar Yes even a wall like this completes the right atmosphere  My girlfriend and I sat right behind the bar and it was a good choice The local bartender gives the whole place the much needed other half of that great atmosphere and bar life He had fun with us and the other guests all evening and recommended great whiskey I also praise the excellent Shepherds pie  I definitely recommend this Pub to everyone who likes the Irish atmosphere and likes to have fun at the bar with great whiskey
A really cool and modern western style business I appreciate that it is possible to find something like this in the city of Liberec However I dont mean anything bad by that on the contrary In most Czech cities there is no such company The great atmosphere the excellently decorated space is complemented by the omnipresent cleanliness the selection of great drinks  I personally have to especially appreciate the Magners on tap which you really dont come across just like that The service is at the highest level Sympathetic correct and attentive There is also a garden here I have nothing to complain about
You wont say wow but you aint leaving hungry either
Food was delicious  a lot beer choices But  beer was little bit undersized
When asked for a place I was ignored and left standing as a single guest something Ive never experienced before
One of the best burgers plus good service
good music good beer attentive and nice staff 
Syper
Ok
Always a wonderful atmosphere friendly professional service that never keeps you waiting Excellent food I recommend the Chutney burger and above all a wide range of all kinds of cocktails and drinks just about anything you can think of In addition the staff can perfectly advise on the choice of cocktail depending on what you are in the mood for I like it In short this place shows that the owner really cares about all the details The best place far and wide and I hereby thank the entire team of Ponorka bar 
great serviceand pretty too 
Super
Regular bar for late night or early morning drinking
Hmmmm
Amazing drinks great food A bit pricier place You can park right in front of it paid before 6pm Reservations needed during weekend Great service
Quite tasty drinks Perfect for some team building activities
I was at the Jungle Gin yesterday I was served by I very nice girl her name was Valeria she served us with a nice smile and professional way I had a visitors from Prague they really liked the bar and the service and they said they will come next weekend 
Very cool  Update for 2020  For me the best bar in the town Great beer great gin if you like that kind of thing food looks fantastic and unusual Asian infused dishes Great staff fast service and cool vibes  Perfect for alone or with others
Zajdem na pivo do Vokna a vichni vd kde se sejdeme Regionln pivn specily vdejn oknko a dav postvajc ped Voknem to je co mete ekat
Vokno  translating as Window Good beer pub currently working with new small brewery from Jablonec nad Nisou  Volt Decent beer selection and good quality In hot weather possible to sit outside in the shade of nearby plane trees
Great pub with selection of local beers and friendly staff
My favorite spot in Liberec centre Stop this Pilsner Only bullsht and try out beers from local brewery Volt 
I was here for the first time and it was for a private event I have nothing to complain about on the contrary great and pleasant service excellent food nice environment I recommend it to everyone 
We were there today September 23 2023 I have to say that I have never seen better service Perfect communicative accommodating just perfect The food was great we had a steak and a burger and it was impossible to eat it Really excellent just like the fries theyve become stale somewhere but the meat was excellent and well made Prices are normal
Great cuisine very nice and fast service Even though we didnt have a reservation and it was St Martins evening they still took good care of us Kaldoun soup  thats Top soup  Thank you very much and many satisfied customers
Absolutely the best steaks not only in Liberec amazing environment perfect service even the owner himself serves when needed Amazing just a perfect gastronomic experience I recommend it 110
Nice barpub with table football and darts Good drink selection
A good place to vibe 
Decent bar loads of drinks Pilsen and some home beer There is a terrace at the back where you can smoke
Super service and a pleasant environment with an amazing range of drinks 
Nice undergroud place
Underground 
Stamina forever
I  this place
I highly recomend The food is very tasty everything arrived hot its not overpriced the staff is very kind and pleasant The waitress even came back to our table with onion rings they forgot to put on top of our burgers The only downside is the fact that theyre understaffed so the service is a bit slower but overall it was a great experience
Good service and food We had burgers and they were pretty delicious
Good place nice people goed meals for a good price
We celebrated my daughters birthday today in style I mean indoors Her father highly recommended that we order food from Burger Grill Pub as he is familiar with thier delicious international kitchen  and he was absolutely right with his recommendation I was pleasantly surprised with their delicious marinated chicken wings with steak chips and spicey burger The food was plentiful and amazingly delicious it was just something you dont usually find in Czech restaurants We enjoyed the food so much and will definitely make Burger Grill Pub our restaurant because their food is just amazingly delicious  So happy we stayed at home and ordered the food from them and oh they do takeaways too so it makes things even easier for those who prefer to have their food delivered directly from the restaurant to the comfort of their homes
A local affair with a long tradition Beer will do if you have a standard Konrad They also have events for specialties such as Polika but that is always rather disappointing for me or a big lottery There is some food to go with the beer During the day they probably have something from the restaurant next door The service depends on the specific person it can be good or not
A traditional local pub with a large terrace frequented especially in the summer months Outdoor terrace without attendant delivery from the window Beers Polika Konrad  light dark bottled Pilsen Snacks pickled Hermelin sausage etc Seating inside less comfortable
The best evening of my life Mainly thanks to Jirko behind the bar who knows how to make the evening a completely unforgettable experience Epic beer
A classic pub with a special beer from a small brewery on tap every week A big plus for a garden with a large number of places
The place where legends come to life and Mr Boring goes to sleep Phenomenal service that will always help you A wide selection of drinks world brands and above all unrivaled music If you want to keep driving at five in the morning I dont know of a better business than this one
3 for nostalgia Its not and probably wont be what it used to be
Nice staff normal prices great selection of alcohol it could be cleaner
For the atmosphere unless there is a pako that gets everyone going
Excellent cocktails and service and the dcor is simply lovely
great drinks
A great bar in Hradec Krlov the drinks were excellent and we learned interesting information about everyone the service is very professional This is really a bar on the level and if you want to experience what you are drinking you have to go here
The best bar in Hradec Krlov Nothing better or even of similar quality can be found here Absolutely delicious drinks It is a great experience in terms of taste aroma and serving It is complemented by a calm and pleasant atmosphere I can only recommend
Nice pub right in the centre of beautiful Hradec Krlov its spacious which is nice if youre usually out with herd of friends Also couple of my friends are musicians and here we are allowed to dunkplay guitars D
At this place there were plenty of pubs out of which bancrupted quite soon after opening But U stolu is quite cosy pub which takes only fraction of area of previous pubs you will understand when you go to toilet It is simple place but good for a beer and a snack
Staff was friendly and service was good One of the waiters speaks very good English and is super nice I would say a good pub spot for sure
Cash only
The environment is very special the garden is a great place Visitors from another world In popular terms its a place where they have cheap good beer and a nice garden
Perfect location where I like to go for a beer after work
Good new beer on tap Radegast 12 and still G10 and K11 And above all from June 2022 a new Polstrin interior
Cheap and the interior looks like it but a nice garden outside
If you want a good classical pub this is your place Expect little higher prices but nice chilled atmosphere
Great beer choice and picked cheese tvarky
A cozy pub and if you feel like Jedno  Wider selection of several beers You have to taste each one so you actually always have one  Fast and friendly service  tasty and you can bite into some delicacy in the form of ermine or drowning A classic in the form of super Raspberry
Thank you for the pub where you can have an excellent beer As a beer drinker I can warmly recommend 
They dont accept credit cards there is no food options and terrible service Very not recommended There are better places around
Cash only

Best place
When I went out in st I didnt know that the last train back to Prague leaves this city so early So I stayed out for the night I looked around the hotel and asked for a taxi driver And he took me to Moskevsk Street to the hotel where they had fully booked for a group that listens to swing  Im moving on another door Probably average children I think when in this look Rap sounds from that funny window You probably enter there through the house There are no other doors here The hallway of that house doesnt stink but its dark  In the garden of Pivnice Hamburg I introduced myself as the new one and enjoyed the great soundtrack I painted a picture of how I discovered this bar I later dedicated that painting to Fefe at Radio 23 in Pragues Cross club who took it to Pivnice Hamburg in st See Ya
An almost legendary pub with long opening hours no one expects any luxury here but it certainly has its regulars
Ok
Super

It is a pub from which one does not expect anything luxurious However its quiet here relatively settled people gather here so there are no rearends and they have good beer
A normal local pub without food something to drink nuts salty bars etc Good for a chat
Reasonable beer choices  very much liked the Budvar variants service was fine Otherwise not a particularly exciting venue Had football on when i was there which is by no means a bad thing but did make for a 100 male clientele
Good place for enjoy to the good beer 
good choice of beer of many not well known breweries
Great place with good beers

The staff is really helpful and polite We have a great time everytime we visit this bar and grill restaurant The atmosphere and all the vibes are really good Perfect place to watch football match and drink some beer The burgers are on fire Many different choices The fries are local and fresh The only thing i do not recommend is the wrap it was a little bit of dry It would be better if i have a choice to add any sauce inside
So I ordered a pork chop and it took me ages to chew It was over cooked and I sent back more than the half There was no apology nothing And when I asked the waitress if she informed the kitchen they told me the kitchen said it was okay maybe she only didnt like it  such an unprofessional attitude Good for drinks but I wouldnt suggest pork chop
Excellent service tasty food nice atmosphere
The atmosphere is quite nice and the staff are very helpful and kind however the food needs some quality improvement I personally had the chicken fajita for 1430 and the portion size was ridiculously small It was closer to a starter rather than a main course and im not even a big eater Additionally all the meals we ordered had an insane amount of salt and pepper The burgers were too dry and overcooked and the buns werent anything special I would suggest some improvement on the menu

This cozy bar has left the best impressions Hospitable hosts great dishes and quality live music throughout the night I recommend to everyone going with a group of friends as a couple or even single The atmosphere is chill and cool  I highly recommend
This bar is one of the best bars I have ever been to Service was excellent waiter was so sweet and attentive The cocktails delicious and the 2 people band was amazing The guys were so talentedjust perfect I couldnt recommend it more I will definitely visit again
Loved the experience A great host and lovely music to keep your senses engaged between the awesome drink and local drink
We were very impressed with the cocktails their chicken fajitas were also very delicious We also found the staff extremely attentive and very polite The live music was fantasticWe had a great time and we will be back again
Too loud cant ficking sleep
classic metalhead bar
Great experience
Awesome
Trying the brunch menu Variety of dishes such as croque madame salmon tortilla sweet and savoury pancakes
Great sports bar to chill with the boys and have a porkchop or burger and beers The chicken wings as a starter is highly recommended  crispy and flavorful
Overall a descent sports bar i wasnt impressed nor disappointed The place lacks of coziness i would say it reminded me of a cheap version of other quality sports bar in nicosia To the cons the food was tasteless and quite expensive for its quality To the pros the very good service and the people working there in general very helpful and friendly
One of my favorite restaurants The stuff very friendly always happy to serve you The food is delicious and fresh as always You should try it Also the best place for football matches 
Great cozy place to have fun at night Best quality drinks with great staff the atmosphere was astonishingly calm
Great service  music The waiter is really Nice
Best bar in Famagusta which makes amazing coffee as well Has lots of alcohol coffee  tea selection De Molay Bar comes with a history so just sitting there makes you feel special Also dont miss the live music nights there is always a cosy environment both in summer and winter Animal friendly
Amazing place historical and greates cocktails in town
thought it will be better
They changed it to passage cafe
Cosy pub
loved it yo
Really love this place and happy to still see it here  the bar staff are very attentive and friendly  Highly recommend this to anyone for a welcoming atmosphere 
Good cocktails   Acceptable environment
Good drinks Nice place to hang out and try good cocktails Not crazy expensive But not a place to dance Recommended  for a drink and a chat Cool place for a date since the name of the drinks can start a fun conversations
Great place to have a coctail There are a lot to choose from intresting drinks name and good prices I liked that music wasnt too loud and we coukd talk with each other
Drinks Atmosphere View Staff and specially the live music oh my God i love it
Great vibe and friendly staff
Seats was not comfortable
Its beautiful from the outside but when you get inside things change First of all there is no interest in customers no smiling faces there is rudeness Dont do that thats enough Those people come to have fun and have a good time You dont have the right to treat anyone badly Customers If you are not satisfied whatever you do is of no use Its a very bad place Dont even go
very cool bar one of my favorite places nice prices delicious food great selection of beer great selection of snack plates great service
Amazing place with hospitable owners and great drinks Location is also great right by the main street The best selection of local and imported beers The service was fast and the prices were fair Would recommend it and come again
A beautifully decorated lounge barrestaurant in the well known Ledra street in the heart of Nicosia Chreers has a very large bar with extensive list of beers winesand other drinks They also serve food of the highest quality with an excellent service Cheers also have many tables and chairs outside all arranged for the full enjoyment of Customers The place is very popular with locals and Tourists alike I highly recommend Cheers for its unique atmosphere
We like this place Good price for draft beer there is draft Guinness KEO and more There are also had Belgian beer as Kriek on the menu It seems like a quiet place to me I dont smoke but also they have a hookah
It was really nice for a Saturday lunch only thing that there was a big group of people and more than half of them were children and they werent behaving running around making noise so we actually couldnt feel the exact bar experience this time  Apart from this unlucky detail the food was better than the previous times Beer choices are good the tap beers were cold as they should be The service personnel is friendly smiling and polite For sure we will visit again for a burgerbeer date 
A really nice place to get great beer and Burgers They have a huge selection of beers both national and international bottled and on tap They have several burgers and other meals but we only had burgers and they have a big selection from one to three patty burgers
Big variety of beer tasty fries huge burgers But burger with beef and prawns  extremely strange at least peel prawns before serving please
If you have already arrived in Nicosia or if you even moved there this is the meat restaurant you must visit and eat at a very tasty restaurant with a very wide variety of beers from all over the world you can also watch football matches there highly recommend
Good place Foods are tasty Staffs behaviour also great Just food pricing a little bit higher in my perspective
It was cool Recommended Nice food clean  good hospitality
Its not confortable for disable peoples
Good music nice personal
So here is the magic We have been there for 20 minutes to have someone walk to our table to take an order After a few attempts waving out hands and shouting for someone to come to our table  Took like 1015 mins for the first beer to arrive and 10 more for the rest Even though we were like 5 people instead of bringing all of the drinks on one or two attempts  After all us arrived 13 more minutes for the water and one more beer counted on the clock to arrive  There was literally no music on half of the place and the other half had 1 or 2 speakers to cover the area so you can imagine how loud people talking was isted  This is the last time i visit this pub Not really anything against the stuff but more likely bad management
Nice place  great music unfortunately a lot of the people there smoke inside I had pay for my drink and leave after just 10 minutes
Even though the place has a huge  covered and heated smoking area outdoors everyone including the bartender is smoking INSIDE Also I find it really disturbing that they have a huge picture of Mussolini on their wall Will not come back and definitely dont recommend if you dont like to be smoked like in 2007
Many choices of beer good atmosphere and service  BUT  Weve been asked if we are paying revolut or normal card We said revolut and they told us that we have to transfer money to an account  and thats their policy 
casual sports pub with good food and  places inside for those who dont go there for football You still have 20 TVs inside but its ok Food is good and prices passable pork chop is huge and well cooked Angus Burgers are on the expensive side but my husband liked his I found the beef meat a bit smelly Happy hour 5 to 730 for beers makes a difference
The food is really good Very tasty good portions and high quality The Cowboy burger was very nice and tasty although the chicken burger was not that great and a little dry The curly fries are amazing 
An excellent experience especially when you are a football fan The perfect spot to hang out with the boys and enjoy your time together Service was extremely fast and friendly and the atmosphere was amazing A large catalogue of beers to choose from and the food was decently priced and tasty Overall a great experience Would recommend for sure
Been to this place a few times and it is always a good experience I like their wide variety of many different types of beer their carefully selected menu dishes great service and amazing Shisha Parking space also provided next to the bar for convenience
Great atmosphere in a nice hidden garden in Nicosia since 1993 Staff were fantastic and the service was very fast  Food was authentic and tasted great A big variety of beers and drinks 
Nice atmosphere and decent food If you are looking for something casual and relaxed this is the place
Nice atmosphere but I did not like the food at all and the staff got wrong order and in addition was very rude  thanks for your reply  Let me just clarify that your young waiter pretended to memorise all the order without writing it down and then he got it wrong and pretended to be right By the way I never ordered a chicken tandoori or a kozel Maybe it was other client
Babylon is a traditional barpub housed in an old 60s style house with a great garden The indoor decor is wall to wall music legends There is a pool table a fireplace and an impressive and stylish wooden bar The garden area is lush and verdant filled with wooden picnic tables Trees and shrubbery adorn the perimetre of the garden giving a city oasis feel The food is a blend of pub food and Cypriot cuisine with American and Mexican tones They have an extensive beer and whiskey selection and great music They also have large tvs featuring major sporting events Overall Babylon is a city haven with great food a relaxing ambiance and good food
I was a regular 4 years ago and everything was very nice People Drinks and even their Kitchen with a very nice food Now  today on the 17th of November 2023 thinks are a bit different it is still a nice place to be but only for drinks they are expensive but anyway that is life everything went up  But their Kitchen needs a lot of improvement starting with the head I will give a good rating for their service 910 Their kitchen get a minus rating thought This is my opinion
We went there tonight to try the burgers After we tried them we realized why all of our friends were talking about this pub  Excellent food amazing service and the atmosphere is what we are calling pub Price its very good compare to the quality  We will visit again soon
Great restaurant to enjoy amazing food with a a vast variety of beers and many other spirits  Perfect rock music and very helpful staff  I would suggest pork chop any burger from their menu or the steak sandwich  You can also watch football matches there highly recommend  The restaurant also offers free parking space for its visitors
B R Hub is located near Strovolos area I would highly recommend it for people who wants to eat and watch their football games  One of the best burgers I have ever eaten in this kind of concept restaurant Waitress were amazing and really helpful to choose the best possible option for us Keep in mind to book a table otherwise you will wait to be seated Definitely 1010 highly recommended
Late review but I have to say its an amazing shop with great taste in music As I said we will definitely go again I highly recommend it

A great place with jazzsoulrock music and a vast selection of beers The service was very good and the food was tasty I would also add a plate of nachos  Overall it was a very nice experience and we are definitely coming back for more 
Warm and cozy atmosphere and its also very relaxing since theres rarely many people so you can easily enjoy your time with your friends or company If you like lowkey bars where you wont find crowds and noises definitely give Platos a try
Great place yard decoration atmosphere food service One of the most impressive drinks collection and definitely one of the very few places in Nicosia to listen to such a good and inspiring music
One of the oldest bars in Nicosia Has a huge variety of beers to choose from The prices are a bit high But the environment is very warm and cozy
Small bar with live music Really cosy and the entertainment escales fast Service was good Vibe was fab people dancing Singers where good too
This is a very small self labelled live music bar Absolutely basic decoration as this used to house a frozen yoghurt place Whats the attraction Some young singers try to recreate a bouzouki place in an extremely small place perhaps no bigger than 100sqm crammed with tables and early 20s clients It opens late after 1130 and stays open very late with people coming and going all the time Is it good Yes for a couple of drinks after an initial partying somewhere else Extremely smoky air One of the singers is good The other is ok if you continue with some more drinks
Other than a bit of a struggle to find parking everything was great 
Great live Greek music

Nice and warm place  The staff is very polite and willing to serve you  We tried the chicken skewer which was very soft and very tasty  We also tried one of the burgers and it was one of the tastiest burgers we have ever eaten  It also has a large variety of beers
Nice atmosphere and the customer service is great Also very satisfied when it comes to food portions
Its a nice bar and grill Friendly staff Got a lot of beers on tap not just the regular KEO or Carlsberg which is great Scrumptious platters We ordered the Blooms platter for three people and it was very satisfying and fulfilling Another big plus is the large parking right next to it which in Nicosia is a rare thing Will recommend to others and definitely will visit again and again
Excellent burgers and pork chop and salads Extremely good value for the quality and quantity of food Love the cocktails as well The space itself is fine but the tables outside could be more comfortable ie a footrest given the high chairs The service is quick and most people working there are courteous and attentive I highly recommend this barrestaurant 
Nice sports bar Great platters Superb atmosphere Went there with a bunch of people for a birthday party so didnt pay anything I tried their pinacolada It was delicious but perhaps can use a bit more alcohol Someone had a margarita but they kinda messed up by not putting salt on the glass rim Although they made amends by making a right one on the house Platters are superbly hearty and om nom nom quality I just had a quick look at the drinks menu and the prices were all right too Only thing is that some sports like tennis or UFC dont have sounds on Perhaps they can make that into a big night because Cyprus has a very large UFC and tennis fan base  4 and half stars
Great American bar and grill with fun atmosphere Burgers for the carnovores salads for the vegetarians Good variety
Food is ok took a bit longer to be served Staff is friendly Music is too loud to chat without yelling
Excellent food polite staff pleasant environment Only issue  the music was too loud

Perfect bar with an amazing staff Girl with the red hair  Stefanie is absolutely the best Also make sure to try the cocktail with their traditional cyprus schnappas It gives you the perfect kick for the rest of the night 
If youre looking for a place where to relax and be halara  this caf would be the best They have the best coffee available in the area  and even some fresh baked goods as well The ambiance of this shop was so warming and the staff is highly capable  helpful and fast  I could not ask for more because everything that I needed was provided Well done guys PS  They have the best homemade soft drinks last time  i had the homemade strawberry lemonade that was delish  I truly recommend it
Cozy spot next to the historic Faneromeni church Perfect for sitting down and having drinks with good company Provides food and drinking options for the whole day
Casual mood and rock Very dirty toilet We take meze and beers
The food portions in this place are massive and the cocktails are very reasonably priced  The biggest letdown was that they allowed smokers to puff away indoors It really let the place down and stopped us from using the bar more Shame 
Lovely place food n drinks great staff brilliant especially Dana who gives great service but as a chat with everyone and a laugh
Happy hour cocktails for 300 euros 50 cents Nice bar friendly staff Football shown on tvs music great atmosphere
Verry friendly staff wonderful cocktails low price all is perfekt
What a fantastic pub Owner staff really look after you especially the owner who would always find you a table  Turns really good very varied  Karaoke  really good fun hubby loved getting up and having fun   Meals very tasty ate here a few times Cant wait to return in September and have some more gun night Would highly recommend this place 
Called in on a boiling hot day for a bit of shade and a cold drinkand ended up staying for food too Great table service we had our order for drinks taken as soon as we sat down Good variety of drinks on offer at good prices We decided to take the opportunity for some food while there as the weather so hot that day about 39c and it was lovely and cool inside Wait for the food was not long at all and I thoroughly enjoyed my burger and chips it was the nicest one of the holiday in a toasted brioche bun and the bonus of fried onions Winner I can definitely recommend Rives 
Great bar live entertainment and good old karaokepool table good fun bar for a few cocktails and a drink
We made plans to come to Rives while on a kidfree date night for a couple of drinks We were pleased to see that the ABBA performers were scheduled the same night Very fun atmosphere Good music Good time
Spend quite a few nights at Teejays over the 2 weeks holiday Really friendly staff great music and nice atmosphere In our opinion it was definitely the best bar on the strip Hopefully see you all again next year Please keep our table 27 free for us Following on from last years review we have just returned from our holiday this year and would like to add that yet again Teejays was just brill Definitely the best staff So warm and friendly  I would also like to say a special thank you to Jo the owner who helped make my husbands special birthday a really great night for all the family Keep doing what you do Thanks again and hope to see you all next year
Best bar in protaras great atmosphere great service staff go out of way to make you welcome Tony and Joanne great hosts couldnt wish for a better place to be  for a pint of perroni and a wine and a chat great bar roll on next year we be back jelly totts in hand Kim and John
We called in for lunch  Home made steak pie and bolognese Was ok Portion sizes too large and being told off waitress your eyes to big for your belly as some food was left is not good service  understandably a joke however when she took order perhaps advise customers  Had called in previous for drinks  Prices are reasonable for the area in Protarus
My friends  an I have been to teejays every night of our holiday  it is a fantastic place so friendly  the owners Tony  and Joanne  are amazing has are the staff bonny Alex cice neno all fantastic  they cant do enough for you I would highly recommend a visit they looked after us sad to have to  go home today but will be back September  so big thanks from the 4 men from wrexham North wales
The burger was really avarage if not less it missed sauce and was dry The local Cyprus meatballs on the other had were very good 
Cant overstate the beauty and cosiness of this place Very glad and pleasant personell speaking multiple languages Kind and responsive attitude and flexible to adjustments in servings Incredible Chef and awesome food This place was my goto lunch spot and I ate half my lunches there during my stay Fine music fans for bearable eating environment and lots of flowers made it an all in all a 5 star experience in my opinion
Food was very average  Almost tastelessservice could have been betterdidnt even ask how my meal was Guess they know betterhouse wine was the worst I have had in Cyprus All round disappointed
Good food nice place for kids to play
Our host as always very welcoming to all our family The food is reasonably priced and of great quality The cocktails are a treat Also sending our thanks as we had to have our villa vacated by 11 oclock and were a little worried leaving our cases we were offered free storage Hope to see our good friend again in the near future
Great bar Great team made you feel very welcome and looked after you Nice pint of beer too
Great food friendly staff and a rich selection of drinks
Cocktails are lovely and you can definitely taste the alcohol in them so you know they are not stingy with the portions Only downside for me was the music terrible mixing from the dj and the volume kept going up to deafening levels then dropping to reasonable levels We like to be able to talk to each other while we are drinking not having to shout at each other
Great promoters those guys should really get a raise but really nice warm up for night out  All this was for 20 euros
Great bar Here the cocktails taste so good and not so sugary or watery like in other bars nearby Recommended it 100 percent
Sagar was a legend  he is the best promoter in ayia napa He and his friends in the service jabar shakil are really welcoming and do their job very well They made our trip But the manager is terrible
Sagar heromone bar ayis napa Hes the best promoter i ever meet and he gives great deals Definetly would recomend to visit this barclub
Nice place  good atmosphere decent prices
Good wee bar drink was same price as elsewhere located near the main barsclubs cant rate the food as didnt have any or see any
Amazing atmosphere DJ is a legend music was banging Drink prices are decent Always guaranteed to have a great night
Its Class Al yell u what if your not a craigs bar your getting off way children ya beast FACTS if your not coming its because you are too busy kissing minors
We stopped here for a few drinks the service was quick and friendly
Rockerfellas Bar with its expansive space and vibrant atmosphere seems to be a hotspot particularly during the nighttime It attempts to draw in crowds with its extensive sports theme showcasing a myriad of games and live entertainment a factor that distinguishes it amidst other bars  While its cleanliness and theme were commendable the experience unfortunately fell short when it came to the actual beverages The beer served was disappointingly warm and the cocktails lacked the finesse and balance one would anticipate from such a bustling venue  We gave the place a couple of tries predinner and at lunchtime hoping for a change in experience but it remained consistent in its mediocrity in terms of drinks Despite passing by regularly and witnessing the live entertainment it lacked the allure to draw us in compared to surrounding venues  Overall while the venue has its perks with cleanliness and a wellexecuted sports theme the quality of the drinks primarily informs the lower score For a place teeming with potential the disappointment in the beverage department was a significant letdown If youre looking to immerse yourself in sports and entertainment it might be worth a visit but temper your expectations when it comes to the drinks  Enjoyed this review Hit the like button and follow for more honest insights on local spots
Best Mai Tai in Protaras Great music acts albeit a little kitch but hey youre  on holiday Reasonable prices and attentive staff Even put my supermarket purchases in the fridge so we could stay a while longer before heading back to the villa

I visited Moodz a few times while in the Paralimni region I found the restaurant to be extremely clean well run and the was excellent but at a fair price Steve and Gaynor were very warm and welcoming We will definitely be going back

Best bar in Ayia Napa Owner is a gentleman amazing service and drinks really great prices Would recommend to anyone in Ayia Napa
Lovely service excellent drinks and very chilled out great place for a game of pool and a cool down
Very nice and cozy bar The drinks are really cheap compared to the rest of the bars and if you put in a good word at the bartender you can often choose a track to play
Andreas excellent host  he knows his drinks and cocktails  best bar in ayia napa

We went there to watch world cup rugby so didnt consider food Atmosphere was electric and we had a great time
It is a perfect place where you can drink a really good Guinness listen to good music and have a good time The owner of the place Adrian is very kind and concerned thank you very much
A lovely genuine Irish bar Adrian the owner is a lovely guy very welcoming and chatty Will definitely be back
Great spot Very welcoming Proper Irish pub in showing Gaelic games even opening to do so on a Sunday
They gave me coffee without water Usually they gave standard water by coffee when you orderIts a trick they do that if you ask they will charge mineral water bottle For the rest its nice place to sit in the sun
I went in for a coffee and was greeted with very unpleasant waitress Asked for direction around the area to be given the smarty answer asking am I being serious She was very rude and unpleasant I thought maybe she was having a bad day but after reading reviews here I realized it is a regular thing and I will definitely not be returning Also there was not sign of not taking cards
Great pub Great athmosphere Big and modern terrace with big screens to watch premier league on Lots of options Cocktails are great and staff works hard and is very friendly Great prices also
Perfect place for a cold beer It is very cheap and can sit a lot of people Great service all though a little slow We had a great time They also show sports on TVs Located on a great street with many restaurants
Best place in town super beer super fast service

Great selection of draft beers Belgium ones being the best obv
The pub Legenda an unassuming little gem hidden away just a stones throw from the bustling city center offers a soothing escape from the heat and chaos of urban life Set amid the lush greenery of ancient chestnut trees this cozy establishment is the perfect spot to unwind with a glass of beer or a shot of raki the local favorite spirit  As you step into the cool shade of the pub the natural ambience and friendly service immediately make you feel at home The lack of snacks on the menu is easily forgiven when you experience the refreshing quality of the beverages on offer While the selection of draft beer may be limited to just one type the chosen brew is a delightful and satisfying accompaniment to the laidback atmosphere of the pub  The simplicity of Legend Pubs offerings is one of its greatest charms The unpretentious lowkey vibe allows patrons to focus on what truly matters  enjoying a refreshing drink and good conversation in a serene welcoming environment This is a place where visitors can relax mingle with locals and truly experience the essence of the citys character  In conclusion Legend Pub is a delightful oasis for those seeking a break from the bustling city center Though the food and drink options may be limited the quality and atmosphere more than make up for it If you find yourself in the area be sure to stop by for a glass of beer or a shot of raki and soak in the tranquility that only the shade of chestnuts can provide
Great place with great atmosphere Excellent coffee and good beer selection They also have pool and darts if youre into that Worth a visit Moderate prices too
Amazing next door pub to sit in  Drinks are very good and v friendly staff

choice of beer is terrible every beer I tried tasted oxidized like its way past expiration date
The best staff d the whole world N never felt so welcome in any country I love Croatia so much because of this bro and I am swear if you dont come here you never get a full Croatian experience so thankful for everyone I meant here Best prices too xo
This is a self service bar I dont have anything against that but the bartenders that helped me were rude At least the beer is cheap and the terrace is nice  EDIT OMG Even rude to my review I am not a tourist I live in Zagreb for many years and the bar had many tourists around me the day I was there Anyway that is the wrong mentality to run a business Terrible place and terrible management
Great pub draft beer very good and unique service with fun atmosphere specially if Joseph is there Dont miss the kebab it is amazing
Loud place but the waitress is very nice and they have a great palette of Pelinkovac to choose from
Nice old pub is a lovely small pub situated in the old town hidden from the touristy restaurants and bars  The prices are ok for Zagreb  the waiter was not smiling but he was very honest I asked for wine and he said the wine isnt good because the place serves beer The toilets were fairly clean
New management Now a family business Tolkiens has had a staff refresh a style glow up and is back to slay xx
I was there just tonight and had a very friendly and informing chat with the lad who was running the pub Great time great beer certainly coming again if I can
Nice atmosphere local beers good advices from the bartender whats not to love 
Lovely atmosphere Huge place with many sit areas Great for groups Very well decorated with all old pharmacy memorabilia  People do make reservations here
Cool pub Beautifully decorated and had a really cosy atmosphere Nice staff and good drink selection
I only went once on a Sunday nightand it was very pleasant It felt warm inside which was great since it was a cold February night Good beer good atmosphere good music friendly bartender and decent crowd I would definitely return Especially if I could meet with the same local lad who was a gem to speak with
Very nice pub multiple cozy rooms and lots of places to sit down Interior looked great with lots of decoration Definitely check out the mens bathroom 1 You can also buy cigars here
It has a huge seating area outside aswell as a smaller cozy seating area inside If you decide to sit outside you have to go inside to order They have quite a good selection of drinks nonalcoholic There is also a very large bike rack outside so you wont have to worry about it if youre biking there
Really interesting concept almost like you are in park rather then bar prices are awesome There wasnt any music we could hear or waiters  but still we didnt mind at all Its great place for larger groups since their tables are huge 812 people could sit
One of the most atmospheric bars in Zagreb All the furniture is old and broken the toilet isnt great no food But none of it matters Great place to spend an afternoon drinking in the summer Friendly staff and patrons
Krivi put is a right way to spend your day with friends Good vibes chill atmosphere relaxed people thats what you can find here Like a hidden oasis in downtown of Zagreb  Outdoor terrace is big and open They have a wide variety of drinks a lot of locals like Velebitsko and I noticed especially they drink Velebitsko nefiltrirano which is one of the most popular here During the day a lot of students come here to study in the evening it change face and turns into a night pub Where you have students as your main clients you know prices are lower then in other places I also like they still preserved old look like in old  Some things shouldnt be changed and Krivi put is definitely one of those
Waiter refused let us combine tables since there was 10 of us celebrating a birthday Looked annoyed when we ordered and missed out on second and third round of drinks which we wanted to spend there but since we felt not very welcomed the the 10 of us went on our marry way somewhere else for a drink Also that morning they informed us that there are no resevations  
A bit hidden from the busy urban rhythm which is sometimes a great advantage Lots of air sliding huge glass windows turn it almost into an open space ok beer selection at least the ones we tried I think some amber was one of them good venue for pub quizes Havent tried any food so I cannot tell anything about that
Great beer choice and music Mt friends and I were sitting in the non smoking area if you sit at the smoking area be aware that the smell of cigarette is very strong Nevertheless we will for sure visit again for some lovely drinks 
A nice pub to have coffie andor local or homemade beer to enjoy in a roustic atmosphere
One of my favourite pubs in Zagreb The staff are great and there are some pool tables downstairs Beer selection is pretty unique for Zagreb too  Guinness and Killkenny on tap
Best Irish coffee Ive ever had Lots of care went into making this drink and thats why I love to try new places The bartender was very friendly Thanks
Great place for morning coffe and beer at night You can even play on three billiar tables that are on 1 floor The staff is mostly friendly they have few guys that can be grummpy in the morning but I dont take it perssonaly  In the evenings sometimes they have some special nights like quiz night St Patric celebration watching football matches The place is nicely decorated mostly in wood with comfortable armchairs on the floor 1 The toilet is also nice and clean at least the one for ladies The beers that they serve all craft beers and that is I think the only minus in my opinion since i preffier lager  But Im switching easily to gintonic 
Great beer amazing atmosphere pleasant staff Will definitely come back again Beer prices are a bit spicy
Excellent food Spare ribs were delicious not dry quite a big portion perhaps for 2 and they came easily off the bone Portions are relatively big place is cozy and comfortable and ALL workers were very friendly and helpful We found this place by chance since it was raining hard turned out great Definitely recommend
Stopped in here for a late lunchsnack The menu is very extensive and is peppered with amusing nuggets of information about beer  Sitting outside gives you the chance to watch people going by on the busy pedestrianised street Service was good and friendly Would recommend a visit
We waited 40 minutes for the order to arrive the waitress recommended multiple times to have some fries without telling us the price and after we checked that regular fries cost 340 in less than 2 minutes we asked her if we could change the fries with pub potatoes instead and the answer was absolutely no without even thinking or asking if it was possible They already made the fries in less than 2 minutes and they couldnt change I saw they would bring the food to other tables that ordered after us in less time than they served us but it wasnt possible to change the fries Im sure the fries werent even ready when we asked to change We asked for ketchup and the waitress said ketchup mayonesse So we said ok and she brought us ketchup and mayo in small bags and charged them 140 or 150 i dont remember exactly EACH This is the first time except from fast foods that they charge us for ketchup and mayo In the end when we asked for the bill we paid in cash and we waited more than 10 minutes for the change and when we asked the waitress for it she said she thought it was a tip No we never told her to keep the change or anything but of course she wanted to keep it Unbelievable unprofessional behaviour We always leave tips when we visit other places but this time Im sorry to say that was the worst service we ever had we werent satisfied with how she treated us as guests We saw other waiters there running all the time but unfortunately we werent satisfied at all with the one that served us Overall burgers were good chicken burger had too much paprika in the minced meat
Nice generous serving of fried calamari and chips at a reasonable price 1150 Took a bit of time to get a waiters attention to order and then pay though but nice buzzing atmosphere
Good beer good prices Nice and chill atmosphere with some seating outside If you want a beer on your own or hang with a group of people I think its perfect The bartender was super nice too
Just off the main square and down an alley but could be a whole world away from Zagreb  Perfect place to enjoy a beer on a Sunday
Smoking inside is always a shock but the service and place is great In an interior courtyard
A cool pub in center of Zagreb A bit boring if you want a lively environment Come and have a pint to relax but not to party hard Toilet is as usual bad Music is like some radio its bad Interior is good and cool to look at Overall its a nice pub to come and have a pint Cheers like if you think this is useful
Grumpy waiter wont be ordering from this place again No menu for drink or bites available which is weird Prices were ok
A lovely bar situated on a street and when its not raining or the winter months it makes for a lovely cheeky drink of Karlovako and people watching  The design of the whole place has a really cool vibe too the graffiti artwork is brilliant
If youre mindful poliically this bar makes zero sense unless youre mindless consumer Also it smells awful in the basement i mean bar
Beautifly decorated the walls are painted and pretty The server is nice and we got drinks quickly
Just loved the atmosphere in this place I wanted to take one of the stuffed monkeys home  The cocktails were quite good and refreshing My only complaint is one of the cocktails was almost warm rather than strainedshaken with ice but it was still a tasty beverage This visit was also our first time trying the Croatian PiPi which was like a lesssweet Fanta  Lovely service
Im in love with this place Service is fast and they are available all the time stuff is super kind cocktails are fantastic atmosphere i cozy and chill I could literally live there This is the place to be
The atmosphere is very nice especially during weekend nights It has 3 floors actually as open air place We tried different coctails and they were pretty good with that price so totally recommended if you are looking for a nightout place in Zagreb
Why not Right on the main road in Zagreb city back in an ally theres an hostel with all in Pool restaurant and a great hang out bar in a staged garden Make the the dish washer a bit cleaner and the staff more engadged then this place is a rocket star on the list of places you want to hang out on
The best place in all of Sesvete Great beer great staff great owner great food We even got married here We love everything about this place I recommend to anyone
A very comfortable place to sit and eat something they have homemade beer that is great Burgers are great as well as reasonable prices
Authentic Irish Pub with broad drink selection and delicious food Small and cozy place but probably the best in the city
Best burger in Zagreb I recommend the American burger one And the their dark sweet craft beer is amazing
Nice and cosy little underground pub in the center craft beer on tap great prices gemit for 10 kn board game styled tables Staff is very friendly Theres a guitar that you can use on special occasions 
Very good draft beer nice atmosphere and friendly staff
This punk music spirit craft beer pub opened September 15th in the space of former cult Zagreb blues  rock bar Titu Thats a pretty hard act to follow and its been impressive to see PUNKS get off to a successful running start  The music  live gigs are great and the atmosphere is more reminiscent of a place which has been open much longer  The great rotating selection of local tap craft brews is excellent and highly welcome in this part of the neighborhood Relatively low priced drinks in general and a very competitively priced Trs Graevina based gemit  Im very much looking forward to watch PUNKS bloom into the Upper Town gem its well on its way to becoming  Grab yourself a pale ale or gemit open a tin of varci and enjoy
Really good selection and decent prices Definetly recommend
A nice pub  caffe to grab a cup of coffee or a drink in the center of the city There is also plenty of seating room on the terrace you should defintely take advantage of if the weather is nice The interior is really well decorated as well has a vintage feel to it The serivce is quick but the server was not particulary friendly The cost of a cup of cappucino was which was average at best was 230  Really too much for what they have to offer
We sit here for a short time  girls had some wine Dont take plavac lipanovic That wine felt like opened for days  Waitress men been bit rude  Lady ordered good red wine   but we had to leave it on table  Have to warn others
An elite club where celebrities politicians and  rich  aswell as beautiful people meet Very expensive
The beer was great the club sandwich also but I will never order Caesar salad again in a Pub Just the green salad leaves and some chicken with a little of nuts and cheese 
Best bar in Rijeka Possibly even the best bard in Europe maybe even the world I came for a drink once and met friends for life Nina is the best bartender and c4 is the best beer Ive ever tried And Ive been around many countries and many places but none can beat Croatia and the Bard 1510
A beer lovers place One should come here to taste a palette of flavours depending on which beer you have choosen The square it is located at is quite and a place to hide from the heat  Super friendly waiters
Great atmosphere and cheap beer We didnt order any food but we hope to correct this in the future The right place to have one with your friends
Good beer and good placegood choise And you can also enjoy a GREAT hamburger from Dr Burger 50 mt before the pub
The work hours are not correct and the place closes at two and the top floor does not have adequate ventilation to get all the smoke out Otherwise quite a nice place to grab a drink
Wow  Top place  I love them 
Rude staff Went for a beer in the afternoon and they turned the lights off while we were drinking our beer The hours on the door listed open until midnight Not sure why they were closing up at 5pm when we were the only people in there
Super place Not so much crowded at the day Night time used to be excellent Good  music
The only place in Rijeka that wasnt playing turbofolk until now Total dissappointment
The owner of the apartment where we stayed in was the most pleasant kind n helpful person
Okish very crowded and full of smoke but the only place we found in Rijeka for dancing
Were there before Corona and now after Corona Not as much action than before when we visited they had no croatian draft Beer only Heineken and its a little bit more expensive than in other Bars in Rijeka But the wooden Bar inside is very nice decorated and its clean The Waiter looked not so motivated I Sadly have to say its not the same anymore 
Cool kinda hidden place I didnt know existed even though I live here Affordable prices kind owner amazing interior Definitely recommended Theyre also currently looking for students to work there
Great music and ambience Friendly staff Will come back
Nice
Low key one of the best places in town Place looks great on the inside and has a pool table Doesnt get crowded often and is extremely cozy Amazing place for beer with friends
Great Irish pub just off the Riva Super friendly staff good Guinness and great selection of local craft beers Try the Nova Runda 
Fantastic welcome but was closed at a time when Google said it was open But that is Googles fault The people in this Irish pub are fantastic Service atmosphere a place to meet people from all over the world and share the craic with folk
Okay I rated the food as 4 stars only because its pub grub Are every bite of it  Just absolutely loved the atmosphere because of the clientele We chatted with our bartender Christina and she was awesome  chatting with us about the history of the pub and the local area even recommending local places to eat and drink later and kept us occupied until the locals showed up And they included us into conversations and we feel right at home  A very enjoyable 23 hours here and will definitely come back
Busy bar with great music and good atmosphere Would suggest heading upstairs to get a table Nice selection of beers and spirits Bar staff are friendly and fast at serving
Went there for the Irelandnew Zealand quarterfinal world cup Standing room only The place was packed with fans of both nations and people trying to watch from outside Brilliant atmosphere Drinks were good service good Cash only
Amazing pub excellent atmosphere great selection of beer super friendly staff Miguel is absolutely the best
We thoroughly enjoyed our visits to OHaras pub throughout our holiday at Split The owner was very welcoming  friendly and obliging He turned on the Tour De France for us on request without any hesitation Good music was playing in the background at all times before leaving he gave us an unexpected drink on the house  Definitely worth a visit 
One day I was passing by Just by pure chance I went in and it changed my life My favorite place now Good beer good crowd Met many interesting people there
Nice bar with good decor and a local IPA on draught which was tasty  It has a bit of an Irish theme Jameson and Guinness signs etc going on but I didnt get any sense that its owned run out particularly frequented by Irish people  Worth a visit if youre in the area
Beautifully decorated pub with good selection of drinks Located close to city centre 10 min walking distance Very friendly and fast service
Awful place The decoration is nice but the music was to die for a Saturday night Terrible service with not kind employees Since people are allowed to smoke inside you cant breathe normally and after 15 minutes you get stinky clothes and hair Run from this place Reviews dont match reality
Real cozy pub with a nice staff and some tasty croatian craft beer on tap The only down side they let customers smoke inside
They have a counter area where one can grab food and drinks to go  Annoyingly the prices are not listed and some items are not labeled so one has to ask for the prices individually and for explanation of what certain items are  At the time of writing this review one slice of pizza was 3 sandwiches were 5 and wraps were 7  I waited in line for about 1 minute and when my turn came one of the employees went inside and the other one started cleaning up After about one or two minutes she looked up and was like oh can I help you It was a bit confusing because my thoughts were that she is busy with cleaning and cant serve me do I have to wait for the other one but it seems she just wasnt attentive  I took a tuna wrap and it was OK
For the price 5 star especially across from cruise ships I am guessing that when busy service is bad Not busy today Burger great the balkan style cevapcici with ivar sauce fantastic
Great place for a quick bite midway between Split old town and the Ferry and Bus Terminal Great service with a smile reasonable prices and an extensive enough menu
Cool little spot however the service was terrible I had to go ask if they were open after sitting for quite some time Again I had to find what I suspect to be the owner or owners son to pay He never came back to the table to check on us The glass I was given for my beer was filthy I wouldnt waste my time here again when there are so many great places with excellent service in Split
We were welcomed as a gay couple  and enjoyed the staff taking care of us At night we were told is better for being with our gay people During the day the tourists came for a drink and it was good happy atmosphere
A brilliant bar for any traveller Ideal for solo adventurers Well priced drinks amazing atmosphere great events on including live music A hotspot for international travellers to mingle and share stories
Circus was phenomenal She helps my girls find everything we needed on the spot Was so sweet the best introduction to our time in split
Great place Really friendly staff Amazing frizen margaritas
we have been eating here for a few years now and it is one of our favourites very tasty and large portions everything is served with a smile top staff working here price here is slightly higher than other restaurants but it is well worth it we keep coming back here
Whod know a barclub would make such good food None of us needed even an ounce of salt or pepper Everything was super good and service was good You should try the restaurant during the day and then come back for drinks during night
Nice stylish place with great food and polite staff We had beef spreads for a starter  sorry they were gone before I even made photos  grilled chicken with homemade potato chips and pasticada a traditional Dalmatian slowcooked meat dish with gnocchi Everything tasted great and I would definitely come back
Great atmosphere really good music Cash only bar where the bar tenders seem to make up the prices I paid 25 and then 35 for the same round if of drinks Extremely crowded near the dance floor but if you head to the back of the bar there is plenty of space We went back twice in 2 nights
Affordable cocktails decent selection of beers relaxing atmosphere very likeable waiter air conditioning  all you need on a hot summer afternoon Maybe not important information but might be to some  one of the cleanest and best equipped bar restrooms Ive ever encountered in Croatia  The only downside is that smoking is allowed at this place and if the terrace is closed youre doomed to smoke filled interior
Good atmosphere But the waitress was with a very unhappy face and unfriendly I hope this doesnt always happen here Visit 07072024
Great place for drink with friends Less than 10 minutes from center of Split
This is my go to pub I love it Atmosphere is green and beautiful a lot of nice pictures Great service when they give you peanuts Im not sure why they dont give me peanuts sometimes but its okay I understand All in all worth your visit
Cheap Cash only you can get 2 beers pints for under 5 The long island ice tea is savage
Guy flagged us down for a drink as we were walking by and sat us at a table outside After ordering several rounds and wracking up a bill we tried to pay at which point he then told us its cash only and pointed to a tiny little sign inside the bar that said so Anywhere else weve gone where this was the case they clearly disclosed it ahead of time
Avoid Staff served us while conveniently not indicating its the only cash bar in the old town When asked they said they couldnt tell us its a cash only bar while we sat outside what then pointed to a tiny sign inside If you want your business to benefit from tourism then get with the times
Great cocktails and low prices Rather quiet and komfortable to take a break
Super cheap very busy and swift service from a young lass who really knows hot to run her bar no matter how busy it gets  Thanks for the Vodkas 
Excellent beers and coffee The great selection of jazz and blues tunes really elevated the vibe 
Nice place nice music nice locals nice staff nice drinks
Great place for local people Better ventilation would be appreciated cigarette smoke on gallery makes you feel like smoked prosciutto
The drinks at this bar were amazing We also loved the way the menu described the drinks was super easy to choose what we liked We got the spicy drink  the tropical thunder They are both tequila based and so so good The vibe was great as well  they were playing throwback 2000s music and it was perfect The staff were also really friendly
The pub had a vibrant and energetic atmosphere that made for a memorable evening The staff were friendly and attentive ensuring that we had everything we needed The selection of drinks was impressive with a decent range of craft beers and cocktails to choose from The pub also offered delicious bar snacks that perfectly complemented our drinks  specially the pulled pork bao buns
Nice cocktail bar I wouldnt advice coming here for dinner as it is mainly snacks to accompany drinks which we didnt realise We still had a nice time with nice drinks and a good atmosphere
Impeccable service Awesome bar with original as hell cocktails and delicious side order food options Seriously try the cocktailsmindblowingly good Great music too
A lovely drink in a busy hip street We had some cocktails recommend it for an after hour fun
I always go there for breakfast Just love the croissant with scrambled eggs and cheese Delicious It is not cheap but good quality The croissant and fresh orange juice will cost you around 10 The waitress are very friendly and it is a place with local costumers The area to sit outside is great and though I have been there in the summer there are some fireplaces for colder days For sure it is a great place to have a cocktail in the evening
Delicious breakfast in this place The food is super good and fresh The atmosphere and decorations are also very very beautiful The staff are friendly and very efficient Highly recommended
Teo ist the best waiter but ivana is much better then him bc she has a nice eyeliner Tjey are all really nice and sympathic and i hope they get a raice We made new friends bcecause they are so nice Teo is reallzy cool
It was okay We were ignored by the staff at first and waited for about 10 mins One thing that did piss me off was the fact that we couldnt split our bill at the end We werent told that we had to say that we were going to pay separately until we asked for the bills plural Please let the costumers know about this sort of thing  I really did dislike the fact that they were writing the orders in a phonelikethingy Made us uncomfortable  The food was fine a bit overpriced but that was expected considering the location The water was 5 though and that really was overly expensive
Waitress was mocking not helpfull or service minded at all coffee was foul image large coffee with cream and a fly for good meassure drinks were expensive and mediocre food supposedly good but same dishes differed a lot in size Dont come here
Very small portions we went for a slice of pizza after eating there lol service was good though nice view nice atmosphere The beef and burrata salada is not beef its a type of salami
The food was good It was nothing special but not bad either The staff was really friendly and supportive when it started to rain Youre not doing anything wrong when choosing this restaurant
We had a brilliant time in here for our last night in Split The service was really great and the food even better It wasnt too badly priced slightly more than youd normally pay but it was worth it for the quality of the food and the attentiveness of the waiters and waitresses The presentation was exceptional too Thank you very much and I recommend this place to anyone fancying some fresh local produce cooked in a delightful manner
We had breakfast  food was tasty portions were pretty small for the price we paid Good location nice view Each table had a button which we were supposed to press when we were ready to order etc which I thought was a great idea as I like to order in my own time however we have been approached by waiters twice within the first 5 minutes after we sat down so the button option was pointless Overall would recommend 
Beautiful setting outdoors on the water The juices were fresh The food delicious The service was very nice Overall recommend
Cosy place to brunch with view on the sea and on the boats  Lots of choices to eat we went for the french toast and the breakfast nr 7  Very friendly staff we got a nice spot to sit with our 5m old daughter with her stroller
This place had a brilliant atmosphere right in the center of Diocletians Palace in Split We went there for three evenings during our sixday visit and had food on two of those evenings enjoying some relaxing drinks on our final evening Unfortunately I didnt get the name of one of the staff members who served us every night but he was absolutely topnotch There was music playing outside every evening which added to the great ambiance and the place was buzzing with energy I highly recommend it
Wow The food was great the service was wonderful  we had the best waiter Mario who was patient  nice and explained and recommended on good dishes And he was so great with our kids my daughter fall in love with him And the live music was great Best place in our trip in Croatia
There are very few places in Split where one can get a beer without having to order food as well Lvxor is my favorite has great air conditioning a very cool decor cold beer and a superfriendly staff If you just want to get out of the heat and have a beerdrink without having to order food this is the place Located across the courtyard from the tower in Diocletians Palace
Best pasta with beef and truffles  Nice sitting inside where you can talk as well as listening to the live musician singing soft romantic songs Visitors sitting around the square listening to the soft music and dancing  A beautiful evening to spent with family friends and love ones 
Great cafe great selection of drinks especially beer The location is extraordinary the atmosphere and ambience excellent Staff polite and helpful
Really nice place wit big assortment of beers and spirits I feel very at home there
Staff was trash he judged us for ordering pizza with less cheese
Some beers on tap stale Service ok but not perfect Not very inclusive
Great choice of beer and friendly and helpful staff This location otherwise quite dull was in need of a bar like this Recommended 
Highlight of my visit was when my cousin brought a Hemp Ale you guys had to try Delicious 
Love the Croatia brewed beer So happy to find this place close to the station
Good music nice people and excellent beer
Ok
just beautiful
super
Good caffe
Fabulous place indeed Very kind staff
Terrible experience from the start Waitress had a hard time with the menu and when we finally received our bottle of wine it was painful to watch her try to open it Eventuallyshe asked us to open it for her To continue the bottle was not chilled and she left without pouring us a glass and she forgot to acknowledge other guests at the table Latter in the evening she came to the table to look at the label of the bottle and left which we thought its odd but we didnt think much about it However when we got our bill the bottle of wine was double the price she told us I went to inquire and was told we received the wrong bottle I believe if I didnt speak the language I would be overcharged They fixed the price but I felt embarrassed bringing my Canadian and Spanish friends here Great location but I would not recommend this place
Nice view on the river but the service was too slow Maybe they need more bartenders The staff that was there was very friendly tho For craft beer lovers there isnt much to choose from really Could be better
The view is beautiful its on a corner so it gets windy outside  The menu consists of a few non alcoholic drinks such as juices and a bunch of alcoholic ones from shots to wine to cocktails  The downside is you have to wait quite a long time to get serviced and dome of the waiters are giving off attitude quite a lot  There are exceptions of course
Great coffee great atmosphere and great service
Ok
Good atmosfere prohibited eating inside

It smells like fish
Super

Not bad
Suppp
Nicely decorated with fish aquariums a hidden gem Terrace availabile in summer months
Nice atmosphere curtious staff lovely fishes 
Ok
The waiter was a little bit confused
The interior is elegant with a touch of nature Feeling like im drinking coffee in the wilderness The coffee is so bitter adding too much sugar sont fix it Also the music is outrageous
20 meters from childrens playground You can drink your coffee Im peace
Ok
the waitress was very unapproachable and rude when I ordered a glass of water she said that they dont do that and that I have to order something else she brought the wrong order and when we asked her to bring us what we ordered the order was practically threw it on the table and behaved very rudely towards the guests

Great place Great music Great selections of drinks
Very nice service
Nice and cosy waitress is excellent in her job One of my favourite places when Im in Osijek
Nice caffe with not to loud music and discrete lightning my recommendations
Ok
The best of all is the terrace a great choice for indoor parties
Good space and different selection of music they could work on the toilets since the content is quite minimal Helpful staff and no waiting in line
A little more finishing and the perfect place to go out


Lovely place for drinks with a top location in Zadar We enjoyed our time both outside and inside the bar there is plenty of beer cocktails We recommend drinking Maraschino kiss
Nice pub for hanging around in the evening hours Service drinks and Ambiente are nearly perfect matches
Had great service at first Good beer music and not too smokey inside When we had finished drinks took glasses back and asked for another Was told to sit down  hed be over After 10 minutes  several newcomers served still not come We got exact cash together  left it with him Too many customers  cocktail orders for 1 man to serve GET MORE STAFF
I had a great time there The staff are really nice and very kind The price is very reasonable for the quality of the beer and the ambiance
A group of me and my friends visited Zadar for 4 days from the UK We found Frenky Bar on the first night and spent every other night we had here The drinks are so affordable but the atmosphere is incredible We met so many people from all over the world The bartender was amazing We drank through the menu pretty quickly and he was more than happy to make anything we asked for and lots of surprise drinks and shots He was so welcoming and lovely If you are in Zadar I actually cannot recommend this place enough The music the atmosphere the staff the drinks This is the best bar I have ever visited we are coming back to Zadar purely for this place Thank you
Im here right now Im not leaving till it closes Its amazing  cheap tasty good music Im so happy we dont have a bar like this back in my country because I would sit there all night every night
BEST BAR EVER 2 euro a drink and rave and dance tunes playing all night 2 geordies from Newcastle and the best vibe in all of Zadar The guy who owns it is in his late 70s LEGEND 
I fell in love with this bar mostly for its drinks sx on the old washmachine was the best The owner is also very nice and friendly guy and rest of the personal was also very nice If i ever go back in Zadar i will knock myself out drunk like yesterday
Perfect place with astonishing view on the old city delicious coffee experienced waiter with excellent manners 3 stars of 5 only because more than sometimes there is only one waiter who rushes and cant cover terrace all alone so this one goes on the owners back
Nice Location for drinking not overcrowded not to expensive tasty home made Icetea
Affordable price for beers We spent a few hours watching the boats and basking in the sun Definitely worth a visit for a drink or two had a Long Island iced tea and was one of the best Ive had Would love to visit again in future
Update your hours matey Thanks
Came here last night cocktails were well priced and super tasty But by far the best part was the staff So friendly and lovely really made us feel welcome 
Amazing cocktails So fudging cheap The best Cool people Cool vibes The counter culture center of the city Friendly neighborhood cat
This place has a soul Reminds me of the micro bars in the northern Europe Chill vibes Excellent choice of music Affordable prices Would recommend to everyone whos a bit fed up with tacky tourist places in Croatia This place is a breath of fresh air and Croatia needs more places like this
Awesome drinks great service
One of the best bars in Zadar Great service tasty coffee and delicious cocktails Highly recommended
Horrible drinks and even worse service Also worth mentioning the owner seems to comment all one star reviews by accusing people to steal drinks Terrible place
Waited for a long time for the waiter to come take our order When our drinks arrived they had put at least 10 ice cubes in my 60ml drink without even asking me if i wanted ice in the first place Also very expensive compared to other places in the area
Best Place in Zadar for drink and peopleBarman Rocco Is the best
A very nice place to chill and have a drink The service was very good and timely as well
Ok
Super
Waiting for hours only small beers 3 minimum pizza ok but the overall impression is bad
I recommend the daily menu as Its an affordable lunch option in the old town area Nice atmosphere and a solid service
Great cafe tucked away in one of the many lane ways of the old town  A great place for a coffee  one of the best for me in Zadar  There is an atrium style seating area opposite the original building where it seats almost 6080p Outdoor seating as well A popular spot for young adults due to the bar however also a go to for the locals 
Thats a shame  I ordered a Pornstarn Martini and there was non of alcohol in it  Also a size was just ridiculous Definitely I do not recommend
Weve love it Nice and beautiful place to have a drink  Hvala 
Nice budget place for darts and drinking Outdoor area available but on the main street Mainly local guests
Nice location good staff small selection of beer
The cafe has not been open for months 
Unfortunately it doesnt work anymore
Teh best drink for best price love it
Lovely place  good prices delicious pizza and the service was very nice Would recommend to anyone
Great bar delicious cocktails and great service Would definitely visit again
Liked this place very much Wine and sandwiches were great
Ok place
Okay
Best coffee in town

Great place for spend some time when you come in Zadar Good atmosphere very kind staff and affordable prices I will recommended this bar to everyone 1010 
Guma bar is a really nice place to have a few drinks and hang out with friends Its a must to visit Cheers Guma bar for the fun I had
Good ambience great service and  Mohito so tastyWell done Team 
Ill never go back there Rude and incompetent waiter spilled hot coffee over a customer and the glass broke over her back He carried too much stuff 2 rows of things one over the other on the pladder Moreover he did not appologize and nobody else reacted The owner should know this kind of unproffessiinalism will cost him the bars reputation
Very nice cafe with a big choice of drinks for reasonable prices We loved to start our morning here with a cup of cappuccino
Nice waitress Good prices and delicious Iced Coffee with different tastes ChocolateVanillaCoconut etc
Nice place but the music is very bad and annoying american top 40 they play the same bad songs every 30 minutes Please update your music playlist
The nearby beach is 1110 but the WiFi is private  Also i love kofee
Great craft beer bar in the centre of Zagreb Large selection of draught and bottled beers Super cosy garden area The statues of musicians are a special bonus
very nice beer garden with huge variety of croatian beers highly recommend for those who tasted Karlovako and didnt like it dont give up on croatian beer they also have a lot of international ones and different types for those who want to explore beers in general  hibiscus sour was my favorite  the staff was amazing friendly and helpful  made the whole experience even better  overall a must visit 
Our cabbie recommended this place we went during the day for a few drinks Prices were far too cheap for cocktails I was very suspicious and rightly so
Fantastic place with busts and sculptures of famous rock stars through the years outside in the garden Really friendly staff and good selection of drinks too This was part of a fleeting visit to Zagreb but we found hidden gems like this dotted aroind the city so will return
Fun atmosphere resembling that of a club but still not over the top loud either Amazing place to chill out with either yourself or your friends  The service here was absolutely amazing with very nice servers and bartenders The main bartender we saw there obviously knew and took pride in his craft  Our servers have been exceptional at guiding us and creating cocktails made personally
The place is really interesting and very well decorated in steam punk style There were a lot of people but we got our drinks very fast The staff is great friendly and they work fast We had coctails and the price was acceptable not too much like most places We saw some interesting things on the menu so we will come back to try more
I had a coffee americano here Everything was ordinary nice spot to have a drink However it is allowed to smoke inside and it is really unpleasant for me
Fav place in Zagreb Cozy place with great atmposhere
Big terrace cozy inside big clean restroom
Menu is very limited just basic drinks
Nice warm basement seating especially convenient during wintertime
Delicius white coffe i warm croasant made my morning beautifull

super
Decent prices the only bad thing was the inappropriate throwing of local krkans everything else was good
Good pub nice ambience meeting point of local Krkans 1010
The atmosphere is pleasant the music is top notch Exyu rock when I was there the waiters are polite the range of drinks enchanted me Here your fourlegged pets can also drink their beer while you drink your personalized coffee or drink from a wide selection from nonalcoholic homemade juices to all kinds of alcoholic drinks I am delighted with the offer and quality and approach to guests
Excellent coffee small works of art pleasant atmosphere very nice waiter All praise and recommendations
I have to praise the quality of the coffee its always the same quality all the praise I would only suggest that you include cocoa in the offer because my friend only drinks cocoa Everything else is great keep up the good work Lp Martin
Drinks stand out The staff is very polite I really like Saturday nights when there is live music
Great beer and coffee
Best service good people Nice selection of music and lovely atmosphere overall
Great selection of beer and beverage cozy and comfy atmosphere
Nice terrace but a lot of traffic and car noise
What an epic venue the atmosphere in here is buzzing it never gets dull Bar is mega busy but hey thats all a part of it
Really cozy bar  cozy music good service and good prices 1 draft beer 18 kuna and lots of different options Hidden gem A bit far away from center but worth a walk Smoking inside is aloud  be aware of this
Although great venue for good beer and music concert area is poorly ventilated Good beer chive nice and big outside sitting area
A very good place to finish the evening very nice ambiance We didnt sample the food but the service was average and slow maybe because it was at the end of the night
Very slow and unprofessional staff we waited for more than 15 minutes for a waitress to come at the end had to go to the bar to order coffee and the waitress said that she is not sure that she will have time to make coffee We definitely wont come here again
Do not expect the drink you ordered as you will receive something completely different Especially when it comes to coffee
Great cafe Nondairy milk available Excellent service and great latte Love the vibes
It has a huge smoking and nonsmoking area It is located inside the shopping center so use the toilet that is in the center Prices are affordable Very nice location of the city
Very nice place interesting design Nice atmosphere The stuff is very kind professional and helpful Affordable prices Highly recommending the place
A very cute and cozy place in Novi Zagreb great prices and tasty coffe
Awesome atmosphere great staff and superb pricing everything you could wish for in a bar its overall one of if not the best bar in New Zagreb
Undescribebly calm atmosfere good drinks not too crovded even on weekends and not too expensive Good place for work but also an recreation The employers are nice and friendly and interior is all retro 80s if you love that kind  of stuff this is bar for you
Awesome place for lunch The food was delicious the staff was really great the location is excellent If youre in Pula please visit Old City Bar  you wont be disappointed
Food is excellent  staff are super friendly and the atmosphere is great  and Spezial orders are no problem  we tried nearly the whole Men between all of us and we recommend it all
The atmosphere and customer service is what brings us back over and over again and the prices are good  The Old City bar establishment is Top in the city Its the place to go for the old city ambiance your surrounded by history and a wonderful place for the weekend night out Definitely its a mustsee and do
Enjoyed the food here so much on my first night that I came back on the final lunch before flying home  Both times had the mixed meat platter which was great value at 13  It came with 5 types of meat mixed vegetables red onion and ajvar  It doesnt come with any bread or potatoes but those can be purchased as side dishes  Good service  Quick and friendly  Credit cards are accepted
Most unique bar in Pula If you are heading out to get dinner drinks in a vibing place go here Live DJ frequents here as well Downside was that I got a warm beer 
Its hidden away and I didnt expect much but as soon as you enter the vibes are absolutely amazing both in the outside area and the inside area have a great atmosphere The staff at the bar was a bit slow with the drinks but they tasted good
We had burgers and craft beer They have many different craft beers Burgers were delicious served with patatoes Price is reasonable Music was good
Tasty afordable burger menus I recommend taking Truffle Fries
Great little bar We just had a couple of drinks taking in the 1920s vibe of James Joyce Not expensive Bar staff helpful
We came here to have a cocktail due to the good reviews The cocktails are overpriced for the quality quite watery lack of main components no Rhum in a Mai Tai Go somewhere else
Ordered a wine it came in a filthy cup with a small bug in it Asked the waitress for another cup she returned with the same filthy cup minus the bug Would not recommend
Mai Tai with no Rum Amaretto and iceNegroni with no Gin Watered down vermouth and ice yes literallynot just short on the measure  Avoid at all cost if you like your cocktails
Good strong coffee friendly service and great historical building
Unprofessional service waited for my macchiato almost an hour while the owner yelled at people outside for no reason When he was finished with yelling he went inside and started drinking while on work He said it helps with his liver problems Horrible experience stay away
For an order 32 Kn  barmen took 40 and didnt give change Disappointing experience
Good and strong cappuccino but limited offering of beverages not the same as advertised on the menu
Best place in town the owner is so friendly you wont be able to get away without some amazing local advice or shots Clean toilets and comfy seats in the terras
Great local bar in Center of Pula Place For punkrockers alternativa reggae and similar fans More than solid coffee and few different branda of istrian craft beer brands
Local barpub nice atmosphere 
Cool place with great coffee in the city center The waiters and waitresses were commited to great service and were very friendly
Bad Cocktails and unpolite waitress The good Reviews seems to bei Fake I would Not recommend this place
Love it and only kids from 20082010 would know the Daltons cartoon
Nice local bar with friendly staff reasonably priced drinks
Has a pool table 
Local place Beer is cheap enough Couple of tables outside Friendly service
Ok
Super
Super
They were not in the bar but they lived in a neighboring house and every evening they listened to the lively conversations of local men The atmosphere was to their liking and the cheerful hubbub did not stop until the knowledge
Excellent bar excellent waitresses and safe to be commended excellent prices Good location close to the ring road Parking A pleasant place for a quiet pizza A local place with lots of famous people I recommend it
Friendly staff Nice place good service I recommend
The owner and staff were very helpful and I felt comfortable
The perfekt place good cocktails fair prices Love it 
A nice little beach bar by the Lukobran beach in Pjescana Uvala You can order drinks eat food and also rent chair for laying on the beach Really enjoyed their service
Great place for watching sunset Best sangria in this area and super cheap 1 liter is 75 kn which is equivalent to one cocktail in the city on average The beach is not dog friendly
Great vibes drinks sunset views and music
Great food with a pleasant atmosfere and friendly staff
The place has different owner now They changed menu too More local meat food It is pity that they havent some fish in menu Or such good beers as before But the staff is very very kind And the atmosphere with the olive trees is magic
The first picture was taken 2 years ago The 2 and 3 picture was taken today Then you got 5 burgers instead of 3 for same price78kn with a big slice of baconand you got a delicius potatoes Now you get a smaller and less good bread with less baconalmost none less ingredients and the french fries were cheapest frozen and terrible It was a big disappointment for today
Weve read about this place as being one of the top dining experiences Faana has to offer and being somewhat of burger enthusiasts we were eager to pay them a visit or maybe even a few during our stay However the experience was underwhelming The place itself is a few minutes walk from the bustling town center so it already has a nice calm vibe Adding to that is that it has beautiful outside seating in a lovely unpretentious Mediterranean backyard with plenty of space between tables The background music playing was 80s Top 40 All these things show they do care about creating an ambiance but lets also see about food right They have a reasonably expansive drinks selection with an accent on naturally craft beers both local and international The burgers come in variety of Black Angus local beef and bokarin patties along with the regular accomplices of fries onion rings mozzarella sticks etc and if your date isnt into food all that much theres salads Unfortunately one of our party has a diet restriction and is not allowed to have any dairy or soy in their food We talked to the waitress she was knowledgeable about which meals were made with these ingredients and helpfully suggested a burger with lettuce instead of the bun seeing the buns were made with milk Having our order sorted with the helpful waitress we were pretty excited about the food as it was a long day and were really hungry Though the place has only about a dozen tables we waited for more than an hour to get our food And on the specially ordered nondairy burger  a big slice of cheese proudly melting on the patty Of course we complained they apologized but then again we had to wait for another 20 minutes to get the burger with no lettuce buns and practically no sides We had our food it tasted nice but we were just not in the mood any more to enjoy it The dairy incident aside it was a mistake it can happen to everyone we do not really hold it against the establishment it still leaves the issue of very slow service It seemed that the place was understaffed and the long wait times were really diminishing the experience Overall this place does have great food the atmosphere is wonderful and if they find a way to speed up the service Id be more than happy to upgrade the number of stars
I visit this place a lot and Mr Dominik always makes The most finger lickin lip smakin mouth waterin coctails so good make you wanna smack your mamma ribs
we had a piece of aluminium foil in our 20 drink I dont have to say anything else 
Great drinks and excellent coffee in amazing mugs  Great staff and boss they know why 
Nice place but worst cocktails I ever tried
Wonderful place top coffee great service Karlovac was missing a place like this
Super waiter and great atmosphere You get a biscuit with the coffee and the waiter knows how to spin rounds Top cafe
A very nice cafe the waiter is very polite smiling and pleasant
A pleasant bar with friendly staff right on the banks of the Kupa in the city center
Excelent food quality and prices are very reasonable highly recommending Best time to visit is around noon not sure if all day same food avaliable as place is primary oriented to lunch brake for local customers Unfortunately Sundays kitchen is closed but only coffy bar is open
This is a nice restaurant for fast lunch The food quolity is good The portions are really big It is good to share them The ambient is not so nice Service is slow but acceptable Location is out of town but there is enough parking space
Perfect place in an old part of town hidden behind Diocletian palace walls Pizza is very tasty
Nice coffee
Best Irish pub in Sofia despite the strange access Guinness  Kilkenny on tap a large selection of bottled beers Live music on weekly basis
We spend about 1 hour there as a group Nice and cozy place 05 bottle of beer was 5 BGN Its optimal I think If I will come Sofia again I definitely visit this place
A decent Irish pub in the city center at the end of the pedestrian street Entrance is hard to find though you have to walk through a doggylooking door and walk up one floor in a staircase Nonetheless the place is nice
I think this place is excellent for people who love going to pubs Nice people nice sometimes live music nice drinks Could be pretty crowded at times though Not for you if you dont like noisy
The place has a great atmosphere great beer and service The food was kind of okay We came for the fish and chips as we thought it will be authentic It was disappointing as it had bad smell like the fish wasnt fresh Chicken wings were okay
Great place great food and a great atmosphere Also the best pint of Guinness in Bulgaria I will be back soon and highly recommend a visit here 
Great food service and atmosphere Sundays at 4 pm open jam session
FoodTasty burger First time eating veggie burger and it was good and cheaper than the normal burger with 2bgn differences Price Reasonable Because for 2 burger with French fries for each and 2 drinks we paid 5250bgn which is 2625 Friendly staff and clean place Thanks
The perfect place to have few shots after long day or watch football
Great local pub   A lot of character and characters
If youre in the VitoshaBotev vicinity and seeking a cute quiet offpiste bolthole for excellent coffee drinks and service in a unique Frenchbarstyle setting this is a gem of a place that youll return to again and again Open from 8h for early birds
Tasty breakfast good coffee  fast WiFi kind service What else
Very bad Bunch of senior people of Bulgarian football union have been there They have been drunk and loud Very unpleasant Yordan Lechkov Borislav Mihaylov have been dancing on Preslava Looks like more like a private club for the Bulgarian Football Union instead of public place to enjoy a good beer
OK bar friendly staff  Good Guinness  Huge selection of spirits  Definitely an ok bar in Sofia when the little boy who thinks he is the owner is not letting his mates kids use it as a playground with bikes and scooters  The boy needs to wake up stop ignoring customers your mates wont keep you in business A good bar being ruined by an idiot
A really nice bar with unique atmosphere It is made with taste and attention to detail Once the finish the refurbishment it will be truly nice A great choice of whiskeys is just adding to the overall experience When I visited it was not crowded at all but I assume it just need to gain a bit on popularity and a reservation in advance would be required to visit it
A great bar the staff is very friendly and the music is always good Would definitely recommend it One of the bars in Sofia we visit on a regular basis
Very nice place good variety of craft beers good price Only bad thing is that promotion of local beers is not as it should too low Toiled requires more attention but for guy its fine
Hate places like this Take advantage of tourists too embarrassed to say anything about being overcharged Ordered 2 Guinness and when the bill came it was twice the price that was shown above the bar Avoid
Maybe its just a coincidence and the quality is often better but yesterday night I got horrible food poisoning after eating what the waitress described as Bulgarian kebab I was constantly going to the toilet during the night and apart from that I still have not been able to leave my bed its 1330 Beware
Best place for a relaxing cold beer in Sofia
Loved this place Went to watch the RWC final Staff really friendly and welcoming but customers really friendly bunch as well Had a great singer when I was there as well If I lived in Sofia this would be my local pub
Very cozy bar They often have quizz nights Great location and atmosphere Outstanding cocktails
Just behind NDK this bar has amazing and high quality cocktails Loved the Violet vodka and pia colada The staff is friendly and the service is fast even though the place tends to be as busy as it gets The bar itself is small but has few outdoor seating During quiz nights or live music it is harder to find a place
Very happy atmosphere and good music Guinnesss is top quality
Its self service You can sit outside in small groups Great selection of international beer Irish Belgian German and a lot of other drinks too
Great Bar to sink a few beers A good selection of German Lagers Hope to see some more Bulgarian craft beers in the future
Good bar but overcrowded and a good set of foreign beers
Great variety of tap beers and also bottled ones Its small cozy self service and in one of the best areas of the city Would recommend to anyone
Nice sunny spot to have lunch with outdoor seating Not many options for vegetariansvegans but the food is good if youre looking for meet and cheese  English menu seems to not be uptodate tho The beer selection could also be improved Service is fast
Great place for lunch They have a rotating menu Not every day is the same  When we went we got the Greek moussaka which was lovely Creme caramel for dessert was nice too  They offer place to smoke cigs outside and their inside is nice and toasty
Unfortunately the principal is ignorant and rather unfriendly Low command of the English language The food is ok After dinner they did not accept the credit card and made us walk to an ATM to get cash That is in 2023 rather an outdated standard The young lady working there did a good job I wish the whole team all the best and hopefully kindness will lead this place in the near future
Brilliant quiet warm evening in the garden of Kulata Put The staff were very attentive and quick The food was delicious A lovely evening Thank you
Came here because it was on the way back to the apartment were staying at Now probably going to be here every night while were in Sofia The theme and decor clue is in the name has obviously had a lot of thought put into it Atmosphere is lively but not so much that we cant relax Music is great staff are friendly and helpful Oh and theres beer Literally cant think of a bad thing to say
I like the place So clean Have good variety High level of hospitality The interior design and style is so catchy I love it I just rested there for 15mins to grep cup of coffee but i feel they have good
I very rarely review bars but felt inclined to review Despite the biker appearance owner is very welcoming no matter who and will always accommodate Cheap beers and great atmosphere
Excellent people for a great time and good beer Very good price also I recommend getting a cigar next door and enjoy it with fresh beer and company
Great place for lunch  brunch  dinner A big verity of beers  a beer tap on every table that you can use The service is absolutely amazing I really recommend this place
Very cool place There are taps in walls from which you can pour beer crafted in restaurant Menu contains quite simple food ideal for watching football Staff was very kind and proffesional Cant complain about anything
A place where you can pour your own beer which I consider to be super cool The beer was under average though at least to me What I really liked was the food though I loved the chicken wings with their arab bread The staff very nice and patient speaks English Also there is payment by a card possible
Good beer friendly staff and not so crowded when we visited the pubrestaurant a Friday afternoon Recommendes if you like beer
What a top spot to enjoy you coffee or cocktail It seemed like nothing less of an oasis in the city center of Sofia Excellent service by the waiter He was very pleasant and helpful The garden was beautiful clean and high taste Everything had identity which I highly seek for at a bar Bravo Tobacco Bar excellent
Nice place located in a beautiful garden with a lovely ambience The coffee is extremely normal No Americano just very small black coffee
The place is located in a really beautiful garden with a quiet atmosphere The coffee is tasty but the cappuccino was quite cold Other than that it was a nice place
Delightful quiet and romantic bar in a garden Recommend for a date or quiet catchup with friends in a stylish environment
Amazing place  nice person nice music and perfect service For sure Im going to visit again PS The Bar is on the centre of city  There is a subway station near to it
Very nice bar  food drinks 1010  reservation is required to avoid waiting   mostly people there are above 25
Sit outside and enjoy the view with a cocktail and nice service
Nice dog friendly place we had our Annual corgi Christmas party there 
Very rich assortment of beers I was driving and had the best non alcoholic beer ever The food is nice quite happy with the service too  Such a typical pub experience
Great pub in the city centre with a lot of beer choices They have their own live beer which has a really great taste Perfect spot for watching your favourite football match with friends cause there are a lot of televisions around the pub and most of the time there is more than one match going live on them
If you are in Sofia and youd like to watch a football match in a friendly environment this is the perfect place The place is in the very centre of the city You can choose between several brands of beers although the food could be better
Great place Nice vibe Food looks delicious Coming back
Nice dark atmosphere with good funky music and cozy interior There is a nice selection of signature and classical cocktails You can also ask for a bespoke cocktail or let the bartenders surprise you The staff are very friendly and welcoming Please note that this place serves only drinks so if youre hungry its probably not the place for you In addition it is important to note that it is selfservice
Nice place nice atmosphere nice staff basically all good zero complain We went for some drinks and we werent disappointed Thanks to nikolai for the amazing whisky sour 
All the cocktails we got were very tasty I recommend Lilly with the cucumber which was mild but delicious Interior was interesting and staff was friendly Prices are reasonable for authors cocktails  However I must say we visited on Sunday night and the place closed around 1am and not 2am as its said on their working times Probably they stay until 2am only on Fridays and Saturdays but thats a wild guess of mine So keep that in mind when visiting  Anyways keep up the good work
The worst Margarita and service everthe taste was awful and the glass just ridiculous After i returned the full glass of Margarita and i ordered a glass of wineinstead of offering the wine as compensationas it should bethey made me pay it Im never coming back to this bar and i am very disappointed
good place for play some games and have a beer no Windows though
Really nice comfortable spot playing great music and serving good beer at a good price Lots of bottled options Very good pool table and balls and excellent cues for 2 lev Full size snooker available too
Super nice owners and bartenders made me feel right home even though Im just visiting Great open space and a spot where you can just grab a drink at the bar play bar games or just sit back and watch some soccer on one of the many TVs Love this place
Smells like a basement Even though there were max 15 people inside the music was so loud we couldnt hear each other Do not order Bloody Mary  they obviously dont know how to make cocktails Mine was 99 tomato juice
Nice place good menu Greek style promotions  ouzo with Greek salad pizza pasta etc
The most tasty pizza  ever served For sure the sauce was prepared inhouse when the order was received can tell it from the fresh taste Must try are the pizzas there I recommend them
May be one of the best places to go for a quick bite in Students town Very good location with tables in open for a nice weather Inside cosy well furnished Usually very tasty food quick and polite service Just the last time for lunch the steak was hard to chew cold and tough Aside of this I definitely recommend them  in case they have not changed the owner or the cook I prefer to think that last time it was just an exception
Burger tasted terrible but the other food was good and the waitress was quick with the service
This is not a joke Best toilet paper ever I didnt even need the restroom but Ive read a review and had to also say wow For sure the staff was amazing Maggie was awesome The beer was cold and delicious and this was foreal an Irish pub You know its good when the patrons are Irish Im from the statesLatino Watching soccer and hurling Definitely come here for a real Irish pub experience
The smoothest economical dreamiest toilet paper a bar could ever present If you are a connoisseur of toilet experiences this is the place to be  Everyone had the experience of an upset stomach with no proper release around BUT NOT HERE 55  Besides this the tap has a nice futuristic feature Go see for yourself  My first impression aside the long island iced tea was the best we have encountered in Plovdiv so far Prepared by very friendly fun and charismatic bar personnel  PS Dont be like the guy that walked in used the toilet and walked away without a thank you 
Great choice of tap beers and good liquors Nice atmosphere good location  fine the green shamrock 
They relocate recently and even had Kilkenny on tap Good vibes and good  friendly locals and service Recommended
Bad smell bad toilets bad mood of the bartender On the positive side the bar design is nice prices are ok City center location
It is a good bar and open at night You can drink both local and international beers and cocktails
Great Bar nice drinks with reasonable prices The bartender was kind and capable They have big screen so you can watch your favourite sport events Nice atmosphere and central location
If youre looking for a bar and a great view youve come to the place The menu is full of options from nonalcoholic beer to margaritas The vintage rocker vibes definitely add to the experience Staff is really welcoming and sweet1010 rating Im in love with this aesthetic
Absolutely briliant place Combines footballs fans culture and the rock from late 90s The visitors are very diverse It has a smokers room as well Reasonably priced alcohol and friendly staff makes it one if the best places in Plovdiv for a night out
If you want a rock pub this is exactly what this bar is Good service good food and good experience The only thing that was a bit weird was that there was no ventilation at all and there was not enough air

Great bands performing in front of the pub  worth listening
My visit to Morado Bar  Dinner in Plovdiv was a truly delightful experience I started my meal with the Bulgarian clear chicken soup which left a lasting impression The portion was substantial served hot and exquisitely seasoned It was a comforting and flavorsome choice making for a light yet satisfying dinner  For my main course I opted for the mixed bruschetta a trio featuring mozzarella prosciutto and salmon Each bruschetta had its unique and delightful twist offering a diverse range of flavors The mozzarella was creamy the prosciutto added a savory punch and the salmon provided a refreshing seafood twist It left me thoroughly content  The ambience at Morado Bar  Dinner was enchanting with a breathtaking view of the Singing Fountains Lake which is the highlight of Tsar Simeons Garden The lounge bars setting was truly wonderful providing a picturesque backdrop for an exceptional dining experience  Morado Bar  Dinner not only impressed with its delectable food but also offered a scenic and serene musical atmosphere Its a perfect choice for anyone looking to combine great cuisine with a stunning view in Plovdiv
Absolutely disappointed Beautiful place with really bad food Everything is prepared much much earlier probably somewhere else no spices low quality products and instant ingredients Like mushroom sauce Risotto Common rice without the salt and spices But prices like for a good quality dinners  PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE Very close you can find good street food with friendly service But not here
Food is really low quality feels like they are using expired ingredients  Service is really bad  They dont take responsibility for the problems in the food and drinks  Would not recommend
A wonderful pool view and a quiet environment The food is of good quality Ordering takes a little long I advise
This place is located in an authentical building with beautiful artwork from outside of the building It has nice and homy atmosphere Beer selection is not great but there are few interessting options People are friendly
The newest bar in Kapana with mostly local craft beers Nice place and friendly service
Nice selection of beers and good atmosphere pleasant friendly staff Great place for meeting friends for a catchup
I attended the opening night it was full but surprisingly calm and pleasent The beers are all local and range greatly in price and taste Staff are all young and friendly people very talkative and helpful I highly recommend the place for a good summer night with beer or with drinks in general
Really cool place Plovdiv needed a rock bar like this and thanks to it is a better city
Dont go there At a concert a crazy guy attacked me pulled my hair and threatened to punch me for no reason the owner didnt throw this trouble maker out he acted like its no big deal Reason he told me the Amok guy knows many people  probably didnt want to loose a heavy drinking customer seems more important than the safety of the guests he was even allowed to continue drinking after this Not a single security man was present although it was a concert place full with people and heavy alcohol consumption Avoid this place if you dont want an experience like this for the aggressive trouble makers are apparently not banned from the place but always welcome and no one is there to hold them back
The bar is smashing Absolutely fantastic place which turns into a concert venue and provides great feelings for both bands and the fans Drinks reasonably priced Very friendly the staff
Good location Very good sound FroydZvezdoletPretty Bad concert was great Inviting young trendy bands is an excellent idea
Fresh atmosphere positive staff and a good opportunity to unwind I recommend the draft beer
Super nice new place Fresh lemonades fresh and a wide selection of beers I recommend
Very nice place The bartender is very smiling and kind I recommend
Very cool place I highly recommend
Wanted to find a good coffee place and found this lovely little bar It ia selfservice and and has various choices on the menu Coffee is not so great I would expect more options according to google advice but definitely not a bad find It is super cute Recommended
Great food  reasonable prices there are enough options on the menu everything we tried tasted amazing Great service very nice location
Ive been to so many bars in Bulgaria but most waiters hardly speak English and are often not nice The main waitres Anelia speaks English really well and is really nice The bar is really nice too
Great bar and great beer The highlight of the evening was Anelia a wonderful barmaid and a great host And a geography expert
A very nice  cozy bar with a warm welcoming atmosphere It offers live performances along with a rich bar  reasonable prices On the weekends it may be extremely crowded especially after 9 PM
The breakfast was nice but the girls serving was so bad We ask about the bill 3 times and after more then 30min when we went to them cause they didnt come they were just laughing about us To looking good is not everything you should take care if you hire a server
The food tasted ok but it would have been a better experience if we got it simultaneously for all 6 people and if it was warmer Service is not good at all We even got the wrong dish Prices are ok We have received much better service and better food at other restaurants in Varna
Ordered egg an bacon took about 25 minutes and then it was cold on arrival It had obvisioly been standing for a long time in the kitchen without being picked up No apologies or offer to fix a new dish so we left
Situated in the basement of building from the end of the 19th century Three Lions Pub offers cozy atmosphere and wide selection of craft beers on tap and bottles Good food on very reasonable prices Seats in open garden also available Only cash accepted Highly recommended and worthy to visit
Love this place   Full of friendly locals  Simple Bulgarian food menu and a fantastic beer list including Bulgarian and foreign beer at great prices
Fantastic staff and great food Definitely come here when youre in Varna

Really authentic bulgarian local with friendly stuff and nice atmosphere
I quite liked it Immediately after I entered I was welcomed and had a beer in my hand The food was very tasty They had a range of 5 or 6 beers on tap I tried 3 different beers The bartender provided information about each one and made suggestions Each time spot on 
Awesome place Weather turned bad last night and the bartender was super nice and kept doors open until it was safe to go  Food was awesome and beer even better I had a great time
Didnt have food but the Irish Red Ale on tap was fantastic  Service and music good  Good place for craft ale
Visited yesterday with friends from Sweden Tasty craft beers on 5 taps relaxed atmosphere and good food to keep them company The pork ribs were a delight Id recommend the place to anyone who would like to sink in the spirit of central Varna and has an interest in craft beer culture
Simply the best coziest place in the city They serve a local draft Glarus pale ale which is beyond good The menu is great plenty to choose from and it keeps growing Good service live music and a basement with roman walls that are 2000 years old
Went for coffee and was so happy to find out they are serving my favorite freshly roasted Coffee in Varna  Caffetteria DIO     DIO Every business that works with other local businesses gets my vote Service was friendly and positive Highly recommend
A very relaxing place in varna Downstairs the feeling is amazing Old stones and antic structure make visitors feel to be in an old castle The workers are friendly and the food is delicious Good selections of beers and drink Every night different experience Tuesday tango Wednesday karaoke and week end alive music A must to visit for night experience in the beautiful Varna
Very nice place with professionally team serving good quality stuff Price are on medium level Not to much space insie but thanks to that place have very nice atmosphere not to many people also there is posibility to take outside sits next to wide window then you do not need to go inside to order somthing you can do it strait away via open window Very nice place to visit I can recomend update I was not aware about space you have below next time when I will visit your place I will check it for sure 
Pleasant Wo calm atmosphere I was very pleasantly surprised at how affordable the prices were I hope the place retains its charm
A quiet place to drink coffee and meet friends
The place is great On the navel of Varna calm light pleasant music

Very nice restaurant with kind and friendly staff Good cuisine Cozy atmosphere Sometimes the service is a bit slow even when there are almost no customers

We had an amazing time with my friends there absolutely love the vibe and the craft beer called lady lust which I find as an analogy to the scarlet woman The owner is super friendly and lets us play music when it gets a bit late definitely recommend if you are looking for a chill night

The place offers you a huge variety of beers the owner is amazingly friendly Dont miss this place 
If I could I would leave minus 5 to this bar The coffeee I ordered not only was tasteless but the customer service was also disgusting Having paid for my coffee somewhat more than 4 I expected it would at least smellt coffee but it smelt like slops instead Avoid by any means
Absolutely spot on  Fresh ham and cheese chabatta sandwich  So friendly and polite staff Svetlana is a STAR   Thank you 
Prices are a joke but the worst part was that I bought something from their baked food and there was mold on it when I tried to notify them they told me thats not mold even though it was bluegreen colour It seems that the baked stuff they sell are not fresh and probably few days old Do not recommend
Incredible employees I will visit again
Great and cosy place for having a drink from fine selected spirits or just to enjoy meal with a friend Friendly staff and nice welcoming atmosphere

Im from Ireland and my visit here was disappointing The water was very unfriendly and if you are seeking an authentic Irish pub experience then you should look elsewhere
Good draft beer but unfortunately it was fully booked even though I stayed 2 hours on an uncomfortable chair and some tables were empty
Did not try food but the atmosphere was great
Excellent meal excellent service excellent location Excellent breakfast Visit East Sarajevo
Good place to get drink and enjoy bascarsija Draft large Bosnian beer is 5 BKM This place has also beatiful clock tower view
Very cool small wine bar Great courtyard to face when sat outside We went too early to get snacks as he gets them from an Irish Pub nearby that wasnt open yet The wine was delicious the toilet was amazingly small and we would certainly visit again
Really nice place good atmosphere The barman was really friendly and servicial 
Non smoking bar what is a rarity in Sarajevo They make nice cocktails relatively cheap Nice ambiance cosy They also seem to have good wines
Amazing pub in the old town of Sarajevo  Very modern Great cocktails for cheap prices The staff were quick at making our drinks
Good place at any day of the week It becomes full very fast But you can find place anyway Big variety of cocktails beers and nice music choice Thats what makes my decision to return here Oh and great interior design 
Adam our server was such a pleasure to have had as a server  He was more than hospitable and so pleasant and accommodating of our needs  Adam even left the bar to acquire a drink that our party requested that was not available at the pub  Service above and beyond and food was very good  Highly recommend Three of us dined and wined for 75 marks
Nice bar but 95 of the tables outside were reserved We were able to find one free table sat there for an hour maybe even more and noticed that no one came to their reserved tables Weird Beside that Mohito was nice a bit strong and affordable
Ok
Good time
Lots of different beers Inexpensive pub and polite staff Jukebox
Great place for a beer and food music
Very nice place with a good service  Specially good to watch sport games  football basketball tennis etc Bartenders are very kind and nice 
Its a betting place with electronic betting machines and a pub So you spend double the money half betting half drinking Nicely arranged new quality betting machines they just beg you to spend spend spend Drinks are on the above average pricing side so youre going home from there with empty pockets one way or the other Well youll get one complimentary drink so theres that
Great food and atmosphere Affordable prices 
Great food friendly environment Best place to watch sports in good company in a warm environment If you are into sports and food you will feel home
They told us we can pay by card but in the end we could only pay in cash At least its one of the few places offering cocktails apparently its not a thing in Bosnia which are good and cheap
Great place to have a couple of nice drops  and specific interior supported with the best selection of house music  Superb choice of spirits beers coctails and coffee bevs  In the heart of downtown
Luv this place Aromatic atmosphere
The only Hogwartsthing is the sign Nothing special The cocktails are good but just normal cocktails
Great place for all types of people offers a variety of entertainment programs great music and friendly staff
Nice pub with lot of space Not expensive friendly staff there was some good techno music when i was there with  Nice sound system 
Everything was amazing Absolutely amazing I think its self explanatory
Casual place to have a beer in the afternoon and superb to hang out with friends in the night time Love it
Great shakes teas and theres also lemonade or squeezed orange with aloe Perfect and great that we have something like that here 
Great place all praiseVery tasty shakes

Nice interior and cheap but good beer
Nice relaxing place keep doing job
Relaxing and peaceful small pub
I enjoyed that place during my visit to Mostar
Great place great vibes
Although on a great location and with a great stuff it needs just a bit of professional designers hand in decorating place Place does not follow one design language and to my inner OCD person thats a minus
Good location service is decent Your typical neighborhood caf Their main asset is the terrace quite enjoyable in the warm months
I love this place  This is my second night here not my last  As an American that LOVES hoppy clean beers this is the place  My favorite is their draft Cooltura Craft Pivo  I cant get enough of it  Hoppy clean refreshing and 5L for about 230 USD cant beat it  Hvala
Domestic craft beer nice and relax place
Great selection of local craft beer Would recommend
I love this pub its so lively yet so chilled They have the best selection of craft beers for sure Coffee too is fantastic there Atmosphere is always great fantastic seating outdoors and modern but cosy ambiance indoors You can chill out while watching the world go by Highly recommend
Its a nice local pub simple and good nice beer and price Friendly staff not so good englis but they still help u as much they can No fod so minus 1 star
Really nice place Good choice of drinks Nice music Beautiful interior Polite staff I loved it 100 recommend
Awasome atmosphere big range of drinks and best crew If ure in Mostar this is a must place to visit
Over 100 beers on menu is one good reason to visiti this place if you love beet of course 
Such an imaginative place  We enjoyed every second we spent here This is a place for every hedonist Food is more than excelent the enviroment is so imaginative and creatively made and the staff is first class So next time you visit Mostar this should be your must visit station Order a burger and a beer listen to Eric Clapton in the background and just relaaaaxxxx

Great place for coffee or beer 
Amazing small craft beer bar with ownbrewed beer as well as some others from BiH and beyond They also have delicious snacks to go with the beer The staff is super friendly and welcoming I wish I had something like this back home
Great beer garden with lots of craft beer available Good varieties available in the bottles to take away Very nice and friendly staff Cool music inside 
Yes Awesome find in Mostar Delicious fresh local beers welcoming venue good music and the opportunity to chat with the owner and hang out with Bella his pupster to learn more about his story and what inspired him to make such great beers  We tried the American Pale Bourbon Vanilla Porter and RIS and got some takeaways to enjoy as well  Cant recommend a stop by here more especially if you live a good beer
A nice twist on an Irish Stout Good music Nice view Didnt try the food but drinks were good and reasonably priced
Huge patio with fun staff and occasional live music by a onemanband playing Bosnian and Croatian pop songs from the 90s I enjoyed a halfpint of Tuzlanski pils from a freshly tapped keg If this sounds like something you wanna do make sure to ask for the unfiltered variant you wont regret it
Delightful place greate atmosphere It has game room with pool darts and many other social games
Live music with evergreen hits till 11 PM Recomendation drink is unfiltered beer from local brewery
The place is cool Its a Pub with a often played live music Excellet food and very good atmosphere different kind of beers and nice view on the city park
Friendly staff and music from the 80s what could be better
Ex yu music good beer and pleasant atmosphere
A pleasant place to hang out with bikers
The coffee is excellent
I visited this restaurant a few days ago and I could clearly notice that the staff is extremely unoriented and disorganized It took the waiter about 15 minutes to take our order the food arrived after a 30 minute wait and the contents of the plate were cold On that occasion the waiter forgot to bring the cutlery and the fiscal receipt The food was decent portions with prices that do not match the quality of the food
the pub is surpassed with the facility but only the chairs urge you to go the pizza was too much dough but not delicious it was very cozy and the people were friendly my favorite pub in tuzla
Food was great before and it was also quite affordable considering the quality Now prices have surged and the food quality is at the all time low Not to mention terrible delivery service where in some cases you would wait for two hours for your order to come
A great place to meet family and friends everyone is friendly and the atmosphere is really cool
I visited this place two times Music was nice live gig First time I ate tono pizza and it was great recommend it But second time I ordered chicken ribs and they were uncooked greasy and meat smelled strange My Guinness also wasnt strong as a real one dont know wheres the catch but for sure that wasnt real thing When I point out this to waiter he didnt even apologize or smth They are new and I hope they will improve in the future
We really love food here  Also there is live music very often  Great beer selection though a little bit pricey
Food and service were good They also boxed up the extra and added a few wedges to enjoy with it later Will be coming back
Nardi pub ex City Pub great place to visit drink Chech beer and domestic beers with great food and live music Strongly recommended if you are going to spend night out ib Tuzla
Great place for work and hangout Thumbs Up
An excellent coffee bar in an extra location with friendly staff All recommendations They have the best coffee in town

Very nice place

Best pub in Sarajevo for foreigners A lot of different beer from around the world  local breweries Nice local music creating unique atmosphere And its opened until 2 AM during the business days when everything around is already closed
If youre coming from abroad and are looking for a place where you can drink with your buddies I cant recommend Celtic enough  Everything from the atmosphere to the drink selection is amazing The bar is tucked away in a corner and is a bit hard to find but when you get here I promise you wont be disappointed Seating is mostly high chairs and tables with a few lower tables with joined seats They have inside aswell as outside seating so they offer a lot on that front  They offer food that goes well with any drink you get and might I also add The pricing is reasonably cheap  Fully recommend you visit youll have a great time be it with friends or alone
Good service and attentive Smokers bar which was a bit much at times Food smelled good and prices were cheap but I didnt try Beers were average priced but could use a better tap selection
Not the most welcoming of bars with the member of staff being fairly grumpy Its also located down the end of the side street so theres little action but does keep the outdoor seating a more peaceful retreat Theres some good music to create an atmosphere and its one of the few places to accept card payment Good range of drinks and decent prices mean its alright and worth visiting if you want an escape from the hustle and bustle of nearby tourist spots
Great place to meet with friends Pool table darts outside seating Tucked away from street noise Will have to try the food next time
I just left the bar Will be back again and again The bartenders were excellent and the beer just the right temperature They have a few local beers I have to try So no question about going back 
Piece of a dime perfect place
It was funny Beers are good
If you fancy beer and in Sarajevo  this is definitely the place to be A short taxi drive out of the city youll find this place with lots of beer on tap and even more bottled Really stands out in Bosnia
The best beer selection  best pub in the country  
One of the best pubs in the city Great selection of beers and a nice atmosphere
Awesome place where you can enjoy each season of the year differently The pub is decorated with scarfs mostly from football clubs from all over the world and offers really big list of beers and here i will add the fact that you can drink craft beer which is only served in Asterix pub Designed in a pure hooligan style mixed with irish and british pubs atmosphere with really moderate prices is a must visit Nice and cozy place where you can bring friends and family play billiards or darts and mostly enjoy beer
Good food nice restaurant good burger good location
The place is really nice something different and made with a lot of passion Food and service were great Totally recommend
This is one of those places that could fit in every town in the world great and detailed ambient with delicious hamburgers and various beers Highly recommend
Great pub with rich beer menu delicious grill and happy hours
Nice pub beautiful staff good beer
Great place there is a lot of beer going on and fast but sincerely not an every day place like everything else in Sarajevo Definitely going back
Meh Nothing to draw in anyone here really Just a fairly bland bar from what I can gather from my short visit
Drinks were very good the waiter was very interested and helped us
Two locations next to each other a pub and a restaurant Very nice service very cool location You can order pizza also in the pub Really huge screen to see the soccer games
Nice pub in the town center Its nicely decorated and seems very popular However beer selection is rather limited
Wishing the music was more chill
Poor choice of beer and catastrophic selection of music Staff also rather unpleasant
Excellent music friendly staff great food Definitely would recommend
The pub features a small interior with a large outdoor patio The selection of beer is nothing to brag about but their food is tasty and their prices attractive Try the English breakfast
Nice place good music friendly staff
An awesome place with lots of meals and drinks 55

Top place to sit with Raj Kudos to the Staff Cuba brother
April 19th 2023 at 1100 am A great place to relax with great music with a coffee or drink as well as for an evening out While I was sitting there was playing an old good music such as Billy Joel  The River of Dreams Pet Shop Boys  Its A Son Tina Turner  I Dont Wanna Lose You U2  The One Madonna  Like a virgin The staff is very friendly and professional  19042023 1100 am A great place to rest with great music with coffee or a drink as well as for an evening out While I was sitting light old good music was playing such as Billy Joel  The River of Dreams Pet Shop Boys  Its A Son Tina Turner  I Dont Wanna Lose You U2  The One Madonna  Like a virgin The staff is very friendly and professional


Very good place clean seats bar toilet and outside area Also very good and fast service
There arent that many bars that I love to come back to but this one sure is one  The atmosphere the decoration oh boy are you in for a treat I really love this bar because it has such a nice dim light wooden walls and seating homestriking music It Has Everything  But I must add that it is a little bit cramped although it isnt that much of a problem you can still walk around fine  All in all I would recommend visiting especially if you like narodna muzika
If you come to Sarajevo Ilida and you want to enjoy beer and have fun you should come to The Pub The music is great the service is friendly Place has an old pub looking style Definitely 5 stars from me
Its not bad place but its not my favorite either
As if you where in some kind of Chears version of caffeor better said neugbhourd caffe neighbourhood of 3 buildings In first one are all forigners in second is businesses it workers military local businesses and third one locals which families are in half mile for hundreds of yearsViking have conquered Sarajevo and Sarajevo love Vikingswhere you can drink all sorts of whisky and  Play games with cards chess or dominovery very strange caffe in old part of city with probable one of the best gardens for golden hour photos
Located near Old Town just along the south side of the river you can easily find this very cool place to have a few craft beers Or maybe some sodas cocktails or shots I actually dont know about that as I only had some beers but other people seemed to enjoy the other drinks as well There are 3 drafts and two fully stocked fridges with a good variation of beers Theres a steady supply of new and fresh beers from a few very fine some a bit experimental breweries in the region so theres always something new to try The atmosphere is nice open and friendly One little warning though There is only one toilet so if its crowded you might have to wait a bit for that As the bar is called Viking the interior is slightly themed Some shields fake torches and just a few other paraphernalia give it a nice vibe without being excessive You can sit inside at the bar or out on the porch Wichever you prefer We missed the monthly karaoke while we were in town Maybe that was for the best for both parties  Anyway Long story short I liked this place very much been here 16th and 17th of June 2023
Location close to Bascarsija viking themed bar good offer of local craft beers The problem was they dont take euros and they dont have terminal to pay with card Beside that the weitres gave us wrong directions for cash machine and we lost 45 minutes
Great experience Staff are really friendly knowledgeable and willing to help you pick beers you will enjoy Beers were good and well priced with happy hour Cool decorations to make it Viking theme
The Pub is the Best local Pub in town for sure Food is good service and the atmosphere is amazing Sit in shade under the oak trees the terrace is huge music is top limitless 5G internet If you dont cone to visit youd never know
Great place on a Saturday night Usually has great live music pop rock rock Yugo rock and sometimes jazz It has a garden in front where they also do barbecues in the summer on Sundays The only problem is the smoke  like every cafepub in Sarajevo smoking is allowed and after some time you eyes may start to water from the haze
Beautiful pub During summer  you can sit outside The food is from a pizzeria close by Lovely staff
all recommendations for drinking with company All drinks are billed so there is no need to worry if the waiter will charge more if you are a foreigner
The pub is excellent the waiter with glasses and canola is even better the best coffee in town
I havent been more positively surprised in a long time Great pub highly recommended
All good 
A restaurant to be praised
We tried to come here a couple of times as it is always busy I think youre going to need to make a reservation We didnt try the food but it looked good We stayed for the beer and had a bottle of Vucko I didnt like that you can smoke inside which made the atmosphere a little uncomfortable
Nice beer beautiful design especially for WO 84 lovers Not to mention the amazing ex yu music in the background
Nice place with good beer and big variety of food The music was a little too loud so it was hard to talk Kind staff Worth to visit if u are in sarajewo
Many beers and nice burgers Staff was rude and not accommodating No English menus service only when waiving over staff multiple times toilets were dirty Would not recommend as a tourist maybe nice for locals
The location is awesome and the place has a nice atmosphere Great cocktails and beer Amazing food
I added up all of the bills my table had and it was 75KM unfortunately my friend went to pay while I went out and the waiter charged her 85KM even though she said she told him its 75KM but he wouldnt return her change correctly Its a shame because I really love this place but this kind of stuff makes me not want to come back
Food is fantastic Staff is very friendly Once again food is fantastic Wow how delicious all we tried wok pasta chicken plate and chicken burger  such a cool bread Love it highly recommend to everyone 
Happy hour is greatAnd burgers are so tasty
I had a wonderful tomato soup with mozzarella The place was a little it under construction but there are some safety issues in my opinion The terrace is beautiful
DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE The Nachos were something i have never seen and nowhere near Nachos The BBQ chicken wings were not actual BBQ wings but instead dodgy small wings with a side of salsa The donuts were not donuts but literally Churros SO DISSAPOINTING
Doesnt look like much but it packs a punch Good food and drink menu Try The Dubliner Whiskey in the Londoner PUB Itll be worth your while
Excellent English style pub in downtown Sarajevo Fresh oven baked home made pretzels free of charge Excellent local and import beer available on tap and in bottles Food available too but I didnt try any but it looked top notch super friendly English speaking staff Free wifi and excellent outdoor terrace that is surrounded by other bars and terraces One block south of the BBI Center Highly recommended
We were there twice during our stay in Sarajevo Once during daytime and once in the evening till closing time  During the day there were only a few other customers but the atmosphere was very nice and friendly The waiter was a bit weird but also a funny and very friendly guy He even mixed us a drink that wasnt on the menu after we explained it to him and the price was ok  At nighttime it was packed It was ExYu Rock night and a cover band called DerneX was playing The atmosphere was amazing and the staff had all hands on deck to keep up with the orders But they did a great job Same goes for the band The prices were a bit higher because of the live music but it was totally worth it My recommendation would be to inform yourself when theres live music and to then plan your visit accordingly
Amazing local pub in Sarajevo old bazaar They have live music The prices are great 
Good music but they charged us 25 percent more What they say is prices are changed As you can see at the menu and receipt But music was great
The pub is awesome Every time Im in Sarajevo I visit it The atmosphere the music the service I wasnt hungry but I wanted something light but tasty The waiter took me to the kitchen to explain to the the chef what I needed Everyone is just extraordinary to make you feel great The only thing Im not a fan of is smoking inside Smoking inside made me leave the pub early although Ive had a wonderful time
Great place for pool
One of best places to play snooker The waiter scammed me and my friends for 23KM and that was 575 of out total reciept Review by sarajevofood2021
Nice place kind presonel
Great pub especially if you are a snooker and billiard fan Polite service and cozy enviroment makes you want to stay longer
I had the best time in this bar Friendly bartenders and waiters The Dj was a good entertainer as well I traveled alone and met couples of nice people from there As a girl who travels alone  I highly recommended For the toilet matter I understand the other reviews that complain about it But on another hand the guy is doing his job well The toilet is well kept Yet you get what you paid for
You and your manager who washes glasses and is meant only for that kindly mind your own business We paid the bill in total and only to expect the waitor being racist and disrespect us saying that we get out and he doesnt want us any more of us Im Definitely sure we gave him much more business and respect over the 3 hrs spent there Never disrespected any of the staff there Definitely understand why you guys do not make similar business like dellirium I have added the image of the person who is the reason for loss in your business
Weird rule of min ordering 15 to pay by card Not very friendly Not open to discuss Typical beers not sure why such a high score except for the location
Nice large pub and has a seating area outside  Our initial friendly waiter brought the drinks Only then did he tell us that they have a limit and you need to order over 15 euros to make a card payment  After resolving that issue the 2nd waiter wasnt friendly and curt  So mixed
Nice place to go out as a bar cool music cozy atmosphere Prices are decent and wine and cava are really good
Great for a decent Irish breakfast and a pint of Guinness Decent atmosphere and outside seating area
Nice place for a good beer And thanks to the very kind and helpful staff who served us a good local beer tripel danvers and gave us the very nice glass as present
Great place for food and the staff were very friendly Met the owner Tony very friendly chap
Very lovely place with great live music that keeps on going after midnight which you wont find that frequently in Antwerp this is what makes this place a rare gam You can also dance here and have a lot of nice drinks Staff is very accommodating to your needs and very friendly
Friday night live music freat fun irish singer was rocking while drunk flamish and few tourists were dancing singing drinking and smashing glasses Recommend
Looking for a classic Irish pub experience in the heart of the city Look no further than the Irish Times Pub This charming pub is a true gem with a cozy atmosphere friendly staff and an extensive selection of drinks  From the moment you step inside youll be transported to the Emerald Isle The dcor is cozy and welcoming with a traditional feel that is sure to make you feel right at home The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable always willing to recommend a drink or chat about the latest sports news  And when it comes to drinks the Irish Times Pub does not disappoint From Guinness to whiskey the selection is extensive and of the highest quality Each drink is expertly poured and you can really taste the care and attention that goes into each one  But what really makes the Irish Times Pub special is the live music From traditional Irish tunes to modern hits the music is always topnotch and sets the perfect atmosphere for a night out with friends  In short the Irish Times Pub is a mustvisit for anyone looking for an authentic Irish pub experience Its the perfect place to relax unwind and enjoy a great drink with friends I highly recommend it
The place is nice for a drink and to watch football games The service is okay but its a weird system even after 2 rounds the waitress said that its only allowed to stay watching the game if we get more drinks in a rude way we might add So you can basically get 1 drink for 2 hours as long as you dont finish it Not a normal system
Amazing service The guys really went an extra mile to find the tv channel with Formula1 which I wanted to watch They also let me change my phone they were super kind Good selection of beers at very fair prices too Ill go back without hesitation
We spend quite some time with a large group here The staff and the bar owner was super friendly and fulfilled every wish The beer is great very good prices and super cool location Also it was very clean We had the best time here Greetings from the Germans 
A great experience I went for a Guinness as I was struggling to sort out my passport and I couldnt take it anymore reading forms  Not only did I have great Guinness  the pretty lady behind the bar helped me with forms so I got my passport days later A friendly bar and even have cocktails  Pass by and enjoy
Very Irish place in Antwerpen Good selection of craft beers lovely staff nice beer garden to enjoy a pint in the heart of the city Definitely will be back next time
Great pint of Guinness Nice friendly atmosphere
This is a nice pub in the historical centre of Antwerp I have been there a couple of times with my wife since last year The owners are quite friendly music is excellent and they have a range of English ciders with fair prices tap and bottle They also have a tap Belgian cider that is worth it It can get busy sometimes and I like to go late afternoonevenings on Sundays that is calmer It cant go wrong though
Would have given 34 starbut Audrey  managerowner  FANTASTIC Not to mention the worlds sweetest dog A wonderful welcoming atmosphere  just go The owners couldnt be more friendly  Love it here
Great location in Antwerp to visit with friends
Absolutely cracking little bar Paul was very knowledgeable about the local beers and all at a very reasonable price Top notch
Went here for a few beers and the menu did not disappoint with both modern craft beer and high quality belgian beers Talked some with the owner who was a true beer lover and gave some amazing tips and really took time to give the best service you could imagine Strongly recommend to check this place out
Great selection of craft beers  ciders Knowledgeable  friendly bartender 
Popped in to watch the NZ Italy rugby game Paul was brilliant and advised us on many delicious beers Highly recommended
Yeah a pretty nice place to hv drinks at n we wl go back again
I loved the customer service very expats friendly Nice menu cold and warm drinks
Great cocktails and service Loved the olives they gave with the drinks
Outside freezing cold but no fear The terrace is heated up plus blankets for extra warmth plus lovely staff Would for sure return to this place on a cold Sunday night
Nice winter bar large and something for everyone Not much parking



The best bar Ive ever been too Lovely service a beautiful location and the best cocktails I had in my whole life
Cosy place to drink the day and night away could perfectly serve as a venue for a party as well Cocktails are delicious and served in style
Very nice cocktail and mocktail super friendly staff amazing atmosphere and decoration
Really great quality of the cocktails just what i was looking for Highly recommended
Lovely place to stop by and have some delicious Belgian beer
Good honest Belgium bar
Pretty cozy bar a lot of kinda beers cheap and good quality great service
Friendly staff very good prices and full wineglasses Only downside is the amount of traffic passing by but that isnt something they can change sadly
The vegetarian burger is actually good Great vibes The beer selection is unbelievably good Must try The outdoor seating is solid but do check out indoors just for the decor Go to the basement to see the innumerable beer kegs through glass walls Limited option on vegetarian food
This is the place to go to if you want to take on the enormous task of tasting all the amazing Belgian beers 300 available  a literal Bible of beer for you to peruse as you try to pick which four youd like to try for your first flight Cant say anything about the food though we had the best fries at lAtelier before coming
Lovely Belgium beer bar very close to the central station with an unbelievable selection of Bottles and draught beers The barman was a real gentleman and recommended some lovely local brews Definitely worth a visit 
A busy place but I found a free table outside on the terrace Did not try the food had just one local beer which name I dont remember but it was really goodNice and cold  One thing I would change is the format of the beer menu Its just very long list with the names and prices so If you dont look it up in the beer bible you dont know what to choose It could be at least more organized so you know what category beer belongs to with a brief description Anyway I pick one from the tap and was not disappointed
Been a couple of times already and the food is delightful and carefully executed while combining tradition with fine cuisine The service is also spot on They also have quite a vast list of choices to drink to finish your dinner with
We came here for high tea Its fyi 28 per person it includes teacoffeehot chocolate per person and a variety of savory and sweet treats Although it seems nice we werent impressed by the taste of the sweets Hot chocolate not great tea really nice  service was a bit slow and they told us that they regularly dont serve high tea at 1700 even though we reserved the 1700 slot through the website Other than that they were pretty kind and helpful Nice experience but not impressed with it
Sensational restaurant Atmospheric decor Professional friendly service Delicious steak prepared exactly how I wanted it Delicious additions perfectly composed and great beer  Unfortunately the carpaccio left a lot to be desired Bland large pieces of beef leg meat Poorly seasoned  Despite the poor carpaccio I highly recommend the restaurant
The afternoon tea service was amazing The waiter was this old guy looked like Alfred from batman Pretty funny as well despite us exchanging very little words Loved the guy Staff were smiles all around great atmosphere inside Even the toilets were an attraction I rarely take photos in cafes but holy damn this place was great will defo visit again
Very good cocktails Great service Too bad it closed at 1am
Located in the very heart of the city Great view from the terrace to the gorgeous Antwerpen Cathedral of our Lady Quite pricey but comparing to other cafes in the city center  prices are average Ordered Flemish stew and it was absolutely delicious worth the price They specialise on cocktails but I recommend to try local light or amber beer on tap Toilet is on the second floor of a very old building so you have to use a really steep stairs Could be a problem for clumsy people like me lol Overall felt in love with this place and would like to return next time I visit Antwerpen 
We were approached by a waiter who informed us about a promotion offering three cocktails for 25 euros Although we initially ordered only two cocktails and had not yet decided on the promotion the waiter repeatedly asked us about our decision Despite our consistent rejection of the promotion the waiter persisted in bringing it up  After some time a senior staff member approached us and engaged my girlfriend in a discussion about the promotion Unfortunately the conversation became quite loud making it difficult for me to fully comprehend what was being said Approximately five minutes later the waiter returned and resumed lobbying for the promotion It became evident to me that the staff was under pressure from their boss to sell as many promotional cocktails as possible However we once again declined the offer  Regrettably the waiter appeared quite unhappy and concerned about potential repercussions from their boss Two minutes later the senior staff member returned and insisted that we pay 25 euros claiming that we had accepted the promotion I attempted to explain that this was not the case but he started accusing my girlfriend of dishonesty and displaying unnecessary arrogance He even questioned why she was smiling seemingly without reason In an attempt to resolve the situation I requested to speak with the boss only to be told that he was in fact the owner of the establishment for the past three years  Given the circumstances I find the quality of service we received to be completely unacceptable It is disheartening to encounter such confrontational behavior and false accusations
Small cafe with a nice atmosphere The vegan sandwich was okay in terms of taste but not worth 17 The staff was weird and felt a little bit like McDonalds
Excellent atmosphere and beautiful interiors Lots of beers to choose from and they often host live music events When its too crowded and loud its a bit chaotic to order a beer but apart from that everything is on point
This was a very fun jazz cafe bar You should check their website to make sure you can visit on a day where there are performers If you want good seating you should get there right when the performance starts or maybe about one hour after Overall a very great experience to share with friends
Beautiful place with a nice vibe the old building has a lot of different layers and cozy corners to sit in Big menu with a lot of variety and friendly staff
We didnt eat  Just had drinks and listened to the great Jazz  Super friendly staff and great drink prices  Locals love this place too
Small Irish style bar in Gent Centrum The food was homemade and good quality service was good as was the Guiness
This Irish pub is THE place to be as soon as it rains You wont see me here when the weather is nice but as soon as it rains this place is the place to chill The food is great the people are great the bar is great 
Always love to be in Irish pub Everytime we go in some place we will looking for the irish pub in tht area This irish pub in Gent locayed just in the right place Good athmosphere and cozy with friendly weitres and excellent cervice In irish pub we used to looking for celtic ciders In here the taste is different then what we used to remember Its a little bit sweater like u drink applesap Well im still borstfeading so only my hysband that drink and the children have appelsap They have outside tablle that always full specially when you coming in Ghent festival time When you coling inside the man toilet is in the links side and the women is in the rightside The bat also in the right side Well defenitly recomended place to go specially if you an celtic cider lover
I came in alone for getting one beer after an evening walk Then I finally got out at 2am   This summarizes how I felt welcomed in this nice Irish pub Thank you so much
Brilliant little bar so accommodating for us Shamrock rovers fans Went over and above for us Even went off and made us toasties All the staff were fantastic great beer Great prices great music Had good fun with the regulars Location excellent for getting around too
Small bar very hot and stuffy  no Irish vibe
The host there is unique
The best pub in Gent Official Irish neighborhoods pub Good not turistic prices Very clean and excellent service Authentic drinks and enjoyable music Congratulations
A bit tight on space but cosy and very friendly Day soup was good
Enjoy a cup of coffee in the sun with a view on the Belfort
Candle heated seats outside
Perfect
The music played in this pub is lovely and service is good Nice pub to drink some Belgian beers Its located close to the Student hostels
Popular bar under students especially from the sciences Music varies from commercial to rock to 90s
Awesome bar where you can dance and drink
Great bar for students Marginaal And sometimes unfriendly staff
Alot of whisky choices however its like on the funfair and you have a choice basically per cent and u get to pick between a range of whiskies Also the current owner feels very accurate on the amounts provided Other than that good selection overall on beers and whisky in its own good setting
Great place to be for whisky lovers This place has almost every variety of whisky from Northern hemisphere you can think of Vast variety of beers as well a cozy place and great place to experience a night of whisky tasting Plan your evening of whisky tasting here well and try the special brews ones for sure it is worth it
Beer and whiskey pairing  what is not to like For the none alcohol people they have the La trappe nillis that tastes pretty good
A very cool find The owner has a taste for whiskey and is well stocked There was live music playing the weekend we visited
This place is a fun spot to visit Great love tin with a view and fun vibe My husband got the large dark beer and he if fact had to give his shoe The dark beer was really good Hundreds of other unique beer  non alcoholic options
The Mecca and Holy Grail for all beer enthusiasts This place had the largest selection of beer in Ghent with over 500 types of beer They also offer tastings as well The best part you get a special mug specific to each beer you order and you can keep them The only exception is one large and special glass that requires one of your shoes as collateral thereby ensuring that you dont sneak the glass out I tried over 15 beers loved them all and was barely able to walk out due to the strength of the beers
I had a great time at Dulle Griet Bar It can get crowded but the wait for a table is usually not too long and the cool decorations and vibes make it worth it With 500 types of Belgian crafted beers theres something for every beer lover Dont forget if you order the 12L yard glass youll need to give your shoe as a deposit and finish the beer to get it back  a unique experience Its a perfect spot for socializing with people enjoying card games and board games while my friend and I played Never Have I Ever The yard beer costs around 1070 and other beers range from 360 to 6 They also have a variety of artisanal bierpats Cheers to a memorable visit 
Dulle Greit is strategically located in the middle of the main Street which is a major tourist attraction Its also one of the famous beer bars in Ghent Its interior is very interesting as its an old Pub house with old wooden Flemish Interiors It has more than 400 different Beers to drink It has both local  international beers available here It has both an outdoor and indoor sitting area For a beer pitcher you need to give one of your shoes if you cant finish it then the shoes remain hanging up in the ceiling I tried 4 varieties of beer and I must say they were awesome
Really liked the barmanmanager Very helpful with choice of amazing beers Great ambience Music to suit all Mostly vinyl If youre not happy speak to the barman Excellent
A more calm place in the busy chaotic party street of Ghent Big beer selection and a cosy atmosphere
Great place to go and try different beers And so much to look at and talk about
At some point the bar becomes less spacious
Well located and with two big terraces at this beer bar makes it a good place to meet and chat with your friends Service is ok beer menu is limited but the biggest down point is the stinky toilet like many at city centre
Nice beer on tap Shaded terrace Unbelievable hard chairs No receipt after paying and waitress didnt show the amount
Cozy pub in Gent has a nice view of the water if you go all the way to the back The drinks are nice But you have to pay 50 cents to go to the bathroom
Best bar in town Just go there Do check out the views from upstairs or the terras in the back in summertime and by night Good choice of beers and free wifi Update since yesterday 2712 credit cards are accepted 
We went there as a group of 4 to get drinks and the barwoman was so rude because she couldnt be asked to do her job shamed us for asking to pay separately and told us we are super annoying Needless to say avoid this place
Nice bar with terrace and beer
Excellent bar with great terrace and friendly staff
A very boheme place Nice atmosphere at the outside
Very unfriendly owner I hope this caf does not survive the corona crisis
Very good cafe in the oven gate


Great old bar in the city centre Can get very noisy with older local drinks but charming nonetheless
Really enjoyed this place very nice selection of beers and we had a couple of snack food plates to keep us going  Dont be mistaken not a cafe  as the name suggests I think I read that its one of the oldest places in Gent and used to be more of a cafe so food choices are minimal Warm and friendly  good attentive staff nice decor  Definitely recommended
This is the oldest bar in the city its located in a historical building in front of the town hall and keeps prices not too high Service is good and friendly  Toilets are renovated and clean even at the end of the day which is to be appreciated Top
Fun servers easy to talk with And atleast a bar that doesnt close at 1am Good selections of drinks
Rude waitress We waited for 45 minutes saw other people who came ordered and left befor us When I calmly mentioned to the waitress that wed been waiting for an excessively long amount of time she said that if I didnt like it I should just go some where else She asked for our COVID safety ticket after had been seated for 45 mins and thats simply unsafe
Popped in for a quick drink before our dinner reservation nice place friendly people
Nice to chill out with friends with nice cocktails
Nice place but my other half went to the toilet then on the way out of the toilets a rude waitresscleaner abbruptly demanded 50 cents to use it Abit of a liberty asking someone after they have been and especially  when you have just spent 50 euros on drinks between the 2 of you We left after we finished the last drinks out of principal
Very nice and cozy cafe Beautiful view Good pricing Very friendly staff we had a lovely chat with a bartender Also great coffee too Definitely recommend
Awesome and chill place to be kind of Retro and super cute and chill to get a Glas of beer  can only recommend them
Small Caf  Bar near the city center Not crowded like the other places Fair prices Best place in town for us 
Super cozy awesome place I stumbled across here because I asked the bar owner where to buy cigarettes and ended up staying the whole night She is amazing and everyone at the bar was amazing too Im a tourist and I definitely would not call this a tourist bar and they made me feel 100 at home They are about to start live music so definitely check this place out By far my favourite place Ive been to in Ghent and I really loved Ghent so take that for what its worth 
Great friendly bar for watching sports right in the town centre with audio and a big screen
Small bar with great energy The bartender was super sweet and I loved reading here with a beer  They also show a variety of sports games for those interested
It was a quiet day when I went so not much of an atmosphere as Such Staff were friendly and Beer was nice  Stella 3 for 033l not Bad
Great sports bat hes got any match you could want and plenty of cold Guinness on tap Cant beat it
LeFrancis CEO of followrtcwlan here professionnal eSports cklub since 2008 I went there to chill with my friends before a very important computer battle I was a bit nervous but this bar is so cool that it felt like home They have pools and darts which are always good to strenghten the team synergy and the blond lady who works there as a bartender is such a nice person I hope to go back there one day Anyway we keep in touch You may have found one of our business cards 
Great bar with pool tables and tafelvoetbal They have a good choice of local beers Trappists and some foreign beers Outside seating is provided on the balcony You can sit on the balcony and inside
We just had a couple of beers up on the balcony Nice young people all over the place we really like it
Great view on the terrace friendly owner good selection of beers and wellpriced
Bar u p
Very good cold buffet but removed once the hot one is opened Paid toilets from 11 pm Big anything frankly 1 x but not 2
Really nice and trendy place One bar side and another restaurant Evenings with DJ every Thursday
Cold buffet ok But hot dish in the form of an Italian buffet Should really do better Otherwise service in training but ok And what is THE big plus atmosphere and security guaranteed in the adjacent room
We ate here three nights last week  the food was excellent the choice of beers very good and the servers helpful and friendly  Definitely recommend
Great service by an amazing staff Good food as well
We had a ham and cheese croissant The food was excellent  and the service was a bit slow  but the downside was that the place was very very noisy Bob the American
Small restaurant I had just a caffe latte Cafe latte was tasty
A man in Goslies told me to check out this place if I want a place to taste belgian beer so I came along 40 minutes walking from the charleroi airport 20 minutes on the bus 50 from Goslies to Vieville and im here Nice place nice people nice atmosphere of a small old time village barcafe Lots of beer Love the place
Fantastic bar great selection of beers Friendly owner with a lot of passion We will be back 
Unbelievably good meal
Amazing food 
Service was prompt and polite and the atmosphere was jovial but the quality of the Guinness was poor  smelt like earwax and the pint had bits in it where it didnt appear that theyd cleaned the pipes properly  I didnt stay for another
Nice place for a drink No food can be cold close to entrance but nice cozy warm spots deeper inside
Atmosphere is okay similar like in any other Irish pub Staff is well below average Happy hour apparently only applies to women When my girlfriend ordered a beer she had to order a 3rd one or she would not get the 21 happy hour discount The bartender said she would give the 2nd one to me and so this was cheating the 21 We are sharing the 3rd now anyway will never return and give a proper 1 review Good job bartender There are many more friendlier bars in Le Carre
Would recommend the la corne Nice place with nice music and good barstaff
They used to be good but Id now really question their craft beers Doesnt taste as it should
Great atmosphere and they serve some really nice nachos for free on your table
Top place to taste what the carrs like  pleasant place pleasant service and pleasant attendance  Try it 
A nice carr place for adults with good coctails and good service
This place was mighty back in 2000 So glad its still going
Super pub with great atmosphere
Best bar of the world
Top yeah
Cool
Extra
Atmosphere of evenings of the out in town type to be compared to the Carr Audience of regulars middleaged people in their forties looking for onenight stands Drinks at the usual prices for this type of place The music played quite loud accentuates the almost disco side Friday and Saturday its reserved for people who want to dance not go and have a drink with friends in peace
The rib on the bone is announced at 14 kg Much smaller It is coarse salt nice The boy was constant unsympathetic A beautiful outdoor terrace Cleanliness of the toilets to be reviewed
Genuinely exceptional bar Each section has its own unique vibe Absolutely amazing
Quite a cozy alternative bar Very open people both those who visit it and those who work Looks like a local checkpoint I mean if you need to meet someone or just adventures  You need to come here And its in a steampunk style it looks very cool
Truly one of the coolest bars ive been to Loved the crazy decorations theres always something interesting to look at It was also my first time trying Kwak and i absolutely loved it The music was so good as well if youre ever in Lige do yourself a favor and visit this bar Its such a cool experience
Great bar in city Nice atmosphere moody decor no food but take in possible perfect selection of drinks
Super cocktails
True to its name a really nice bar The staff is nice the cocktails are nice the place is nice Everything you need to have a nice time  The board there was delicious  with regional products and well stocked the staff was welcoming and the setting warm  There was no hubbub In short the ideal place for a drink with friends or lovers we agree 
We stayed only a short time late in the afternoon to rest a little Very warm atmosphere a wide choice of beers I recommend the Smash which I personally really liked in short the bar lives up to its name
Best bar in Cork intimate good atmosphere The boss and employees are super nice I recommend it if you are interested in a nice family bar
Openly LGBTQ friendly bar Nice staff Great service Frequented by great people
Tereible service and very unfriendly towards turists Sad
Short visit but nice
Cool
Very lively bar with patrons of all ages Good beer selection Plenty of room inside and out Bartenders were busy but friendly
Great bar around the corner from the Markt Outdoor tables perfect for people watching
Super nice place w reasonable prices The olives and old Brugge kaas were delectable
Super impressed by Kim Running by herself hordes of beerthirst people Awesome service great beer and amazing atmosphere Super recommended
What a lovely find Staying at the hotel right next door so I literally stumbled into this pub and so glad I did The bartender has an excellent knowledge of beers and explained the difference between Trappist and Abbey beers with patience and also made recommendations Do stop by if you are visiting Bruges
Weve been going to Bruges for years and only just found this pub Great location helpful staff and a very nice selection of beers Highly recommended
Kind of hard to find right next to the Grote Markt and behind the Belfort in Bruges But once you make it there  its a nice place for a beer or two Great selection of Belgium beers some on tab most in a bottle and cocktails  all priced reasonably given the location  We will be back
Unquestionably the best pub in the area Im so thankful that finally I was able to find this spot for some of the best beers and drinks The atmosphere inside this pub was great and relaxing I will definitely rate them a fivestar for everything that they provided The best service ever Truly amazing Thank you so much guys
The best meal we had in Belgium considering Brussels Brugge and Antwerpen with a great service  The curry chicken with basmati rice salad and bread was perfect not too spicy  The carbonara is not the traditional one but we super recommend it  They have a lot of beers in the menu and the waiter helped us choosing the best ones
A wonderful traditional pub brilliant music great beer and delicious food What more does one need Fantastic all round
Top Thai food place never disappoints
Absolutely loved the place The staff was so accommodating and so nice Totally recommend The food was absolutely fantastic The drinks were superb Totally recommend visiting people Perfect for kids as well
This restaurant is popular among local and tourists So better to make reservation through call or walk in  Staffs are very polite and knowledgeable  Food 55 very delicious well seasoned and generous portion  Mussels are cooked with wine and comes with a huge bowl of fries  Flemish stew is very aromatic and the meat is very juicy and tender  Spaghetti are cooked well and instantly melt in your mouth
Oh wow Fabulous Food was excellent Our waitstaff Simon made it even better Gotta go here Try to get reservations though this place is popular
We managed to get a table without booking in less than 10 mins but the services on the table is super slow The waiter waitress took 20 mins to order our food despite we have request to order our food for at least 10 times I asked for recommendation and the waitress wasnt helpful and just point on the menu and walked away  The food is good but wasnt as tasty as we read in the reviews We ordered a slice chicken and its quite salty to eat by itself without any drinksbeer The onion soup is great and we loved it Quite disappointed as Ive read they served pork knuckle but they dont do it anymore Maybe tried to called before walk in to dine  Love the beer selection and its quite difficult to choose among so many options Theyve another shop down the road just serving beer but overall its fine experience and wouldnt come back again
Very busy and popular spot to get some food and Belgian beers The food was good slightly on the pricey side but expected for Bruges The beer tasting was great and the explanation given by the bartender was appreciated The service was okay but we asked for bread to one of the lady serving food she acknowledged it and then just never went to get us bread so we left without it which was a shame cause we had garlic prawns and the oil wouldve been perfect to dip it in
Absolutely amazing experience Brilliant beers and chill atmosphere My fiance fell in love with the barman 
Great tapas cosy interior with patio friendly staff and an even better drinks menu I seriously cant imagine a bar with a larger selection in Gueuze famous Belgian type of Lambic beer This place is great for having a drink and bite with your partner or with a couple of friendsrelatives Hint for the Lambic enthusiasts they have Tilquingueuze on tap delicious Ill be coming back
A lucky find in Bruges Not to far from the centre but far enough from the chaos The place is very cozy The food is very delicious we took Tacos and Gyoza and also the selection of drinks and beers is very good We will come back here whenever we will be back in Bruges
Cosy little bar with a great atmosphere and brilliant service Came here one night in the hopes of a bite to eat however on asking about vegan options for my girlfriend it turned out there wasnt much available Regardless we stopped for a drink and got some recommendations from the barman  whose name we didnt get but has a Lord of the Rings inspired tattoo on his forearm  he was super friendly and chilled
Excellent location on the square We were seated quickly and the service was prompt As others have mentioned it was a bit pricey for what we purchased but the fantastic location plays into that The tables were small and close together so the smoke from the neighboring table was a bit of a distraction
Got our order slightly wrong but our cheese and toasties were good Staff were very friendly and the atmosphere was nice Sitting under the big umbrella in the rain was a nice vibe
Very good food and drinks Also very expensive just like all the other places on the square Only option for a seat at the market is to pay above average
Enjoyed a lovely omelette here this morning It was so nice to sit here overlooking the square  Service was efficient and food was very generously portioned  I ordered a mint tea which came quite small it would have been nice to have extra water to top it up since it came with an extra tea bag
Good enough selection for a small town  Nothing special on the beer list  Was there around 1pm and the place was empty service was good and friendly
Great atmosphere but I wish the waitress would be a little more friendly
Nice place to be with friends for a drink Even if im not a great fan of their playlist 
awesome place good for drinks
Very nice little meal Good food and great service I will return with pleasure
French and passing through Namur to discover this pretty town I discovered this small brewery at the same time Super nice waitress who does her job really well the dishes are to die for and so delicious I took a piece of beef as tender as butter cooked to perfection Accompanied by a divine Roquefort sauce and its famous Belgian fries true to their reputation The service is fast and quality I really recommend this brasserie if you are passing through Namur
Valuable staff who know their dishessuperb quality meat and for a brasserie the dishes are fine and sought after For my part each meal is a discovery and a real simple pleasure while being a specialty
Very good family atmosphere and good cuisine we see regulars there who feel at home
This is the place dont look more BEST PIZZA CARBONARA EVER What a pleasure to have dinner at Don Dino The service was amazing so nice and the pizza could be like the ones that they serve at the Italian heaven  A M A Z I N G
Friendly staff and great food The food is fresh and delicious I love their pizza Their desserts are also great They are also GREAT value for money Not expensive
We were very lucky to stumble upon such good pizzeria Yummy
Amazing food in such an unexpected location We were driving towards Brussels after a long day and were greeted by great service and even better food
Nice to have a drink in such a beautiful garden Friendly service Ideal stopping point on our cycle tour
Very nice
Nice local cafe with a beautiful outside terrace and very friendly service
Super cozy caf there are not many in Kortenberg 
Beautiful location for this restaurant at Oude Markt in Louvain Very friendly service I only give it 3 stars though because of the long wait until we got our food The terrace was packed and we all possibly ordered at the same time but we waited for nearly 40 minutes The waiter was very nice and offered us a coffee for this Thank you so much
This was a nice place for a drink on the studenthub square Not so boozy as some of the other places Tastefully decorated and cool terrace outside Beer selection mixes some interesting ones with others that are more expected even banal Seems to be an LGBTfriendly bar which is nice
Great place for a hangout at the heart of Leuven Really tasty food quite a choice of Belgian beers relaxed atmosphere
Im coming to this place for the third time already Every time Im in love once again with the food and the staff such kind people My husband and I always recommend my friends and family to stop there and enjoy their dishes
Great coffee and great service It came with a side small piece of cake Great spot for enjoying the sun You cant ask for more
Nice place to go for a beer and they have a great selection of beers Chill atmosphere friendly staff
Laid back pub with good beer and good music Whats not to like
Chill and warm vibe with both regulars and new customers visiting everyday A place for coffee and beer alone or in big groups and open almost everyday most part of the day which is rare in Leuven The staff is always very friendly The place has tables of different sizes a nice couch in the entrance a terrace in the front and an indoor smoking room There are boardgames available and an ample selection of beers
I love this pub its the best Irish place in Brussels I have tasted the bangers  mash the sheppards pie and fish  chips and everything had a great quality Its my number one go to for Irish food 
Honestly its a really nice pub But pub only The interior is pretty and the staff is great Beer is good  maybe a little pricey However food just wasnt it The burgers we ordered were overcooked we ordered rare and we got more than welldone and dry Jack Daniels sause was awesome Fries were nice but not great in Brussels standards The atmosphere really compensates for the low quality of food and higher prices  Overall I think its a nice spot for a beer but the prices are a little higher than usual in Brussles
Typical Irish pub You know what you are getting Burger was good and came with a really generous portion of just made French fries
Great local place Lots of beers but also decent house wines Roasted half chicken was well cooked and flavorful Fries were exceptional Vegetables were lettuce covered with a heap of papers Not a favorite so I skipped it My companions chicken teriyaki was very good Prices are good Service is ok remembering that it is a popular bar Not a place to come if you are in a hurry Looks very crowded but there are more tables in the back room
Friendly staff speaking English The venue is very clean Decent amount of beers on tap The upper section has a pool table and darts Great for drinks and hanging out
This is a great place has a warm cosy pub atmosphere during the day and is a great retreat with a billiards room and lots of seating upstairs and downstairs with a better than usual range of beers cheaper than the rest of the bars in the area On a night that changes with the addition of live music with some traditional Irish songs mixed with modern music and the place starts jumping A group of us had an amazing time there and couldnt help but get up and dance
Fantastic staff during half final Rugby Nice beers and free water for my daughter Thanks a lot for the great hospitality
Beautiful new Irish bar in the centre Great selection of drinks music darts and pool With quality TVs to watch any worldwide sports games Definitely recommend
Fish and chips were yummy but the peas were not very authentic    Salad with falafel was great but the soda bread could have broke my foot   Overall I would eat there again    The IPA though was 65 and tasted like water  Oh  stars lost since they claim to take Moniz but they dont
There were many people because of it quite close from European commission building It was end of the working hour as well Beer and dishes were quite good Also staff was very friendly Regardless of many people our order we got quite quickly
Amazing and quick service Server spoke perfect English so I didnt have to try and translate my allergies Food was sensational My partner could barely finish his pizza as it was very filling Fish and chips were amazing and crispy Onion rings were on point especially the homemade BBQ sauce Would visit again and definitely recommend
Fantastic food excellent service and a wide range of drinks available The homemade BBQ sauce with the onion rings was particularly exquisite 1010 Outstanding
Great irish bar we came here for a spontanius karaoke and had a great time Though there are not alot of beers from the tap still nice selection of drinks and pretty cheap
Superb pub to spend an hour or so enjoying a beer or three  the 14 euro mugs are definitely the bargain to be had and are quite cold just as I prefer it I was there on St Patricks Day and they even had hats and things to wear Quite a good celebration all around
If you like a bit of Karaoke at the weekend its a good city centre pub
Descent bar Watched El classico in March 2023 Service was excellent and beer options were plenty But atmosphere couldve been better Not much music or crowd even though it was a big game on Saturday night
Great place for their karaoke sessions which happen every week I think on Friday and Saturday Very international and good vibes Food is obviously expensive dont buy it here The pizzeria just left of this place is much better
The best Irish bar in Brussels Probably Belgium Grt Guinness and very good food Will definitely recommend to everyone I know whos coming to Brussels
Quick service average prices One particular server I did not like  she took my glass with some beer still left in there and then she wanted to do the same with the nachos plate
This place was probably one of the worst pubs I have ever been to Not Irish at all just not the vibe at all Not good service bad atmosphere and rude staff Therefore there seems to be a massive problem with management Wont be going back I do not recommend this place to anyone visiting or anyone living in the area
Nice atmosphere having coffee at the excellent location close to the Berlaymont building of the European Commission
Nice pub Outdoor seating near the street was perfect for a warm fall day
Cozy English pub that knows their regulars Good beer good times Debit cards arent accepted anymore Cash or credit card only Not cool
I went yesterday there for the 1st Time No good vibes no good music no good service There are better adresses in Bruxelles
Went here to watch some rugby  It is definitely crowded during important sport events so be there in time TVs are not that big but there is definitely a great atmosphere here even though it can get quite warm inside  There is a nice choice of beer and prices are not too expensive
The best Irish pub in Brussels by far  Always has been and always will be a place that brings people together  Great service incredible atmosphere especially during football and rugby matches
Your typical Irish Pub Nice place to have a  drink or several with your friends Prices are affordable nice Irish atmosphere I warmly recommend it
Typical yet enjoyable Irish pub near the European Commission Crowds are lively and they show a wide range of sports It can get really crowded on certain occasions  One noticeable characteristic about this pub is that it does not serve food but you are welcome to order anything you want
Fascinating place with good atmosphere Not so easy to find in the everning
Nice new spot in neighbourhood lovely pint of Guinness love the darts corner


Wake me up we had the largest  tasty Pizza and drinks  The staff was just exceptionally  sweet friendly and provided excellent costumer service 
The Scotts bar is a really nice place to have a drink The atmosphere is cosy and welcoming The staff is young and speak English  Youll find a nice selection of local beers as some snacks and pizzas  Overall you will have a lovely time there  Be aware that they are sometimes concerts or football broadcasting which will give the pub another vibe
Good place to hang out Their giant pizzas are decent Last time they didnt have many of the beers on their menu  Even though Edenred ticket restaurant website mentions that Scotts accepts Edenred cards in reality they dont Other credit and debit cards accepted
All of the staff were warm and welcoming  Went for a comedy show and had a great time  Beer and cocktails were great and shared a giant pizza The bar is large and very comfortable with plenty of seating  Will definitely return
Good place to get some good shots
Very nice drinks nice atmosphere super friendly staff highly recommend
Good place for language exchange Internacional clientele And friendly staff
Great place for a good burger lunch or after hour drinks with colleagues A good alternative to the overcrowded place Luxembourg Friendly staff and correct prices Highly recommended
Excellent for large gettogethers Always had a great time at this place The bartender Luke is utmost friendly and efficient and a man of his word The place is not known for its food but there are a few reliable choices of snacks to go along with your drinks
In 2023 in the heart of Europe this place does not accept payment methods other than cash or credit cards credit not other Why Owners decision  we heard Isnt that a bit suspicious
Its your typical Irish pub with dozens of types of beer and drinks and little food to choose But the place itself is nice Cheeseburger was ok but nothing to write home about All in all good to have some beers on a Friday night
Good place to have a beer and a snack They only accept cash and credit cards
Our first visit I went with my daughter There are a couple of tables outside but they were taken so we sat inside Having looked at the drinks list and not found our favourite asked for it anyway  lime cordial with ice and water No problem  English flavour crisps available too There was a private event upstairs so no pool table Centre Brussels prices
Quite high price for not so super tasty beers Service at the bar Quite noise atmosphere
Cool place and wonderful beer however I wish it could close a bit later
Nice place to have a beer  The burger is really nice
Nice karaoke bar in town Close to Bourse one of the main tram stations in Brussels center Bar staff super friendly and karaoke with a lot of songs even in other languages The karaoke is nice and always cheers up  the crowd Ive been there many times and always have lots of fun
When in Brussels this is a nice place to drink beers and sing karaoke
Really great place the team is on point They take care of the customers The drinks are amazing good served Thank very Much
DO NOT RECOMMEND TO AVOID ABSOLUTELY Bad sound for a karaoke bar Poor quality of service Staff pretends not to speak your language in ordre to denigrate you or to not answer your questions Frequent thefts of customers bags and belongings bar staffs IS not taking any responsibility and not very understanding BAR PROTECTS PEOPLE THAT COMMIT THEFTS
The Irish way of enjoying your  Very good service and  mood especially on a sunny afternoon
Always good for a Guinness  And since we often come back for another Guinness Especially when sunshine sitting in the small front terrace with a famous look on people passing by
Great place with outdoor terrace to enjoy a drink with friends after work  Friendly owner
Lovely owner lovely staff lovely beers
A safe place where to eat meat or vegetarian food REALLY good  I like it then I continue to come back for the Guinness too 
Delicious fish and chips Big choice of craft beers
I have been here several times with friends The last two times we went here it was terrible The food has changed and become very poor for a place that was previously good for pub style food  Last visit we sat on the terrace There were 4 of us and the tables are designed for 2 people if you want to also have food We joined two tables together and the server told us One table is more than enough for 4 people We need to keep the terrace open We finished our drinks while more and more tables emptied never to be occupied Later went elsewhere for good food  As well my bank card did not function with the tap mechanism I knew it needed to be inserted and PIN used and had said this to begin but he insisted on tap When the tap did not work I was told If you dont have money maybe you should not be here Of course it worked when I was able to insert and use the PIN as I had told him  He was very rude Poor service poor food and it spoils the whole atmosphere
Great bar with great food If you like an English pub you will like it here They have great fish and chips lamb shank burgers and more Beer selection is good from a bottled beers to tap The service was quick and friendly with fair prices
Excellent bar The staff are great especially the blone lady at night Very pleasant and welcoming Been visiting from Leicester England for 3 years now and is one of my favourite bars
The waitress is awful with foreigners And in a international city like Bruxelles thats quite  weird to see
A friendly and cosy place right next to a public transportation hub Most enjoyable on warm summer days when the side windows are removed
Friendly authentic good choice of Belgian beer for reasonable prices and great place to enjoy the fries from across the square
Top 3 place to get a Guinness in Brussels Very interesting clientele frequented by journalists politicians and UKIP people
The best pub in the european area  Fred
I loved it Cheers
The beer is good The bartender got pissed that we wanted tap water It was 4 pm on weekday and place empty He was like tap water  Jesus
Looks like it was a bad day August 31 No hot water in toilet No toilet paper Gastro set includes smoked ribs  very hard to eat  A massive amount of bone pieces Guys you need to get a meat cutting machine instead of using axe in 21 century
Clean pub delicious foods but service speed is too slow Staffs are surly They also forgot some foods we ordered We asked for bill 2 times and waited a lot Waste of time
Wow Amazing service Great beer Great food Thanks guys for the perfect experience
Good Irish pub with plenty of tasty beer and  dishes and snacks They have live music where you can dance Perfect place for hanging out with friends
Were there on 100723 Pros 1 Very nice interior 2 Good music 3 Excellent service Respect to the waitresses and tips 4Clean toilets 5 Cheese sticks are delicious the sauces for them are awesome 6 Cod is delicious 7 Low prices Minuses 1 Specialty beer Rabbit Well Very amateurish Nizhny Novgorod They cannot brew beer in the Russian Federation and Belarus If they bring you beer and there is no longer a hint of foam in the glass then it is not beer At least there is Pilsner Urquell but in cans 2 Beer Glazed Spicy Ribs Blah blah blah What is in the photo is what they are This piece of boiled pork with a layer of 2 cm of fat looks like smoker ribs Bottom 3 Smelt Is this really a smelt 4 Goodys dessert Dried biscuit Its a crumbled loaf but more like a burger bun On the picture 5 Craft lemonade Strawberry Smells like mold It was redone but it didnt help Conclusion we definitely wont come here again Alas
Very good There is a large hall downstairs but we chose the summer terrace because the weather was good Everything is delicious The service is at the proper level but dont expect waiters running around youve come to a bar here you dont need to rush but enjoy and communicate They serve signature beer to try it its better to take a set of four types of beer 200 ml each we liked the dead rabbit IPA We ordered more The snacks are good at reasonable prices
The appetizer is fresh they brought it in 30 minutes The rabbit light beer is delicious cold without water for sure The atmosphere is calm there was no fuss The institution is not for children  they drink alcohol here
Atmosphere 1010 The food is delicious and arrived quickly The beer is excellent especially the dark beer The staff are great guys
I liked the food I mostly liked the interior Selection of drinks was halfway between mainstream and craft  Prices were higher than average for Minsk but still felt cheap by European standards  Thinking why it ended up being a fourstar place for me I can only point my finger at the service Call me picky but I really feel it when the staff behaves like I am not their favourite kind of customer I dont know not dressed smart enough or not ordering their most expensive stakes I like to be liked and made welcomed and comfortable regardless and sadly I didnt feel that way tonight
Nice pub Delicious fresh food comfortable atmosphere nice personal Gave me and my girlfriend a red rose at the International womens day at the end of the meal
Not crowded during the working week I visited on Tuesday Good service tasty food  a wide range of beer from light to dark Germany  Belgian Czech Belarusian Beer prices starts from 45 for 05 Liter
It is a wonderful place good beer and especially I want say thanks waiter Ekaterina and wish her good health and much money
Three women of retirement age 65 came to the establishment at 1800 ordered a set and beer The staff greeted us rudely they couldnt find a reservation in a halfempty room At 1845 the administrator came up and said that the time spent in the establishment is limited  Since when do Minsk establishments treat people of retirement age so disrespectfully Shame
Tried gastrofest Chips cabbage sausages straight from the store Fried dumplings are like Grandma Anya The ribs were quite tasty but lacked the spiciness The pig ears were interesting although Im not a fan of this dish I didnt manage to eat a lot of them The sandwich was not bad but it seemed superfluous and did not fit into the menu Sauces are just a separate type of banter ketchup with mayonnaise and mustard with mayonnaise We sat at a tiny table on which the dishes could barely fit A chandelier light bulb right in front of the forehead The only thing that was really nice was the service In general the food is ordinary I dont dare call it dishes its more like a set of products that can be perfectly prepared at home on your own Left disappointed This kind of gastrofest acts as antiadvertising you dont want to come back here
Disgusting service and work of waiters on the summer terrace It is better to visit another institution in the center since there are many good institutions nearby
Went to gastrofest today I liked it very much very tasty First time here well be back Great service
Long time havent seen it Used to be one if the best and first bar in Saint Petersburg Hope the place still keeps its high standards
Great place to watch the footy  Staff very helpful spoke English and were very helpful Menus were in English and were perfect for a few drinks watching the football
A tiny sport bar in the center of Minsk 4 draft beers several bottled Only peanuts sandwiches and french fries Barman was not very happy with customers Beware of Roma fans
We visited this bar and my friend had a really bad experience He posted a one star review The owner of the bar found him on Facebook and verbally abused him about the review He was extremely rude and impolite
I went here with my girlfriend for dinner and the experience was totally amazing Well cook food and atmosphere in combination with a beautiful Minsk area They also speak English here
New and nice restaurant in Niamiga tasty international menu excellents burgers and warm salads Live music every day at least two programs Huge spirits variety Very fair prices I highly recommend
Just a tourist scam place Awful cocktails for the price Bessonnica bar is a next level just few steps from this bar and much better
Located in the city center Good and attentive service comfortable atmosphere nothing special but cosy Prices are the same as in other cafes around Portions are big food is tasty Live music in evenings Recommended PS Buritto is very tasty and big enough for 2 girls
This is more or less an English pub let say a modern one It is clean with fresh interior which is dedicated to UK mostly England When you are entering smokers are on the right bar area with a good choice of beers and nonsmokers on the left Food is very good and prices are Okay Just be aware that they will not bring food to everyone at the same time like proper English pubs do Lunch menu food will be first and quick dishes next If you order salmon  you are the last one But this is minor  everything else is excellent
The cafe decorated with Britishstyle Food is good taste and arrive so fast Btw there is not so much cuisine like i expected and price a bit expensive Waitress can speak english  Good place to chill out in Minsk
Great Englishstyle pub in Minsk Smoking section and nonsmoking section Our food was great I ordered a club sandwich and to my surprise thats exactly what I got Just like a club sandwich in the western world
The place is famous with locals I have heard lots of positive reviews thats why I passed by while in Minsk However The  beef burger I have had was not spectacular in fact it was rather tastelesson the opposite the choice of beer was great  the place is cosy and the stuff is quite attentive Perhaps will give it a second try
I was in the pub to celebrate a gala family evening I really liked the atmosphere I even wanted to sing karaoke songs sincerely The prices are good and most importantly very tasty Pleasant service and the director Nelly Grigorievna greeted me very warmly only positive and kind words about this establishment Thank you
Great place the staff knows their stuff cozy and very tasty
A great place the price tag is just a bomb the lunch menu is priced like a canteen and tastes like a restaurant
We were alone in the establishment 4 people they carried the food for an hour the order was not voluminous
Very interesting idea A lot of sports good food nice price Recomend to visit
Very nice hot dogs you get the option of beef or chicken
Just a regular bar without any special atmosphere
Ok
You can find really great selection of draft and bottled beers here from lot of regions of the world mostly Eupore through and local beer of couse as well If you not a big fan of beer wine option is available not a bad one I like the style of this place some food pinup art on walls
Great place with good friendly service and wonderful tasting local Belorussian food Also this place has large beer selection from all around the world
Great place amazing beer selections tasty food Prices are slightly bigger than in other part of Minsk but other than that everything is superb Btw Shopska Salad in menu looks and taste like Greek salad and it is really delicious
Close to the centre of Minsk in a pedestrianised bar street Great selection of beers including some craft Belarusian ales on tap Go for the Minsk Mad frog unpasteurized ale strong in alcohol but very tasty  Worth a visit for a beer and a bite to eat Free internet and friendly English speaking staff Eclectic music Black Sabbath Iggy Pop Jazz versions of Nirvana and Irish folk songs make for an entertaining soundtrack
I like this restaurant  Nice food live music good atmosphere fast service always Good to go listen live music and eat your dinner and drink It is crowded in the weekends but not very crowded during the weekdays Try it if you are around
Really good Belarusian restaurant in Minsk Food exceeded expectations and service was very professional Also location of the restaurant is great and I really liked sitting on a patio in a beautiful summer day
Nice place to spend with friends or even alone Especially when you like live music Good solyanka soup and pork shashlik Staff very friendly Well location  Prices reasonable Nice climat  Open until 2am
Brilliant place havant been for just over 3 years Miss all the great people and my mate Yuri
Amazing place Everything is great music design prices  When youll be there try Taco It is unbelievable good  Thanks for great experience from me and my friends
This place was busy and unpleasant when I was there The service was alright but some of them smoked Shisha indoor and in front the customers who happened to seat at the bar Mind you its early August 2020  hello Corona  and majority of staff wore masks as well
Nice atmosphere good food Bartender with neck tattoo was little cocky but I guess everywhere has one
Pretty good dishes are delicious and price  nice beer rather cheap
The bartender has an excellent sense of humor and taste I havent had such a delicious beer in a long time Everyone to visit on weekends you can still cuddle the cute dog of the waitress She knows how to bring beer to the die command and to the face she lifts up the mistresss skirt 
The location is convenient the choice is limited but the atmosphere is captivating If you are a communist then you must visit
The place is nice but the beer selection is not very good
Very cozy place Polite and attentive staff Very tasty cuisine A must visit
Atmospheric place Friendly staff Good food tasty beer
Great place  cool interior and variety of snacks and drinks
We waited for potato pancakes for 1 hour 
The burgers are simply amazing with all the smoke pouring from the dome Good homemade liquor too The beer is somewhat decent Came here with friends will continue going here in the future Even when the place is crowded the staff is helpful and tries to find you a seat
The good Prices are not very high Even though there were a lot of people in the place there still were free places to sit Food is ok Servants are nice and welcoming The bad it takes a looong time to prepare the food and they usually arrive at different times so you could have half of the table with their food already but the other half will still be waiting which creates that akward moment when you dont know whether to start eating or wait Also there was too much noise at the place Overall an ok place to go for a beer
Cool Place with hilarious funny local TV  i didnt understand a word unfortunately but maybe that made it even funnier Good 3 tap beers easy ones but nice for the style and super cheap Service was fun to talk with and i learned a bit of the belarus language Food is avaible too looks very local unfortunately havent tried it So cool place but if you expect crazy beers and crazy food maybe not for you But I would come back
Scary small dirty room Dont Go Sovjet type of service
Best option for the lunch menu at Zybickaja and great value for money a bit pricey for the main menu though Note smoking is allowed otherwise i would give 5 stars
Good food and drinks at best location can smoke inside Large choice of beers and alcohol
Nice decor good service Lot of whiskey and a good choice of beer Little bit expensive for belarus conditions But its ok
Spend a whole night sitting at the bar Had good food Nice beers And good service  First night in Minsk But a very good place to be at
Nice restaurant with a good atmosphere Food portion is quite large Nice staff but too many customers
Nice restaurant with a large menu and nice variety We tried three dishes and one appetizer The steak tartar was very good and excellent quality The potatoes pancakes with beef was fantastic and my wife really enjoyed the visiting motherinlaw The beer sampler was good and gave us a chance to try four of their beers The only thing we didnt enjoy was the calamari
Atmosphere is less than good The lighting is way off The lighting tempature is around 3000 kelvins which is bad for the eyes The decor of the restaurant is very nice though Its the best thing this place has going for it  The service is very slow We sat at our table for 15 minutes on a Tuesday evening before anyone greeted us or took drink orders I ordered the beef ribs and the flavor was really good but there were only 3 bites Almost the entire thing was just fat Very low quality beef See images Literally almost all fat  The person I dined with ordered beef medallion and their grilled vegetables were cold and uncooked on the inside  In conclusion the overall experience was bad and I will not return I do not recommend dining here with so many better options around the city
Very good cafe with a lot of tables two floors and outdoor seats Theres a lot of free place for couple and for big companies As food we ordered gasrtofests set this good for two people The beef was sweet and tasty Big choice of beer and nalivok but it had too much alcohol for me better I think its cocktail  spotycanec with lemon
Unusual place with incredible atmosphere good drinks not only beer by the way there are craft beer too but also tee and coffee unbelievable concerts One of the best places in Minsk which I always recommend for guests of the city
Good place for RocknRoll  but havent too much space
Great but pretty small place Its one of few places where you can listen to informal music and great local musicians and singers
Check this venue for local live shows Cheap and simple food average priced drinks craft beer selection
Nice place Open fire dishes are just in the City Center with good view Tasty burgers and funny named alcoholic cocktails You should try it
Quite pricey but delicious cocktails wide range of drinksany types good choices of appetizers and main menus friendly staff comfortable terrace nice background music Great choice of place to stop at for a drink or for a celebration Suitable for events by little groups of people 5
Nice place with quiet background music Drinks and bruschettas were good burgers not so much but still ok
Nice place Good vibes foods and cocktails
During sitting on the bar the gard came and start pushing us dont know why
Nice
Nope
Very stylish place with great staff and good atmosphere We met here with friends from neighboring countries We had a great time and danced great The audience was very pleased Kitchen for four I was surprised by the excellent work of the security the lightningfast reaction to the person who had gone too far almost no one noticed how he was tactfully escorted to the exit Overall a very good vivid impression Cool bartenders who understand guests from their hearts Thank you guys
Bars specialize primarily in beer We ordered it and were completely disappointed The light beer on tap turned out to be warm and old the dark beer was completely sour The cuisine requires special attention namely the Caesar salad  The components of the salad are a mountain of cabbage a windheated heated chicken two Cherry tomatoes and croutons two tablespoons of mayonnaise and balsamic sauce smeared on a plate in the form of a blot The girl serving us was pleasant and immediately took action offering bottled beer as an alternative I hope this review will help your bar become better
I was very surprised and pleased by the monster cheburek a huge cheburek on the floor of the table and inside there was real meat only meat not rice not something else namely meat There are several types of filling for monster cheburek meat pork chicken ham The cost of the monster is 3 BYN  this is a very small price for it It was prepared quickly I didnt even drink a third of a glass of beer Pub 1 but only two beers on tap The selection of bottled beer is small Large selection of strong alcoholic drinks but prices X2 There are few snacks their prices are at the same level as other cafes Like the cheburek I was very surprised by the interior For the sake of the interior and the monster cheburek you can take 20 minutes and drop by there
A good pub 2a times bought their signature dish  a big tasty cheburek But the last time when I came with my wife  the meat in chebureks turned out to be stale  with a rotten smell  BIG FAILURE A small menu of beer is not strange  ITS THE SAME PUB BUT THE PLACE IS GOOD WE WAIT FOR CHANGE
Very cozy place Good selection of tasty treats Calm and comfortable atmosphere Welcoming and friendly staff I recommend
Disgusting Not the first time in this establishment We came to the performance program of the carpet band Carpet Bend Entrance cost 15 rubles But upon arrival at the bar when the group began their performance we had enough for an hour I have not heard anything more disgusting the soloist absolutely cannot sing It felt like you were in karaoke with a drunken lowing into the microphone The fact is that this likeness to a concert was noticed not only at our table but also by the rest of the guests of this institution We were 5 people for the entrance to the concert we paid about 75 rubles The amount spent did not correspond to the declared program at all Dont mislead people Value for money leaves much to be desired given that this is not the first time this group has performed at your establishment Sorry for the waste of time and money As for the cuisine the seafood pasta was disgusting terribly salty it was impossible to eat Thank you for the Cheeseburgers they were delicious Everything else leaves much to be desired The mood is spoiled like the weekend They came to you from afar from another city
A more disgusting place has not been visited in a long time The bartender is not even able to make a Mojito the pub does not have the beer stated on the menu what kind of pub is this The kitchen is terrible  the cook is not even able to fry mushrooms without burning them to black coals and bruschetta  the pinnacle of skill  a piece of stale bread with shrimps that have a strange smell You will learn how to work first and then open establishments and take money from people who came to have fun and not ruin your evening
We were at the gastrofest in May Only two tables were occupied We sat down at a table near the window but had to change seats because it was sticky and dirty covered in crumbs The veranda is very dirty The girl behind the counter smoked electronic cigarettes without being embarrassed by anyone Not the best set of this gastrofest And once upon a time it was nice to visit 
Excellent BAR super food huge portions and very tasty Celebrated a birthday  everything was great the staff is friendly welcoming always helping and willing to help you with any questions Thanks to the guys who worked on 06032023 I will definitely recommend you to my friends
Rick l and roll mather fackers Rock and roll
Norm pub
The atmosphere of the bar the friendliness of the bartender and delicious foam  do their job come back  yes I recommend it  yes
First time in this establishment and it was terrible I ordered chimchangs the menu says that this dish is prepared only with chicken but after an hour and a half of waiting due to the high workload of the kitchen they brought me chimchangs with beef  There is no limit to anger I reported the mistake to the waiter he apologized and after  half an hour they brought me the chicken I was expecting a fullfledged chicken but inside there was minced meat and with a huge amount of pepper The taste combination of the products is disgusting it contains minced meat corn and beans with some kind of sauce In the end the mood is spoiled and there is no desire to order anything else Ugh I really didnt like it  I recommend that you make references to the menu where there will be a full description of the composition of the dishes
A very nice place to relax and feel the vibe very comfortable environmentI recommend it One of the best club in belarus
Nice Space had maximum fun
Had a fun time
Gorgeous establishment Soulful atmosphere the best bartenders Denis and Philip The best b52 in Vitebsk You can also play the console and watch sports games Thank you very much for the atmosphere and top class service We will visit again and again
A unique table reservation system and conditions for visiting the establishment Perhaps the girl who greets guests at the entrance did not explain the rules to us quite correctly Impressions are mixed But We came to try the cuisine we were satisfied even very satisfied
We couldnt even try the excellent cuisine and hookah We booked a table and in the end they said that we didnt book anything Great establishment I will recommend it to all my friends
The dishes were brought quickly enough a large selection of cocktails there is no hookah card everything is negotiated with the staff when ordering a hookah From 18 to 1900 hookah  tea promotion at a bargain price The chairs are comfortable but the table seemed small there are still places behind the sofas and separate rooms The presentation of the food is beautiful For one hookah the coals were changed 3 times The waiters are polite everyone liked it
Nice atmosphere polite and friendly staff A good cocktail menu an interesting menu and a large selection of delicious treats for hookah lovers Great place to relax
It was amazing buski service Hookah is gorgeous cocktails top
Very beautiful good service it looks like a lot of money was invested
There is no establishment there are places they dont let people in they will close soon the security will help them go bankrupt
We wanted to come in for tea today after Greenwich but they didnt let us in at the entrance They called for the administrator but they didnt call him We decided that we would never set foot in this establishment again
I would put 44 points Cozy interesting There is something to try And so about to try  there is an idea If a visitor pays for a glass of draft it would be cool to give a taste of what is there Thanks for the service
Cool place with a great selection of craft beers and ciders The bar you want to go to because of the atmosphere and the staff that works there
Great bar One of the best selections of craft beer in the city Very nice bartenders
Interesting place with a huge variety of beers Nice girl at the bar
There are not enough signature cocktails The bar selection consists of classic drinks very boring We expected more from this establishment Food for two dry rolls edible salads but nothing special The tartar is average The security behaves like unfriendly people they look at you like youre meat They constantly walk around Preferably as in most establishments security should not be so clearly visible
I went several times I liked everything but lately its a game music is what goes where the direction of the techno stage You dance two tracks two tracks people just stand there DJ dont be wiser Security is also something they burn you through with their eyes let them rest make it so that you were not visible so no they walk straight along the resting people with their wings spread and look for someone to get to get down on the ground guys Ps youre not that healthy
We visited you not long ago we were simply delighted People dont get paid for nothing A must visit
There are always a lot of people who wont turn around
Whether youre there for the atmosphere the drinksgood or simply a good time Golden Harp stands out as a mustvisit Irish pubGolden Harp an Irish pub that captivates with its stunning aesthetics is a true gem The ambiance is reminiscent of Irelands warmth and the pubs look is nothing short of impressive The staff equally charming embody the essence of  hospitality  nice polite and welcoming
Kilkenny on tap Potatoes done 3 ways Kilkenny on tap Great atmosphere really feels like a local with casual familiar great service and excellent fit out feel right at home Did I mention the Kilkenny
I enjoyed the fast service also the barkeepers were very clean and friendly I would come here again for sure Ribs were also good
A nice pub to have a drink Service is good and show a lot of sports on the TV They also have live music often Food is cheap and good portion sizes Beer selection is also good with Guiness strongbow and snakebite making me feel at home as a brit abroad
The super cozy ambience and friendly waitstaff already cheered me up as soon as I entered the pub The seats were comfortable too My Irish burger was excellent  It had a gooey easy sunny side and fried bacon strips The beef patty was satisfyingly thick and well done and tasty My usual sensitive point is the burger bunsI was so glad to find them nicely toasted My partner had a vegan burger I tried the patty If I had not known I would have certainly thought it was real meat The texture and flavor of the mock meat burger patty was so real Loved it The vegan burger came with sweet potato fries and meat bur6came with regular potato fries I had an aperol with prosecco It was excellent and just the perfect thing after a long tiring day at work As a reviewer if I have complain at all the lettuce  cucumber slices and tomato piece all could have been fresher  They looked as tired and wilted as me when I came in Will certainly come here again and greatly recommend this place
Simple classic stylish irish pub Picked up to eat some fish  chips onion rings girlfriend had the halloumi burger Topped it off with an Old Mout cider and of course a Guiness Great pub food and staff was on point not overdoing nor ignoring any services for us Highly recommend anyone in Vienna looking for an Irish Pub
Love this pub The service is welcoming and nice There is a good variety of beers and ciders You can order plenty of finger foods together with them or go for a main course with a burger or sandwich for example There is a nice ambience in the pub which makes it really cozy to stay and spend time with friends
For non German speaking this PUB is well recommended Service wise we are very please and they speak english well We decided to walk from hotel but parking wise I see they have some decent parking slots nearby
This is an amazing place Great music great food and Im not even exaggerated the staff is so nice Even if you dont know German they speak English So yeah looking for a place to eat have a drink with your friends and maybe dance a little Then I recommend you going to Irish Pub
Nice pub near Meidling bahnhof at the top of the promenade Great outdoor seating with a few televisions for sports Good service good burger sandwiches and salad also Thanks Wil come back
 Kind Fast and Responsive Staff  Good Design of the Bar  Vast Selection of Food and Beverages  Medium Quality  Poor Music Selection and Sound Quality
While this neighbourhood is certainly not famous for its great bars and restaurants this Irish pub is a decent place to have a drink and bite Not extraordinary but fulfills what it promotes Waiters are ambitious also when its crowded Irish beer is cold and not over priced Worth a visit if you are around
Good pub Balkan Irish Pub Green Room is better near by
Cozy cool music good value for money
people are allowed to smoke inside this place has absolutely nothing to do with an irish pub
Irish but Serbian Nice place  cheerful atmosphere Lots of Serbian people but the experience is cool
WARNING THIEVES THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND WILL NOT DELIVER ANY FOOD DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE THEY STOLE 35 EUROS FROM ME
Oh man The best restaurant around Awesome beer decent late night pizza And its freaking crazy place Recommend to visit if you live around in hotelAirbnb to see unbelieveble
I was whaiting 2h never become pizza 3 times call them never anwser
The pub has seen better days Server is friendly though
This bar was just round the corner for us and we were pleasantly surprised that it was fairly busy every night of the week People bring an atmosphere Really lovely
Excellent handmade burgers  Tasty beer  Friendly behavior of employees It really got me interested in Ireland  The potatoes and Fried onions here are one of the best
Extremely friendly waiters nice atmosphere very spacious beautiful bar decorations They also have multiple screens to show football and other games
We have been there to watch a football game We had a ton of fun great atmosphere and excellent food  drinks We will definitely come back
The pub was fully reserved for the evening but luckily we arrived early and were able to be seated Food tasted delicious and was delivered in a reasonable time Atmosphere was causal
A wee bit of a mix up with order but harmless A good atmosphere between staff Reasonably priced not a skimpy order I have no problem recommending
The fact that they asked the money right away while bringing the beers even without having ordering food or making us pay with the food just on the table before starting to eat is awkward Everything you order you pay it right away so you dont reach the minimum needed to pay by card However good beer and food was ok
Tasty food good bier all tables were booked unfortunatelly we had only one hour for consumation even that nice experience price high but also big portion
Cool little local pub Definitely not the last time I went thereThe waitress is super nice and attentive The biggest surprise to me was the food  the Schnitzel is amazing Strong recommendation
The name suits it perfectly Dark unassuming smoky but big enough so that the smoke doesnt settle Nice staff Reminds me of the UK but with Austrian flair Great for a group or just two people
Its a nice place in a typical English pub style Prices are decent and AustrianEnglish pub food is available
super cool nice staff really great atmosphere highly recommended will come back soon for sure 
Really nice place The price was totally normal for a center bar A beer was 4 euro smth The music they played was really good however theres no place to dance A lot of cool people that you can meet there
If you want weak cocktails half filled shots and half your order to be wrong then you found the right place Dont reccomend unless you enjoy budweiser
My favourite pub in Vienna with fair prices and tasty drinks It is the best place to have a drink before partying and also for a nice evening with friends
Smell local and drink for less than 3 half liter of beer Nice place with a lot of young people If you like to sing drink and smoke at the same time welcome to paradise
Best Irish pub in Viena center Fair prices and really well decorated Would recommend to drink a couple of Guinness here
Believe the sign out front says this is the oldest Irish bar in Vienna  hard to believe its not This is a small place with mostly bar stools  but a lot of pub decor hanging on every possible inch Theres few places like this in old town Vienna and if you can find this place down the side alley definitely grab a pint
This place rocks  the atmosphere is awesome and you are sure to meet up with some interesting people to chat with  cant recommend it enough
Oldest Irish pup in Vienna with a very cool contrasting atmosphere to the city Barman was super friendly and made a mean Irish coffee
Very nice Irish pub and with authentic decor great beer and a chance to watch premiership football also was a bonus Food was really good and this pub is highly recommended for a quite drink before heading into town
Its a really nice place the staff is friendly and quick The atmosphere is great but the acoustics are so off its hard to have a conversation and thats not because of music playing but other people talking
Great well priced food and a good range of ciders The Golden Harp has an amazing atmosphere and very friendly staff I am glad we found this place
There were eight of us we sat down at several free tables but the waitress moved us to a small room where there was only one table and where it was quite cramped  Everything else was fine but that detail with the separation left a bitter taste in the mouth for what really looks nice
Would highly recommend here if youre looking for a good place to drink The staff are brilliant and extremely welcoming and friendy the patrons are also very much the same  Primary cash only with 1011 EUR limit for card payments if youre card only just buy yourself two drinks  Ill be coming back here when Im in Vienna next time
Nice pub right next to Gerngross and near the UBahnMetro U3  Neubaugasse  On the ground floor is the nonsmoker area that is a little darker with lots of wodden interior The small stairway upstairs leads to the smoker area and the toilet  They offer the usual shebang of beers national ones around 5 different ciders Guinness etc Prices are typical for a pub  Its a rather small place so it can be a bit cozy at later hours Not necessarily suited for bigger groups Otherwise a nice place for an after work pint or smaller groups
Beautiful pub with kind waiter and good atmosphere
A moderate pub on Mariahilfer Strae Atmosphere is very nice like and old English pub covered with wooden materials inside But the sound systems is not good that much and noisy crowd may prevent you taking a chat with others Beer price is quite affordable as compared to many other pubs in Vienna
Great music on a Monday night visit Staff attentive and polite and in spite of my attempt at German they didnt laugh Pub quiz was on when we arrived but too late to participate or id totally smash it Friendly locals chatted from time to time
The best god damed burger we had all 10 days in europe A real Irish bar with great staff and super good food Wiena seemd to close their kitchens at 2200 but the Bogside inn didnt close their kitchen until around 0000 Go here and order the vegetarian burger If you need meat you will not be disapointed
Huge burger that tasted great cheep beer and great staff and atmosphere Im definitely going back
Nice people Good music Delicious fish  chips Super cute doggo Very friendly and attentive staff
We had a great Halloween night there it had superb ambiente and music for alternativerockmetal people with pool tables and darts The food was better than expected Recommend
One of our favourite places in Vienna The beer is quite cheap the food is very good they play awesome music and the atmosphere is great Although it can be hard to get a billiard table 
In my opinion it is one of the busiest places I have seen but I must say that the environment is really cool the burgers are not  bad
An Irish pub probably most of the clients are from the neighborhood the prices are very reasonable the food is good the pub is ran by a very nice lady
We went there for a few beers I had a surprisingly tasty chili there Be sure to check before if there is a sports event  we didnt and the place was packed Only luck was that our nice waiter managed to get us a table Other than that the place is comfy has good beer and if you are into it there should be even a pub quiz 
Love that place Beer is great and the food is okay as well The service is a bit slow but not too bad I am always trying to sit outside  it is much better in my opinion I definitely recommend that place
So good place to chill  The waiters are so nice and speak perfectly English We were watching football there and drinking Guinness beer So typical for Tuesday night 
The pub has a very pleasant atmosphere When you sit outside you can feel peaceful with the city air Tables outside are packed at 11pm and you are asked to go inside This may be a common situation in the city After this time you can continue to drink inside
First time here and this place is amazing Live music amazing choices of beer Employees are very friendly Fair price Great time we got there and we will come once again for sure I am very happy that i finally find some Bar like this in my neighborhood  See you soon
Nice atmosphere with delicious food
If youre looking for an irish pub DO NOT come here Worst Irish pub I have ever been to Waitress could not even understand us we would try to order a drink or pay the bill and she would just blankly stare at us then walk off and go serve someone that could speak her language When finally being able to order our drink it took them 20 minutes to bring the drink
Nice place to sit down and have a pint staff were incredibly friendly and were a warm welcome to this city
Possibly the best Irish pub in town The food was great we had some burgers And the service and ambience are just something else They also offer live music sometimes which adds to the charm of the place
Wonderful night out on Saturday One man show on the guitar playing rock and blues songs great beer offering  on tap and bottled nice selection of pub food I warmly recommend the guiness beef stew Wonderful service timely and polite
This place has a beautiful atmosphere The attention to detail is beyond reproach Every detail has been attended to Many different types of beer Fast service Clean and pleasant seating Patrons are cheerful and sociable Staff of course speak English Try the local Austrian beer Zipfer blond and smooth My favorite beer while I was there Starobrno must try it
Great place to have a drink or two Maybe even three Lots of beer from around the world including several IPA choices Also a big menu for food which was okay just not extraordinary Its a very nice pub after all
This place is amazing The food the service everything I ordered The Bob Marley a vegetarian burger Turned out they didnt have any veggie patties anymore so I had to change my order up a bit Either way the burger was amazing Im not a vegetarian myself so I got a regular beef patty with the Bob Marley I also ordered some sweet potato fries and cajun fries with chili mayo sauce heavenly Finger clenching good Next to the food being this good the staff was super friendly and considerate They brought us a free piece of cheesecake as an apology for the inconvenience of there not being a veggie patty Super friendly And on top of that the waitress accidentally brought us 05L beers instead of 03L beers but since it was a miscommunication she only charged us for 03L beers All in all a great experience delicious food and a great atmosphere Definitely recommend going here
Charlie Ps is certainly THE best pub Ive tried in Vienna Great variety in drinks and truly incredible food Also the prices were reasonable The service was very friendly and the atmosphere truly incredible Perfect pub atmosphere and most of all amazing special nights Ive been there for standup comedy and party nights especially disco and I always had so much fun Such a fun and friendly place
Friendly staff cool place to hang out with friends Occasionally theres music downstairs which is a nice place to dance if you dont fancy a club Their spicy chicken wings with celery and blue cheese sauce are absolutely delicious Theyre addictively good
My favorite Irish pub in town Centrally located always buzzling with friendly people happy service and live games broadcasted Havent tried the food but looking at it it can be tasty My honest recommendation for nice party opener
Great barRestaurant friendly staff Best fish and chips I ever had Great onion rings great burger and Im extremely critical of burgers great time great outdoor seating too Will be there regularly
Nice restaurant and bar to go to Variety of beers   I had a very good burger There is live football games as well premier league I guess mostly Service was fast but we sat next to the bar so when we ordered beers we were able to get them just behind It was too crowded when we went but the service was still fast Liked it The prices are reasonable for Vienna
Authentic Irish pub with properly poured Guinness and Hendrickstonic Good music great service and great vibe Close to the university Rathaus and parlament so has an eclectic mix of students and tourists
Outdoor courtyard was perfect for watching a rugby international with tasty food cold beer friendly service and excellent result Bangers and mash was also a winner
20231116  1930 5 people Crowded Warm Service quickly Good location
Great selection of beers and ciders Seasonal food offers  truffle when I was visiting  You can check what is on tap right now on TVs throughout the pub Proper beer serving and pouring Must visit for people who love craft beer
Great Irish pub busy clearly popular with locals and tourists Good pub food great staff
Centrally located Very popular and lively Great place to watch sport matches Lots of TV screens can be seen from many angles Nice vegan burger Very welcoming and attentive staff Prices are fair
The burger was big but mediocre The sweet potato fries were good If you cant read Dutch or Italian prepare to use Google translate They dont have an English menu which is very upsetting The staff is friendly and will help you out
A chill place to have a beer and bausatz 
Nice Pub to grab a few drinks or get some food Make sure to reserve a table on weekend nights
They offer good burgers and nice selection of beers However they accept only cash so limited option of payment
Fantastic Irish pub with authentic beers and whiskeys as well as delicious food options Highly recommend to any prospective newcomers in Graz as well as anyone local whos looking for an authentic Irish experience
Best Pub in town This Pub is actually run by Irish people the only one in Graz as far as I know Great drinks tasty food vegetarian and vegan options The staff is really friendly as well and takes care of their costumers that includes asking creeps to leave when they wont stop pestering female costumers There is also a very fun Pub Quiz on Thursdays and live music for different occasions TVs show gaelic football hurling or rugby Always a great time LGBTQIA friendly as well
Honestly the best pub in Graz I come here almost every Wednesday for the live Irish folk music the staff and the owners are super friendly and love to chat Very authentic great atmosphere
Such a fantastic authentic Irish pub with great owners and atmosphere  You can go here on Tuesdays for a quiet night or on Wednesdays for some great traditional Irish music
A cozy friendly Irish themed pub Good choice of beers on tap and bottle and adequate whiskey and other spirits A small food menu  but its a pub  not a restaurant Friendly barman Prices on par with other pubs
If you youre looking for good drinks and nice people this is the right place The owner and her staff are welcoming and engaging The atmosphere in there is just great
Familiar atmosphere and live music every Tuesday night
Location its just a five minute walk from Jakomini or there is even a tram station in front of it  Bar they have lots of beer some stuff to eat like nachos The interior is very mixed up within Styles so you have constantly something to discover  Bathroom although there is just one for each gender it was clean and tidy  Staff super friendly very helpful talkative and cute
Fantastic hospitality They put a rugby game on I was looking for and made me feel right at home Highly recommended
2Brothers Irish Pub is the place to be in Graz It is a great venue to hang out with friends and family because it offers a cozy atmosphere and the staff is very friendly and attentive It almost feels like coming home
We had a spontaneous birthday party on Saturday after our reservation was double booked and saved our night The waiter was happy to make us food after the kitchen was closedthe mac  n cheese was delicious Not so much irish music but  it suited the style of the bar Definitely be back to try the trivia night Only minus was that the shots were a more little expensive than usual but altogether a very good night and great service
Place itself is mid for instance it gets really really hot and stuffy inside when it is warm outside However the staff and vibe there is amazing It is a foreign students spawner and a cool place to have a pint and maybe watch a football match If you wanna meet someone new you should definitely go there
The owner is probably the coolest bar owner in the city Only this guy is a reason to go to this lovely cozy pub
One of the most authentic Irish Pubs in Graz Starting with the ambiance even they had the classic special smell of Irish pub Also the bar tender was Irish For sure it will see me more often please let it as it is as this is Irish pub culture
Good beer good whisky good music I recommend
Had the best night together with our great barkeepers Sparks and  unfortunately Ive forgotten her name in march this year Great atmosphere typical drinks and in summary the best Irish Pub in Graz
Small very smoky pub Several items on the drinks menu not available and food is no longer offered here  old menu Pleasant and efficient bar lady
Nice selection of beer and other drinks has lots of place and a really unique ambience
Its definitely not for nonsmokers But its a classic pub with balkan and exyugoslavian music
Perfect place to relax talk and drink some beers
Great pub the staff is friendly as all hell The pubgoing Committee rates the experience as a 1010
Its a good bar and theres also a nonsmoking area so if youre like me and the smell of cigarettes makes you gag theres a nonsmoking zone and they have good drinks
Staff very friendly quirky interior in a good spot on the main street  very popular for cocktails
Excellence service and great drinkswe had fun
Very friendly and knowledgeable staff Pizza from Contra Punto next door was really great too I loved the music too very nostalgic
Good atmosphere with plenty of people but get there early if you want a seat because its very small and pretty dark Its also nothing like an English pub but still a nice enough place to visit Great pizzas
Such an unpleasant waitress Fisrt she was unbelievably rude to us just when we came in then when we came back she told us that we cant come in even tho we were sitting already at the table then when we told her that we are already drinking she gave us such an attitude I like the pub very much before but after this NEVER again
We literally just waited 15h for our pizza lile what
Very nice place very friendly
Cool place to have a drink
Beste Cocktails in Town
Best Pub in Town 
Friendly staff and the best ham  cheese toast Ive ever had no kidding
Great Pub and quite a charming Irish lad
Friendly staff less crowded and good for 2025 people
Good local pub
Great place Food is very filling and great The wine spritzer was very large Food is great  Had nachos and enchiladas  Food was served very fast I did not know that you need an app to order here But can also be discussed with ur server for the options Use app for the speed
The food was good unfortunately our group had a very unfortunate encounter with the waitress We arrived as a pretty large group but the place was almost empty The waitress was unbearable She was walking around kicking chairs to move them and attending to us aggressively We tried to pay at the end not even splitting bills and she was very scary yelling at us to speak in German and she felt moments away from being physical It was horrible and she made our group feel upset and unsafe  I do need to comment that the waiter or maybe chef was very nice and tried to smooth out the situation He was also very pleasant when he delivered food or took our plates  It was definitely not cool to be treated this way when we were a large group very calm and offering a lot of business
Spent two night here with our handball team super friendly stuff who are trying their best even in the rush hour and happy to take a drink and talk with you when its over The offered Mexican dishes are also very delicious the great selection of evergreen rocknroll hits from the loudspeakers is just the icing on the cake Well be back for sure 
A great English Pub with handsdown the best Mexican food in the city Also the owner is very kind
Every Wednesday they have good live music You should be her
Perfect place to chill out the owner is an exceptional example of being a natural born friendly bar owner Only downside might be the smoking area for some
Really good local Styrian pub Great service has dart games and sometimes live music
Super
Beautiful place for a beer or a glass of wine The waiter was very welcoming and give good advices
Very nice bar great atmosphere and host I highly recommend it
Friday best bartender in town
An local bar that you shouldnt miss if you want to experience good music conversations and drinks
Great place great food great people Lunch menus give a great value for the price Comedy nights or different events are always fun and I really like the atmosphere at Bar28
Great pub American pub food with great service and drinks Watch soccer on the big screen they even have American football playing sometimes The music is great and they have live music on the weekends Everyone here speaks English Super fun place to go with friends
Mittagsmen very cheap tasty and big portions
Incredibly overpriced cocktails with barely any alcohol in them Ordered a couple gin tonics you couldnt taste the gin at all it wasnt even the 2cl that is already too expensive for that price Definitely go somewhere else and get something better for your money
Same since ever A Rock in the waves of nightlife
Nice underground club cool people great music Live music events occasionally stoner rock hip hop metal and everything in between One of the best clubs in Graz entry is free of charge unless there is a live music event
Barclub without entry fees good prices and friendly staff Not a typical mainstream bar Go there to find some quality ppl and play some table soccer or dart MuHo forever 
nice cellar bar with cool events like pizza for free
Great beer Only nachos for food Nice place to chill on a sunny day
Great bar with a good selection of craft beer and punk music
The staff was very nice Nice apple cider and good snacks I didnt like the beer so much but thats absolutely on me cuz all my friends like it  they have lots of options
Great selection of beers and drinks While the food is limited its fantastic Even the nachos are great
The bartender and I assume owner was very nice Comfortable atmosphere 1010 would go to again
Friendly staff good food But they dont accept card payment careful of that
Good selection of drinks you immediately feel comfortable sitting and drinking a pint or two
Fun Small but serves many Sometimes crowded at night
Pro tip Nice variety of whiskey Do try the peat bog whiskey  Most waiters are charming and kind One or the other not so much Service is good quick and on point
Nice little Pub Was honestly surprised how many different beer  Whiskey they offer Whats better than watching live sports and having one or two or even more whiskey Definitely the only place I can recommend in Linz to have a drink
No complaints here Lovely place with lovely atmosphere Great Barmen Awesome place to watch a game or two
My two friends and I from Croatia had the best experience We were welcomed and seated by the most beautiful and handsome waiter He was so kind It was really crowded but immediately as we entered he got a table for us It was a little wall table but it was perfect simple and cool made us feel cool Interior is perfect for a pub many cool posters pictures and signs They offer many varieties of beer and drinks World cup was playing on tv and the atmosphere was amazing We drank laughed and had an amazing time 1010 I recommend this place  Thank you Chelsea Pub and thanks to the waiter for making our Saturday night in Linz fun  Sincerely
Super Karaoke
I got something that was expired twice and when I wanted something else she insulted me And if you order something else she ignores you Impudence
The whole bar is pretty dirty Everything seems so cheap and people save money everywhere The glasses are not clean I cant really recommend this locally
Good old wellestablished was a super disco back then
Great fun PUP pleasant ambience cozy atmosphere friendly service priceperformance ratio is also right for a nice evening with pleasant music and nothing stands in the way of relaxing Highly recommended
You dont feel comfortable there at all because you have the feeling that you are a stranger and not welcome
A very cozy pub Cheap drinks and also great opening times See you at the Christmas party
Because its quiet lets say I just like the music
Nice bar with friendly staff serving variety of drinks and enjoyable background music with regulars
Its like the TV show Cheers Linz style Simply love this place for so many reasons Its welcoming personal with a great variety of music The owner and staff are wonderful Many regulars  Where everybody knows your name Stop by for a coffee beer or soda and watch people stroll by this lovely and busy square in Linz Old Town If youre hungry bring your slice of Pizza from Samis Imbiss next door
Best beer in town
Pet friendly super beer good stuff

Very cool pub very cozy very friendly service very nice ambience
Mega dear people Hammer operation Bombastic food I enjoy it every time Immediately felt welcome 
Just perfect Large selection of drinks good burgers Champions League and much more
One of the best bars in Linz if youre over 20 Prices are reasonable music is most likely a crossover mix of all kinds and the bartenders are nice and welcoming
This bar is awesome I like the interiors the friendly staff and delicate choice of drinks Looking forward to see you soon
the waiters are nice as long as youre nice of course the atmosphere is great and it stays open longer than most others come here after 1am for best results
When it is past 4 am Roeders is the place to be o
This bar is located directly in the city center and in my opinion has the best atmosphere out of all Linz bars Theres a variety of cocktails for each taste and all types of customers I really enjoyed my time here and will surely come again
perfect atmosphere very friendly staff i  really liked all the drinks ive ordered and the service was really fast  the food is also perfect really enjoyed my time here
Very nice cocktail bar with good music and atmosphere to sit down and chill out Staff is very friendly they giving a small packs of popcorn and water on house Toilet is very amusing lots of literature to read on the walls Definitely worth to step by and try one of the famous Hemingways morning coffee
Amazing coctail bar Friendly staff tastefull drinks and the best music No1 in Linz The next meeting point
The best place in town if you are real metalhead would like to enjoy your time with a lot of funmany amazing posters and rare ones for a bands with more than 50 years of career i loved this place and absolutely i recommend there
Went to this place alone last night and I am so glad i did Paid 3 euros for a tequila shot and a slice of lemon Great owner he was so sweet and friendly Im not a hard rock person but Ill definitely go back soon 
An all time original Do not expect the waiter to be guest oriented the music to be mainstream or the menu to tell you what you can order and youll have a hell of a night there
Delivers on atmosphere If unsure what to order just ask for a beer
A MUST in Linz  We absolutely loved this bar  The cocktails are amazingly high quality and the atmosphere is so cool and chill  Claudia is very nice and we enjoyed a great conversation while sampling her exclusive cocktails  You must try the Green Poison drink  its delicious  A
Cant say enough great things about our experience here  We came to Boiler Room for quality cocktails based on the positive Google reviews but left with more than just toptier crafted drinks  Claudia is so passionate about the quality of her work and creating a unique customer experience We had such incredible conversations and learned so much more about the area and Austria in general  Really enjoyed our time here 10 out of 10 recommend 
Best EspressoMartini and Dark Age in Town
Whenever I am in Linz spending some evenings with friends at the Boiler Room is a must  Claudia is a fantastc barkeeper and owner of the bar Her cocktail creations are top notch  Thank you Claudia for the welcoming hospitality and professional drink creations Its a superb place to gather with friends
On a stormy summer evening we took refuge here and received a very warm welcome Enjoyed some wine and beer and a couple of tasty cheeseburgers It was still raining a couple of hours later The kind staff gave us an umbrella to help us get back to our hotel
Kid friendly genuine good service and people Best place in Salzburg to drink a Guinness Weird Fact Paracelsus wrote his will here on the 21st September 1541
Had the fish and chips and were quality food The restaurant was sooo buys but they kept the drinks flowing A couple a nice gents locals to the restuarant took part in helping out which was awesome Had both ciders but prefer the Strongbow on tap a little less sweet then the stibitzer If you are looking for a legitimately cold beer in Salzburg check this place out
The staff here are always so friendly and welcoming as you would expect from an Irish bar We waited no longer than 10 seconds before our drinks orders were taken by the friendly bar staff and they arrived pretty soon after that  We all had fish and chips and its probably the closest to proper fish and chips Ive had outside of the UK
Would be a nice bar but the music is way too loud They refused to turn it down even when multiple guests asked for it You can hardly hear each other but the place is way too small to partY Service was nice though
This pub is the perfect accompaniment to your night out in Salzburg Pairing the stylistic and cosy bar environment with the champion group karaoke dance floor  the venue provides an exciting end to any night of your week
Best service   nice place for a beer in Salzburg  Friendly staff
loud music pretty but mean bartenders who check your ID id skip over this one if i were you beer was good though but that means little
I called yesterday to ask for a Bundesliga Game The guy told me to come over We had some beers and enjoyed the game Really good vibe and friendly service behind the bar My recommendation if your searching for an Irish Pub and a place to watch a footy game Thank you again
Great pub Pascal was absolutely fantastic and so were everyone else Will visit every time Im in Salzburg
Nice place for a drink if you fancy something different from the usual Austrian beer Great selection of scotch whisky and reasonably priced
The girlfriend went shopping on our first day in Salzburg so like any man who has a new found freedom I headed off to Murphys Law to enjoy my afternoon After being away on our holidays for over a week it was great to be able to sit at the bar in a pub and have a chat and a great laugh with the barman He was very friendly and gave my plenty of recommendations for our trip in Salzburg Surprisingly the pint of Guinness was cheaper than most pubs in Dublin at 520 and it was a nice pint I also love Weissbier and the barman recommended Die Weisse which is brewed in Salzburg it tasted great If you are in Salzburg make sure you spend some time here you will be made feel welcome
Great Bar Great Beers Thanks for the nice evening Didi Niederkofler
Entered the bar with a group of eight last weekend and the female bartender asked us to either finish or hand over a togo drink a friend of ours still had in her hand because she forgot about it We complied handed it over and ordered a few beers at the bar when a second bartender tall dark short hair stormed out of the back room started insulting us The female bartender ignored him but we wanted to know what the problem was He couldnt answer in a proper way because during his tantrum he was busy downing a beer and repeating the insults over and over again Suddenly a third barkeeper short curly dark hair appeared and asked us to leave and we dont have to pay for anything since we didnt even touch the glasses This guy repeatedly told us he was completely high on LSD and we need to leave because otherwise the cops will show up Been here lots of times and i have no idea what kind of staff Stephen is hiring right now but he surely lost some regulars
Its just fg amazing Go there and meet old friends you never met before Drink and talk your heart out and enjoy the pizza Go there The lads are downright delightful
Arguably my most awesome pub stay during the entire trip around Europe totally random choice The barkeeper Jared was 100 awesome haha
very nice Pub with lovely people smooth place
Great place to chill nice terace and good dart playing inside

A special Pub
Super ouzo

Super Beisl
Top top top With lekka beer Definitely try it out
Good little place in Salzburg to watch football matches
Really liked this bar actually felt like a pub which is unusual because Austrians just dont understand pub culture there isnt much space for table service which is a GOOD thing because in a pub you should order your own drinks at the bar good music selection as well The smoke inside is awful maybe a smoking area or a better air extraction system is needed
Cool place for after work wind down Great staff magners on tap and all the clocks sat 10 past 10 so your never out too late
Very friendly staff nice atmosphere great chill place to spend 3 hour or so and have more than a few pints 
Welcoming and nice atmosphere a very tasty IPA on the tap and a friendly bartender I will come back 
Thank you The Irish lass behind the bar was just incredible so attentive and great fun even with a bar full of people If you like your whisky you have to visit here In fact if you like a good bar with a great atmosphere and whisky then you have to come here
What a magic place in Salzburg You go here when you want to have a nice night with your friends surrounded by an amazing vibe There is also surprising live music from time to time
The girl behind the bar gave us a fantastic professional insight of her whiskey knowledge She provided us with a well chosen glass of whiskey she thought we would like and even though I will most likely not become a whiskey drinker I enjoyed the whole experience so much This bar was the highlight of my Salzburg trip The girl was so friendly and open I cannot imagine getting a better service than hers
Had the most amazing night here Came highly reccomended by my sister The service and the atmosphere was incredible Sam and Caitriona have amazing knowledge of the drinks and are incredibly welcoming and friendly Run by an Irish family and I appreciated that they took the time to talk with everyone The highlight of my holiday Thanks again guys x
Very nice place with live music and good service I like it a lot and will recommend visiting this place if you are in Salzburg
Thank you for the wonderful karaoke evening Amazing place with amazing atmosphere Please keep making people happy
Great atmosphere and live music Very friendly staff and they have Lagavulin 16 in stock
Great place for some fun live music and draught Stiegl
Amazing experience Hidden gem we did not expect to find in Salzburg Mr Klause not his real name was a welcoming host who went above and beyond what was expected of him Mr Klause gave us an impromptu history lesson and tour of the building Relaxed environment and five star ambience WOULD RECOMMEND  We tried to go back again the next day but it was Tuesday which is when Klauses is closed Goodbye Mr Klause You were a joy
The owner mocked me so exquisitely that it was impossible not to fall in love with this place A wonderful experience that was utterly unique in a tourist trap world
Such a great owner and bartender Great beer and atmosphere
Small and cosy with an interesting mix of guests
I think this place is great and I go there regularly with some friends because we like it a lot However I must admit this place is better if youre a student or in your 20s and that is really the only caveat
Local full of possibilities to have fun with friends Table football billiard and other possibilities to get reduction of the price during Wednesday Definitely recommended to go with friends to spend some quality time together
Pros Good music Good people to talk with with  Cons Too crowded sometimes Pricey Long wait to be ordered  And also there is no order when allowing people inside Went outside to wait for somebody catch some air and then I had to wait 30 minutes to come inside again  On the meantime I saw at least a dozen of people going inside as groups of 8
Love this place only of the only few bars that actually obey the smoking laws of Austria lovely clean air and spacious great service and a pool table it actually feels like a pub which is something Austrians struggle with they dont get pub culture but this place is ticking all the boxes They good add a few more beers to the selection and maybe some more spirits Great location highly recommend it
The turkey sandwich is the best Service can be a bit slow as they are always changing staff But in general it is worth it
Very nice place to schmugg from heat to refresh and enjoy They have placed a new terrace now so you can hide from heat or rain as well and still enjoy
Excellent service excellent food
Weissbier was goodnice sitting
We had a great time in this amazing bar in Salzburg the staff was very nice and they do have some very good beers mostly Belgian beers but also IPAs Id recommend the local IPAs from Bierol and if you are into Belgian beers the Orval Straffe Hendrik and Triple Karmeliet
The only place I found a delicious IPA Decent selection of beer
Spent a great evening here They have an abundant craft beer selection which I very much wanted after all the Oktoberfest style beers The bartender was very knowledgeable about beer and will guide you with recommendations to match your personal taste Listen to your bartender he will be your Sherpa through the craft beer Alps
Great atmosphere Just ask and they will recommend you the best beer
Very tasty
Always a pleasure to be here and was not the last time 
Great stop for a drinkjust the service could be a little faster

Best of all worlds here Walked in on a Sundays evening for food and a Guinness Ended up staying for several hours soaking up the atmosphere and service Thomas is just stellar Hes personable friendly and genuine So glad I stopped by
First of all Serge the bouncer is on of the best bouncers Ive ever met Atmosphere is good interior is cool service is fast stuff is hardworking and talented It was Open night and they sang pretty good Theres subfloor with small stage me n friends weve enjoyed in music night Vibe was awesome people cool n friendly Ill be back Hasta la Vista Galway 
Place for a great evening of champions league accompanied by a small repertoire of small bites we really recommend the hamburger because despite being an Irish Pub they care about the little details they have different weekly events that you can attend periodically  the drinks are a good size and the staff speak English and even some other languages
A truly authentic Irish pub outside of Ireland Great Guinness and great selection of other beersdrinks Proper Irish pub atmosphere and the amazing service from the staff even when the place is busy 100 recommend
Best Karaoke Bar in town 1010 would recommend Very friendly staff nice snacks mostly baguettes and lovely people You can sing any song you want and if youre there early enough starts at 8pm you even get to sing more than one song You should be there early since after 11pm there will be more people Usually every Saturday and one Motto Karaoke on a random Friday every month Always a must visit when Im in town 
Went there for a couple of beers at the weekend Very nice pub and the lady that runs it was extremely polite and friendly Definitely recommend
It is always a pleasure to be here I love the atmonphere and the people are wonderful I love singing here I will gleadly return to spend my weekends here Thank you my wonderfull Bella 
Nice bar and polite lady owner  Would recommend 
Its a nice students vibes bar in the heart of the Uni Camp Sowi and here evey weekend becomes a pandemonium of people beer and music Around this very area you will find especially during the summer lots of student parties on the campus square and nearby the Galloway Irish Pub  which is a must go every FridSaturday slkinda situation 
Very cool and affordable bar nice atmosphere and people The only criticism I have is that it is too small for the amount of people that come visit every weekend and its very cold outside in the winter but other than one of the best bars in Innsbruck
Quite crowded on a Friday night but the value for money you get on the drinks is hard to beat Their 3 for 12 longdrink combo will definitely warm you up for a good night out Tip Try the makavavodka longdrink
Great bar to hang out They also accept card on a small payments
First open last close
A visit is a MUST Cool bar cheap and good quality drinks 2 large screens with live football World Cup games
Music atmosphere good Unfortunately no toilet and music selection very erratic skipper still fine Very manageable selection of drinks
Not my favourite we were there to walk around a bit after a nice meal and have a look at the city its way too loud and actually destroys the whole flair of the street there are actually only drunk young people in there embarrassingly dancing around and taunt one Really not for normal visitors to enjoy
Good food fun atmosphere friendly staff
All time classic in the heart of Innsbruck now with a new team in command Happy to see that one of our classic bars has become even better  Personal highlights Friendly and fast staff Delicious bar food dumplings burgers and they still offer the famous Krah frits Excellent choice of beer Right in the cities center
Good burger nice atmosphere A bit loud when its crowded but a good place to meet after work
Good food but not cheap  great friendly service  definitely worth a visit
Very nice atmosphere a small bay with friendly personnel and very happy to show you the menu and the special cocktails they have Real Cocktail experience definitely going back again Cheers
Amazing cocktails If youd like to have a good night with your date or friends go here and try some of their cocktails One of their waitresses was very friendly and kind She made recommendations and patiently explained the drinks to us So if you meet her youll know her wonderful attitude tip her well You can select a cocktail based on your favorite color which was fun and the surprise made it even better Oh ask about the meaning and source of the name of the bar
Really surprising signature cocktails Very tasty and a wonderful roast beef sandwich
Visited for a night cap  my cocktail was delightful and the caramelized nuts were delicious Service was fast and friendly
What a special little spot Great ambiance and good menu of beers
Great bar nice staff Good drinks
Chill bar with an attentive bartender Seems like a venue locals visit
Absolutely lovely place
Very nice bar just next to the river Inn and city museum with very modern decorations and young public A good menu for beer with their own craft brew good white with real tea leves all at very reasonable price
Cool spot to grab a drink later at night They are open til 2am which not lots of places are in Innsbruck This place has a chill vibe with lots of beautiful art decorations throughout  I enjoyed my evening there in such a comfortable seat 
Amazing beer great fresh food top service Coming here again
This is exactly the place one is looking forward in the evening Very relaxed place with nice tapaslike food They also have craft beer there with personalised mugs The falafel plate was really delicious I will always come back there
Such a cool place with superfriendly bartenders and fun drinks They made my wife the best espresso martini Ive ever had We will definitely come back next time were in Innsbruck
Great cocktail bar in the heart of Innsbruck Good atmosphere and the waiters are excellent mixologist Had a Six feet under  their refreshing signature drink Also a good selection of single malt whisky Definitely thumbs up for a pre or after dinner drink Unfortunately only cash payment
Love this cocktail bar even though its cash only the unique expertly crafted cocktails are beautiful and delicious Seating has options for dates or small groups and its open later than most places in this sleepy mountain town If you dont see something amazing on the menu feel free to ask for something custom and they will exceed your expectations Cheers 
Amazing experience I have tried new for me cocktails enjoyed nice service and the design of the bar  must place to visit for the tourists
The best Pub in Klagenfurt The service is kind drinks are fairly priced and the atmosphere nice You can play Dart Card games or Chess

Great Irish pub with style Best steel dart range in town and Carinthia 
Irish bar Live music Lovely atmosphere Friendly locals
Very nice pub in Klagenfurt Its not so big cozy and have some ales The music is very good rock I went there in a calm day and it was awesome

The bouncer must have picked the wrong job young girls are let in for flirting with him or for being revealingly dressed and others have to wait outside even though they are on the list totally rude and conceited The service inside however is great everyone is always very nice Ambiance is okay super small and very warm

Best Bar in Town
Casual bar with the best music from the 70s 80s and 90s From Queen to the Backstreet Boys there is something for every nostalgia nerd Staff very friendly and easygoing
Friendly staff and delicious draft beer The guests are very pleasant
Cozy good music laid back always fun great staff thats how a bar should be
Not as good as the other Irish bar but not bad
Nice service Guinness rocks authentic atmosphere 
At first it is a bit unusual to be spoken to in an Irish pub not in English but in the Carinthian dialect But the beer is poured perfectly and the next time you visit Villach a visit to the bar is a must
Small fine pub Interesting and appropriately furnished Very friendly and funny host
A mummy barn full of Czech people A place where you can relax can still enjoy 05 liters Top I can only recommend the toast Prepared with love
Very kind Small and welcoming Pub with good Beer and Cocktails Excellent music Vintage upholstery
It was like a second home to me even during my Sturm und Drang times The owners are very nice you can ask for any music you want there is a dart machine just a very nice place
Today July 9th we had another fun evening at Oldies Very very nice service
Very friendly staff and excellent atmosphere
Great place where I will happily return to play darts again


We booked an apartment for 4 people we had a great time clean and well equipped the owners were very helpful the location was excellent for visiting Villach We will definitely be back
The host was very drunk Its not easy to be drunker You have to do something about it Most likely Villachs best toast
We stumbled upon it by chance and obviously we returned in the following evenings too Excellent value for money Nice and nice staff the owners are really very kind Advised
Bad music staff very bad toilet completely dirty beer bottles and paper lying around
Best Bar in Villach
Cool atmosphere nice people what more could you want
Cool little place nice people and great service music fits a bit older mostly rock but fits great Prices are also okay always happy
Great local Perfect to linger 
Friendly staff nice view and good beer
My favorite spot in the city  After a long and hectic work week a much deserved drink should be at this bar  Located by the bridge where the water show is held  Not crowded very relaxing bar to chill at  However if you end up going during daytime service might take longer because theres only one person thats working  If you dont mid waiting a little bit then youre good  If youre impatient then find another place  Go check it out
Just what we needed to kill an hour in Villach Fair prices friendly staff great river views English friendly  no complaints
Pretty nice spot to enjoy with friends or colleagues Wide variety of drinks and a good recommendation for those who enjoy strong drinks
Really cool place with most welcoming owner A great little gem in the heart of the city

12 for 15L of cola Go to the bistro box and look for halffull beer cans
Unfortunately things are going more and more downhill   unfriendly karaoke DJ not TomTorro personally some temporary help  Overpriced prices  Sometimes no standard drinks like BacardiCola  You have to constantly check your change
It was really fun and the DJ was amazing Great sayings and really had fun

It was quite okay But the music is too loud for my taste What I also dont fully understand is that the staff tolerates the young people who sit in the bar dont order anything and just relax and smoke It was also questionable for me personally whether the people were even 16 years old But its none of my business  Acceptable cocktails were served at usual prices
Service was friendly beer was okay but the Sex on the Beach was more like blackcurrant juice with tap water
No drinks menu currant line with fruit is served as sex on the beach
The cocktails we drank were delicious and the service was friendly
Bad waitress the same music over and over again all in all not a good bar
We have been to this place several times with very familiar direct people I recommend it to everyone
Just good very friendly and helpful Can just be recommended
Best Pub in Townvery cozycool peoplelunch menu topwould love to go backbiker ambiencelandlords are top

Small pub in Bregenz near Riedenburg train station with outdoor dining area Open during the day converted into an ice cream parlour prices reasonable Ownerboss himself is behind the curtains darts possible Locally located in a quiet residential area Music box available Locally invites you to a cozy hock there is always someone there with whom you can easily get into conversation and there is also a small appetite because next door there is the village kebabits prices  normal as with all other doner kebab shops with seating in the same building Its actually a visit for young and old mixed people Have fun and have a nice evening
Very nice pub with super fun and friendly guests the music was varied and good and very nice friendly landlord  Keep it up

Largest dump in the Achsidlung
Many thanks to the Tivoli team for my excellently organized 60s party last night Another culinary highlight from Apple See you soon 
Very fine music club saw Paddy Murphy on 102023 Strong performance great sound
I was really surprised how big and modern the new Tivoli is The boss and the bartender were very friendly I can confidently recommend
A real win for Dornbirn and Hatlerdorf Very hardworking friendly and in tune with the times Cool restaurant with a guest garden
The owner gets violent with drunk people because of disagreements Pulls them out by their feet and hands the bartender doesnt have a handle on the cash register and collects twice even though youve already paid the waitresses drink more themselves and only serve after youve asked them several times Waiting time over 40 minutes which is not recommended and overpriced Poor treatment of their own guests In addition as a driver I was at 00 that evening
Thank you for the cool evening We had a lot of fun singing karaoke We found the cozy atmosphere very inviting The staff is friendly and very hard working We will be back definitely
Very cozy pub in the heart of Schwarzach Large selection of drinks and food With a separate dart room for experienced and inexperienced darters Very friendly service All in all very recommendable Thumbs up 
A great place to have a drink or have a great party at the weekend At the back there are dart machines and a table football table to offer an alternative program You are always served in the friendliest way and its pretty quick until you get your drinks If you are there more often the whole thing almost has a family flair as there are many regular guests who come back regularly and for good reason If there are any discrepancies between guests and operators they will always be appropriately brought to the door even if some guests then think they are going to throw themselves on the floor and go completely crazy the landlord will still be respectful and will then appropriately bring the person to the door As just happened recently Big respect for that and many thanks for the great evenings with you and with you in in my opinion the best restaurant in the area Thank you and see you soon
Saturday nights the most crowded place in Vorarlberg Ive ever seen Lots of people to meet and dance with 
Good atmosphere the DJ plays by request sometimes The top floor has a Shisha area where you can relax and get some cocktails  food
Nice place with good ambience and some table games
Good prices and very cozy
My wife and me went by on monday and we had a great time I have to mention Alban by name as he was simply great He was super friendly the whole time his cocktails were perfect and he was always in good mood and did a great service As both of us have hospitalitybar background all I can say is respect We will be back for sure
Nice place however the highlight is the bartender Alban He made our night it is such a delight to see him work and his cocktails are superb
MetalRock Bar with very decent Music Tho sometimes a bit too loud and very nice people Best indoor seats are in the back they also offer outdoor seats if warm enough  Cost for drinks range from 3 to 5
Googled Cocktail Bar  this is not at Cocktail bar
Super
So nice
Was only there briefly to have a drink Hugo is super good and Mohren anyway The service was also very friendly
Great bar with fair prices and good food Nice decor nice staff lots of events with live music We always enjoy coming here
Very sophisticated and classy bar with great music and atmosphere
Fine wine bar with a very good selection nice ambience and great service from Andrea Ham and cheese toast as an insider tip  Unfortunately the prices of the wines are sometimes too high
As a nonwine connoisseur I still dare to say that the wine selection in the Vincent Bar is great My girlfriend and I can definitely recommend the Rose The bar is also beautifully designed I think its great that the bar is placed in the middle of the room As a guest I can move and position myself more or less around The music put together by the landlady and supporting the ambience in the background is completely to my taste I can definitely recommend the Vincent Bar
Two glasses of wine 28 for 23 is a disgrace and no longer any fun We wont be coming back again
The staff in the Cuba Bar are very attentive and friendly Especially the cocktails taste great An absolute plus is that you can order food from the Kohldampf restaurant Even when its busy the employees are quick and extremely hardworking Here you really feel like you are in Cuba Casual party is also available here
The Cuba is only to be recommended Mega nice staff and very good drinks I would recommend everyone if they want very good cocktails and lovely staff 
Although I dont drink cocktails often Ive never had a better pia colada than here Nicely furnished and the staff is nice too 
Unfortunately it has progressively gotten worse in recent years When it comes to cocktails the bar used to be in the upper class and in my opinion it hit rock bottom last week  Waiting times have increased even if there are few visitors waiting times of between 15 and 20 minutes must be expected for simple drinks
Super
very nice people great and quick service excellent pool tables and delicious food We are now regulars at Ambiente
Really nice ambience the best pool billiard tables Ive seenplayed in Vorarlberg 3 wellkept dart machines hardly any broken tips and 1 really modern dart machine  Ive been to Ambiente a couple of times now and will definitely become my regular spot  Greeting Yo
Absolutely a cool location Cool bartender cool drinks very good location
Great place with good music and nice selection of wine
Great place to have a delicious and fun evening
very nice
Cool bar with a good atmosphere Perhaps the best in Gyumri to spend an interesting evening We will definitely visit again on our next trip
Cool cocktail bar in the vaulted cellar The bartender is a Pink Floyd fan so we started talking The music plays at a comfortable volume through a loudspeaker on the ceiling Very good whiskey sour For the fifth star the Mai Tai would have to taste even more original But overall highly recommended
Nice atmosphere attentive staff well prepared cocktails There is tea from China and good coffee
Excellent establishment large selection of cocktails and beer sociable bartender cozy and pleasant place to spend the evening
The most delicious coffee in the whole city
A very dirty and expensive place Unfortunately another Irish bar by name but not by nature The most we paid for a drink all weekend and it was served in a can at that Urinals were taped off like a crime scene and the only cubical in the mens was gross
Everything was very nice service was friendly and responsive Thank you Food was OK for a bar they are very friendly for smokers  One concern  more lager beer would be nice to see
Decent Irish pub We wanted to see a football match and the staff was helpful on turning on the correct channel Only music played in the whole area Difficulties on seeing the concept of the place Is this a Irish pub playing music football
3300 for one Guinness from the can No music no atmosphere Very sad
If youre looking for a fun place with a great atmosphere and good oldfashioned friendly bar staff This is the place it would be rude not to go
Fabulous bar wonderful aprs ski venue with friendly and welcoming bar staff Live music too
Good atmosphere when love music is on Other than that a nice friendly pub
Just the best place The staff are simply the best Been 6 years since I last was in but everyone still recognised me Its my local away from my local Love this place Covid safe which I hope becomes obsolete so it can return to its same old place with a buzz and fantastic ambiance And so the foozeball tournament can return too Winning that 6 years ago was honestly my greatest sporting achivement
This place tries to rip off customers by charging more than they should for drinks When we asked for the bill after they requested a random amount the manager responded it would cost us more We ignored that  When it was finally presented we could not make sense of it because it had random products on it  Food was good though
Stumbled Upon this terrific pub in the heart of the city The bar staff are beyond friendly extremely fun to cut up with Do yourself a favor and visit Pub Corinthia and bring your darts
A really nice place with the friendliest staff you could meet Decent prices also
Best place to serve good drink and music Please dont not forgot to visit 
The bar was a little dead but it was a weekday Staff were friendly
The waiter of 10 prepared me a very good San Francisco with fresh fruit very friendly and the atmosphere was very good with good music too We will return for sure
Good atmosphere place to have a drink with billiards table football and varied music and the owner of 10 Very friendly and prepared some good gin and tonics Big baby 
Place to have a good time Good music foosball billiards and darts options The owner is super friendly and he prepared us some very good cocktails
If you are looking for a brilliant prices and fantastic English speaking serviss and a great fun and bar with a life musicyou are in the right place But you better book in advance Located off the main street in Soldeu Staff is truly fantastichelpful and super understanding
Love this place By far the best place to eat or drink in soldeu Lovely traditional building great food Im a veggie and the stew here is amazing I found the food here on a different level to anywhere else Friendly bar staff up stairs in the bar both English guys really chatty and welcoming and in the restaurant downstairs two lovely friendly waitresses this is how you should feel when youre eating out Friendly and great service Brilliant place well done to the staff
Went to the bar area a couple of times to see The Shambles play Really great atmosphere Loved it  Google keeps asking me what the food was like but that is in a different area of the building so no idea
Good food good staff bar upstairs Little bit hidden but not too difficult to find in Soldeu
A trip back in time its a pub from 30 years ago and they havent touched anything Too bad they only play Latin music
I went with my partner looking for a cozy and cheap place to have a drink in Andorra Thank goodness we didnt order cocktails We ordered two rounds of gin and tonic and rum and coke and woke up the next day awful The alcohol was lousy for the record we only drank at this location We almost spoiled our trip because of this
Nice Latin music place excellent service and cleanliness
Very good atmosphere familiar to dance 
This is a great Irish pub that offers some great food and a vast variety of beers There is an outside area for smoking or just enjoy the magnificent view I came here 3x during my stay at the hotel they never had available the vegan options presented in the menu but staff did what they could adapting and suggesting food so I was not left without food my bf loved the crispy bacon tho Staff super nice and helpful Always smiling  Thanks for the service Suggestions time to distinguish vegan from vegetarian food  remove vegan options out of the menu if you dont have intention to have it served
So awesome to find an Irish bar up here This place has spectacular views fantastic Guinness and friendly bar staff Thanks a lot
We were looked after all week by Fernanda very helpful and friendly young lady  Her great service added to our good experience  We will be back
Very cosy place with a lot of interesting activities as table football billiard darts and good place for children games Atmosphere and personal are very friendly There is very beautiful view to mountains Food and drinks are delicious
Bar attached to the Magic hotel they have a wide variety of beers

Absolutely awesome cocktail bar For the price some of the best cocktails Ive ever had Friendly staff and a ton of drink options
Nice bar  delicious cocktails  great music wonderful service
Great place with friendly staff and very creative cocktails and music Best bar in Andorra 
Best cocktail bar in Andorra by far The staff will make you feel at home and it has the best rock music If you want a nice place to have a drink this is your bar We will definitely come back
We had some great breakfast here Omelette  avocado toast really nice 
Delicious food and service The waiters was vary friendly and helpful Sea view was perfect especially in the evening The only bar that serves also coffe in 830 pm Highly recommended
Its the perfect spot to relax and enjoy refreshing drinks while taking in the beautiful sea view The staff there is incredible  friendly attentive and always ready to make your experience unforgettable The relaxing atmosphere and stunning sunset views are very enjoyable Cheers to a great time at Bar Taushani  Akademi 
Very bad service We waited for 1 hour to get our food 1 hour for an egg We asked double espresso they brought single We asked for fresh juice they didnt bother to bring it all And the prices are very high for a small fried egg with nothing in it Do not recommend it at all
As any true Guinness drinker can appreciate I was excited based off the pictures to get a reliable pint but as you can see that was far from the truth Really was looking forward to a great pint but abandoned that dream following the picture added Other than that it was fine
Its the best pub in Tirana Original beer and good finger food I visit this pub every weekend
Fantastic place We loved it Their food and beverages were amazing I really recommend to go there Also staff was so friendly and helpful
The location was good However we have been to Irish Pubs all over the world and this was not They did have a huge Variety of Beers but definitely no Irish Food on the menu There also wasnt a semblance of an Irish Pub atmosphere
Irish sportsbar around the corner of a university and a big park
Absolutely all food is too salty
Nice place  Staff
Cute place I had a coffee and a croissant Both good Paid in euros and he gave me change in lek I saved having to go and change money No card for small amounts
Karaoke nights here held every Thursday and Saturday are an absolute blast The atmosphere is fantastic and its a welcoming pub for foreigners A major advantage is the strict nosmoking policy indoors
Decent atmosphere and they do good events like karaoke and I was told also live music Be aware they suddenly stop taking cards Our food order never arrived
Very good pub with a mix of locals and touristsinternationals Offers a wide selection of beers and food They also have karaoke at least every thursday
A wonderful bar far superior to the average Irish pub abroad As others say the staff  patrons are very friendly a warm vibe to match cozy decor The food was so well reviewed I decided to pick around a veggie burger even though not hungry It was truly wonderful herby veg  fries both worthy of a good restaurant It was such a wellblended taste sensation that I ate a lot more than intended Thanks New Irish pub
Great chill pub great service too delicious beer
Nothing special in an overcrowded pubs street with the same style
Nice place to have a beer with your friends
Nice place and good service
If youre for the first time visiting Tirana and want to visit the Air Albania stadium the perfect way is to come at this bar and have a drink while enjoying the perfect vuew thus stadium has to offer
Liked the place The staff is friendly To enter  the inside area you have to climb the stairs at the second floor The prices are high
The place and the drinks are good the staff was also good
Good place The staff is polite and friendly Very good view
Its a cool bar It has plenty of seating inside and outside The people running it seem to know everyone and are always having a drink The beer is good and its well priced This seems like an old man pub but everyone is in a good mood and friendly They serve Kaon beer on tap
This beer place is a gem hidden in a rather posh area Its a place that is straightforward ans amazing in being what its supposed to be Its a place for locals with a very cosy feeling and vibe The terrace its amazing and I highly recommend if the weather allows it We ate some sausages  I am from Romania and its the Albanian version of mici and they were absolutely amazing If you are into feeling something else than normal pubs and bars this is the place for you
Travelling through with my good friend Taylor This place has brilliant customer service I feel only Albania could provide I would encourage anyone to visit and experience what I did However the pigeons did my head
Best pub in the city that we have visited Friendly service super friendly people Got a scarf from Partisan Tirana as a gift incredible hospitality The food was super tasty Prices for food and drinks unbeatable Unreserved recommendation
My order was taken 20 minutes after I sat down at the table by a girl who passes by there several times and did not ask about the order
Like the neighboring bars Casa Bar is a good place to grab a quick bite andor drink a beer Gets busy on the weekends and thats the best time to feel its vibes
Liked the beer chips peanuts and atmosphere  but a waiter that calculates the bills and says X amount service not included was a first And when I asked whats the price for service the waiter replied 100 leke minimum another first Never been asked in such explicit way for a tip and I am one that gives tips even when service is terrible cause I have worked as waiter during high school and university I was in a good mood and gave those money but if it was in another time would have answer different
Beer was a bit expensive they do not accept credit cards or euros
I stopped here for a couple of Belgian beers while visiting Tirana and the staff were friendly and quick with the service Monkey nuts are dumped into the table for a bar snack which I liked must be a nightmare to clean up at the end of the night Nice atmosphere in here
Staff are very friendly and the beer is affordable It catches a pleasant breeze when its hit outside
That they dont have any IPAs on offer was disappointing but they do have an extensive menu of international beers A 05liter bottle of Paulaner Weissbier costs 400 lek and is served with flavored chips Indoor and outdoor seating smoking inside wifi available pleasant decor
Draft beer is only 350 Lek 29 Not expensive You can drink same beer in France for 5 And they play 80s song I loved that place
Small coctail bar with excellent drinks loved by Hemingway Highly recommended The bar offers not only coctails but also beers and other staff
Very lovely atmosphere kind staff and good cocktails with reasonable prices in an area there is no other alternative Not as posh as the bars and clubs in Blloku area and much more friendly staff Definitely worth for spending an evening
Very cozy place perfect for evening meeting after exploration of Tirana city Coctails were good with averagehigh prices 558 per drink 5 per beer Staff was really helpful and kind We had a great time Payment only in cash
Nice cocktails Friendly staff Lovely cat Interesting decoration
Highly recommend if you would love to have a tattoo while traveling in Tirana Albania Also Live Rock Music on her Bar usually on Thursday Friday and Saturday  A must visit place
Exactly the kind of place we were looking for the entirety of our stay in Tirana Great staff and great patrons Recommend for people that enjoy the alternative atmosphere andor people that wish to engage with others
Very bad service  Expensive drinks 90 minutes before closing the guy asked us to pay the bill for 2 beers he came without a bill and told us it cost 12 Apparently he took from us 1200 lek for 2 bottles of Heineken Dont go
Best little bar and tattoo place in the city Good music home bar feel and GREAT people from all walks of life Take the time to find it and you will not be sorry
Nice place good music but nothing really special its that kind of place you can find everywhere in Europe Staff are very rude and racist Very very expensive compared to other similar places 400 LEK for a Kora Moreover you have to make a reservation Good luck

Completely incompetent waiters dont know their own menu Waited over 30 min for a basic order Menu said 950 they charged 11
Basically this people is not ready for tourists if you re coming from wherever of the western world this club would look like mars
Highly recommended We really liked the music beer and atmosphere of this place which hosted us wonderfully on our last night in Tirana The staff even helped us find a taxi to the airport in the middle of the night  Goodbye until we meet again love from Istanbul
This is easily one of the best bars in the city This place has soul and character not to mention some good tunes We felt welcomed instantly and the owner Franki showed us what Albanian hospitality is all about A great place to meet people and hangout while enjoying a cold beer and some tasty and one of a kind shots
Fabulous local bar amazing local hand made cocktails Even had a free raki shot And the best bit real music Proper rock instead of the usual soulless euro rubbish Superb definitely going again when we are back in Tirana next weekend 
Great little bar would definitely go back and say hi to Flavio one of the best servers he kept the beer and Raki coming
Located i side Air Albania Stadium would consider it a luxurious bar The staff is very friendly Like both outside and inside area High prices
Waited there for 10 min and we got no service Thats embarrassing
Cold and very bad service
We had booked in the morning for a table for 3 people outside to watch a Euro 2020 match After we went to dinner we were told that all the seats outside were occupied even though we had booked so we were forced to sit inside The service was outrageous You had to wait 20 minutes for a beer to arrive I order something to eat and after waiting for more than an hour and a half we were told that the kitchen was empty I do not recommend it to anyone
I absolutely LOVED Radio bar Tirana Its a little gem I wouldnt have stumbled upon had I not read about it while doing some research on the city Inside is a wonderfully eclectic oasis away from the noise of the city Everything was great from the original deco to the deliciously crafted cokcktails and the excellent music Going there was a real highlight I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Tirana
Super nice place with live music on the weekends The decoration and the general ambience are really good The staff are super friendly The prices are expensive compared to other places in Tirana but the good experience of visiting this place compensates
Highly recommend this place when visiting Tirana Really good cocktails lovely staff and nice atmospheredesign We tried several cocktails and had great food also Just go here They have good nonalcoholic cocktails too And good beer on tap
We both had a cocktail Which was fine Not the best espresso martini The cafe looks really nice inside and has a lovely garden where you can sit Service was very friendly but we did had to wait a bit long
Great
Very attractive environment one of a kind
Cute

This is one of the most friendly bars we have been in durres the locals are helpful staff are polite  We have been in here nearly every day on our stay in Durres both this year and last year If you you like motorbikes you will like the HarleyDavidsons that gather here at the weekends
As a group of 6 ethnically diverse individuals we couldnt have wished for a warmer welcome Served in a timely fashion with great chat from the barman  He has now provided us many a free local mashed shot to the point I can barely recognise his political views Would highly recommend to all people especially the liberals  That was a damn good review
Possibly one of the finest places I have had the pleasure of consuming an alcoholic beverage Staff are warm and welcoming and offer a backdrop of 80s bangers whilst you slowly slip into a boozefuelled coma Would give more than 5 stars if possible
Loved this bar in Durres always a warm welcome by the friendly staff
We were surprised to find this amazing place after refusing to get into other bars that were charging 10 for the entrance and then 15 for a cocktail Oborri Lounge  Traiano Lounge At The Wall we had no entrance fee and drinks had the right price and great quality Our server was amazing even though his English was not good we were able to communicate without any issues The chicken wings were to die for and we only paid 3 for 12 wings Thanks The Wall for keeping the traditions of great Albania and for not being greedy and abusive with the rates like the other bars in town I will definitely advise everyone about this place and come back again
The place is nice but the service is slow and the burger was not a burger at all better to call it bread and meatballs
Great drinks and outside seating  The waiter was very friendly  Our double cheese burger had great flavor and was a good value  I think they make their own fries they are delicious
Come for the drinks not the service  Rude af not welcoming at all Too bad otherwise a nice atmosphere nice drinks and reasonable priced  But service is seriously lacking
Great spot cocktails were professional grade  attentively made and food was great Definitely a cool atmosphere well appointed decor and design Great stop if you find yourself in Kor
This place is amazing Great music bustling atmosphere swift friendly service and Great food We had the bao buns with pork chicken wings the republika salad and the pita with lamb and pecorino which were all supremely delicious Highly recommend going here
It was amazing that the staff made a mojito in less than one minute Reason was the staff tried to give my friend a drink a different customer refused The ice had already melted Busy place and reviews matter little but something for future customers to know about since a mojito is 600 LEK Just bad on the staff Very disappointed
Great ambient Irish republican kind of style Awesome cocktails
The rudest girlwaiter ever After mixing our orders several times and not saying sorry she was very impatient and angry toward us We just wanted a quiet dinner with the family and It wasnt like we expected  Ps Pizza was with storebought dough
Very beautiful  cozy germanthemed pub we didnt expect to find in middle of Albania  It is a classic vibe from the inside 
Great place to go eat and have a coffee The food is amazing
Very beautiful and cozy place
This night we were looking for some raki and delicious drinks In the end we were very lucky to find this place Everything starting from the atmosphere of the place and finishing with the outstanding service of our bartender was perfect We ordered couple of rakijas and two drinks The bartender was so caring he waited to ask if we enjoy out beverages And I can say that even my boyfriend who hated liquorice loved the drink he prepared for us Furthermore the prices are fair considering the quantity and quality of the product served Were gonna definitely come tommorow for more and recommend this place to our friends  PS We apologize for the inconvenience with our bill It was out fault Youre the best
We really liked it here  the guy behind the bar was really helpful and kind The bar was cool and the music was a nice break from that of other bars in Sarand There was another person working here who made inappropriate comments like joking about spitting in the drinks and other comments that would be considered harassment He only made these comments when the girl in our party went to the bar alone Its a shame really as everything else was really nice
Cant say enough good things about this place Piero and Andy  hope Im spelling them right are spectacular people Love this vibes and the atmosphere Can get an early morning coffee or a late night drink Love it
Wanna feel like a friend coming to the bar Come here and just do it The stuff here do really awesome job Perfect people in perfect place
Great waterfront Bar with Friendly Service and WiFi
Best bar in the area me and lot of local people and tourists with a great service guys You are truly amazing all of you really and the cocktails are great I will miss you all
This is the best pub in Saranda Extraordinary service very nice and helpful Also you can watch football games at the same time few  as you wish Beautiful viewinside and outside dont waist your time for looking other option just get in
Lovely clean place with great decor  not the sterile all white doctors waiting room style dazzling lights sterile style so loved by Albanian places IMMACULATE toilets with actual seat soap  loo paper Propet sized coffe mugs too
I cant review the food as we didnt eat but the atmosphere is excellent and the owner was super friendly While everyone else was interested only in football  we asked him to find the volleyball game and he was even patient enough to search the channel which was broadcasting the game we wanted to watch  There are several TVs there out of which some with big screen so its great place for sports fans but also for others  they have DJ and even karaoke Thanks again for letting two of us watch the game that nobody else was interested in 
Lovely music great selection of spirits and beers very good frappe and the bartender very kind Definitely a must stop
We were here three or maybe even four evenings while we were in kassiopi Service is super cocktails were delicious sports were on and extra bonus that you can order food to be delivered there I ordered the burger and potatoes twice because it was that good Music was fun sing along songs and they had quizzes every night Overall great atmosphere
Great bar 3 brothers run this place entertainment every night Sports bar with quiz and karaoke most nights Great place to socialize and the 3 guys with their staff put 100 effort for the customers Super pints and every other drink you like
