            In {current_year.year} it no longer suffices to have a standard CV, rather than claiming I have technical skills,
            I intend to use this app as a space to demonstrate them. It also serves as a space to work on personal projects that interest me and develop
            new skills.

            This app has been created using [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io) - a Python framework used for making web applications.
            Pages marked with a ‚è≥ are still a work in progress. I could of course hide these but I think it's important that
            I show the development process as well as just the finished project.
