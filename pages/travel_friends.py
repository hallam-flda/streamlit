was to spend a few weeks in Spanish school in Lima, Peru before venturing into Patagonia with my backpack and my tent.
There were no solid plans after that, I was just going to see what felt interesting at the time.

Early on I decided against keeping a diary, this is not something I have done before and honestly it felt like
a bit of a chore. However, I did decide to keep a log of all the people I met along the way.

It is important to note that this data is only representative of people that I approached and had a meaningful interaction with
or vice-versa. Therefore, this is not necessarily indicative of the entire travelling population. Factors such as my
rudimentary Spanish, joining English-speaking tours and generally seeking out people of a similar demographic to myself will bias this
data heavily. 

What constitutes as a meaningful interaction? Simply whether I remembered the person when it came to updating the log, usually 2-4 weeks from the date of us meeting.

When plotting the nationalities of fellow travellers on a Cloropleth Map, it can be seen that people I met tend to be from countries

Some surprises for me were 
1) Not meeting anybody from either Africa or Asia (not including Russia and Turkey).
2) The number of Israelis I met (9) especially considering many do not have a level of English to converse confidently and groups of Israelis often stick together in hostels. This was a common complaint of those that I befriended.
3) Not meeting any Irish people for the first 5 months until I was on a tour with a group of 6 of them.

Something that immediately catches my eye here is the number of entries at age = 27. This is likely because I did not ask everybody their age and often had to make an
educated guess. I suspect the question I asked myself at the time was 'Do I think they're about the same age as me?'.

While not as pronounced, a similar effect can be observed at ages of 5 year intervals i.e. 30, 40, 45. I almost certainly did not ask the ages of those above 50.

Something else that catches my eye is the strange clustering between males and females for those I met at my accommodation. The below
swarm plot focuses on just this category with a toggle to separate the sexes onto different lines

As a solo traveller you often go out of your way to meet other people. This is reflected in the data in both senses, I was looking for
