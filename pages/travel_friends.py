st.write("""Between 6th January 2023 and 20th July 2023 I travelled through 4 countries in South America: Peru, Chile, Argentina and Bolivia. My original plan
was to spend a few weeks in Spanish school in Lima, Peru before venturing into Patagonia with my backpack and my tent.
There were no solid plans after that, I was just going to see what felt interesting at the time.

Early on I decided against keeping a diary, this is not something I have done before and honestly it felt like
a bit of a chore. However, I did decide to keep a log of all the people I met along the way.

It is important to note that this data is only representative of people that I approached and had a meaningful interaction with
or vice-versa. Therefore, this is not necesarily indicative of the entire travelling population. Factors such as my
rudeimentary Spanish, joining English-speaking tours and generally seeking out people of a similar demographic to myself will bias this
data heavily. It is perhaps no surprise that the most common nationality of people I met is the same as mine, British.""")

As mentioned in the introduction, with the exception of the Countries I visited, 
the map consists almost entirely of countries that are well-developed and have a high proportion of English sepakers.
            
Some surprises for me were 
1) Not meeting anybody from either Asia (not including Russia and Turkey) or Africa.
2) The number of Israelis I met (9) especially considering many do not have a level of English to be confident with AND groups of Israelis often stick together in hostels. This was a common complaint of those that I befriended.
3) Not meeting any Irish for the first 5 months until I was on a tour with a group of 6 of them.

Each country looks roughly proportional to the amount of time I spent in each, however, my experiences were rather different from Country to Country:
            
<ul>
            <li> In <b>Peru</b> my main activities were Spanish School and the Salkantay trek, both of which meant spending considerable time with the same people.
            <li> In <b>Chile</b> I was primarily hiking and camping solo, however, I did depend on hitchhiking a lot for transportation.
            <li> <b>Argentina</b> was the country I spent by far the most time in and through my girlfriend met many locals.
            <li> I spent the least time in <b>Bolivia</b> but did take another two weeks of Spanish Lessons which invariably leads to making connections.
